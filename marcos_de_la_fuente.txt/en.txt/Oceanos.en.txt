We are water that thinks
water that feels
 
In the wisdom of the water that has traveled so far
we will leave our tincture as a gift
 
We are water that feels
water that thinks
 
The waves fall on the fabric you knead
Guessing the future at the seams
Rampant scars that carry a message
 
We are water that thinks
Water hat feels

Somos auga que pensa
auga que sinte
 
Na sabedoría da auga que tanto percorreu
deixaremos a nosa tintura como agasallo
e ó que permanece non pesa mais do que levamos
 
Somos auga que sinte
auga que pensa
 
Caen as ondas no tecido que amasas
Adivíñase o futuro nas costuras
Cicatrices rampantes que portan unha mensaxe
 
Somos auga que pensa
Auga que sinte

Icy planets migrating inland for warmth
Giant ice-covered asteroids crashing into Earth


SEAS DYING

The Baltic will be the first
The Adriatic will come later
The Mediterranean will die as emigrants die in it

No islands
No land
No souls filling the graveyard liquid

Tidal seas getting dizzy and falling
One after another
To the dark mire

Cooling us they warm up
They pay a high price
Maintain the lives of your children's children who were once heaven
They were heaven and us sea
Sea we are still
We continue
Warming the future, burning
We will miss the gills, we will miss
Those that we did not want, that quickly fell
The lungs, limited and dry, will drown in crying
In greed
In contempt
In the madness of burning down the house you live in

No inheritance
No legacy
Without land it was a barren desert
Without life, because we will not be able to return to the house


THE ABANDONED HOME

Life started at sea
Will end at sea

The sea is the house that we have abandoned

You don't remember anymore?
We were happy living in the sea
Physical in the liquid
Floating without gravity
Broad-gilled normal mermaids
Parading on the reefs
We dreamed of breathing out of the water
And now

You don't remember anymore?
When the tide brought us food
More than we needed
Like a gift that we destroy in the hands of the one who offers it

Children of Uranus
Ungrateful we are
We will be banished


CORAL

Sensitive protective skeleton of the banks
that you invented the colors


TIDES

The moon breathing
deep in the waves


NUNCA MAIS

Nunca Mais turned out to be
our everyday problem


PLASTIC ISLAND

Plastic floats
Not so the meat and bones
