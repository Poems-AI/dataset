The Green Dream

A garden is growing in Willy 
the green dream in front of the Deli 
a wall painted by a family 
we have the force like the Jedi

La Casa is rise on the feelings
you can see this like a journey 
we love when you feel inspired
welcome to our Secret Garden

You could wear only these bubbles
or to buy one of those paintings 
this is a space for the artists
to build together the empathy muscle

This is only the beginning
you could be part of this fire
burn with us, the world is watching
all the things that happen in the Secret Garden
