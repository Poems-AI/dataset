Love... which love? \n
What this word mean? \n
What this word mean if you love someone you did not even see his face? \n
What this word mean if you love someone you did not even hear his voice? \n
You know him just by talking on glassy screen \n
You feel that you know him since long time \n
You feel that this one is the perfect person to be your best friend \n
You see him like an angel fall from the sky to take you to the heaven \n
But why? \n
Why you put your trust in this person \n
How do you know that he did not lie on you? \n
Also you can not confess that you can not believe that this person may be will lie on you \n
Or if he consider that you are just lie in his life \n
Because his friendship blinded you \n
You do not care what he believes in or what his ideas in this life \n
You know that you are in another life \n
But you have to know that you do the truth \n
Because you can not stop your heart of doing something \n<|endoftext|>

What is love? \n
An abstract word thrown recklessly about, \n
in this modern age of chaos. \n
Uttered between emotionally charged individuals, \n
crying out to find a reason; \n
A reason for life, a meaning for existance. \n
Perhaps this is so; \n
But without love, this world would descend \n
Into the realm of hatred that entangles it. \n
To me, you embody love! \n
Despite the endless trials and turmoil, \n
Your tender heart breathes affection. \n
Your compassionate soul seeks to find \n
The feature of redemption in all. \n
No malice can survive the torrent of love, \n
That courses through your veins. \n
Encompassing your heart with a halo, \n
of breathtaking sparkles. \n
When you walk in a room, you radiate love, \n
The room becomes a spectrum of light; \n
Tendrils of light that unfurl blissfully, \n
And shed gold on the darkest of places. \n
The smile on your face, so pure and so kind, \n
Embodies the child within - \n
The irrational, unquestioning, bravest of love, \n
That dares to shine out in the dark. \n
You are my angel; \n
Never change. \n<|endoftext|>

I saw an angel with a broken wing \n
I saw an angel cry \n
I mended it with bits of string \n
And told her she could fly. \n
I handed her my handkerchief \n
To wipe the tear away \n
And told her all was well again \n
I think I made her day. \n
She thanked me with an angel's kiss \n
And like a butterfly \n
She closed her wings then opened them \n
And rose into the sky. \n
Now she is back in heaven \n
And I'm here on the ground \n
And I think somehow that we got \n
Our roles the wrong way round. \n<|endoftext|>

Love is some trick \n
You play on me, \n
Some sleight, some glance, \n
Tenacity! \n
You tumble the sheets \n
At my marriage bed \n
And ride with me, desperately \n
Angel Head. \n
Caught at your eyes, \n
Your thighs, your touch, \n
I ramp at your sighs \n
Your cries – Enough! \n
Then drown in lips \n
That would raise me, dead, \n
And sleep at you breathlessly, \n
Angel Head. \n

I heard an Angel singing \n
When the day was springing, \n
'Mercy, Pity, Peace \n
Is the world's release.' \n
Thus he sung all day \n
Over the new mown hay, \n
Till the sun went down \n
And haycocks looked brown. \n
I heard a Devil curse \n
Over the heath and the furze, \n
'Mercy could be no more, \n
If there was nobody poor, \n
And pity no more could be, \n
If all were as happy as we.' \n
At his curse the sun went down, \n
And the heavens gave a frown. \n
Down pour'd the heavy rain \n
Over the new reap'd grain ... \n
And Miseries' increase \n
Is Mercy, Pity, Peace. \n<|endoftext|>

They met back when they were both young \n
She gave him the love and the hope that he \n
Needed to fulfill his dreams \n
Now she is the lost angel he misses at night \n
She watches over him day and night \n
Trying to keep him out of harms way \n
Never knowing if he'll listen to her whispers of \n
warning and love \n
A lost angel to him \n
Yet she's not so far away \n
Trying to get through to him \n
To let him know she's okay \n
'I'll never leave you \n
I'll never stop loving you \n
I'll always be here for you just call my name' \n
She is constantly whispering that to her lover \n
Letting him know that she hasn't left him \n
She will constantly be near in his heart to protect \n
and love him \n
He may think she is a lost angel but if he listens \n
to the wind she is talking to him constantly \n
A lost angel with a goal \n
To protect and love the one she loves \n
To guide him through until the right time \n
Always whispering and saying \n
'Call my name and I'll be there' \n
She doesn't want him to stop loving others \n
Actually she wants him to live his life \n
After all there is time for her to love and \n
protect him \n
'Wait until the time is right \n
You will know when it is time to come home to me \n
For I will be there with open arms \n
To hold you close and never let go' \n
'Always know that I love you \n
I will never leave you alone in this world \n
You'll find another love and give her your heart \n
While knowing that I am there with you' \n
A lost angel smiled for a change \n
When the man she loves listened to her advice \n
Now he knows his lost angel never left \n
She is always by his side \n
The love of his life \n
His lost angel \n<|endoftext|>

In the darkness of your sorrow \n
In the emptiness of grief \n
When the hope of understanding has gone dim, \n
From a realm beyond the senses \n
Comes a warmth beyond belief \n
As silent wings enfold your troubled soul: \n
Let an angel work its wonder \n
Let it circle you with light \n
As you sacrifice the burdens of your heart, \n
Soon the fearfulness is lifted \n
With the darkness of the night \n
Let the wonders of your spirit be restored; \n
For an angel has embraced you \n
With a passion undefined, \n
An endless love surpassing time and space - \n
And once that love has touched you \n
You will know beyond the mind \n

Sometimes life gives us severe shock, \n
Undermines the plans and does block, \n
The ways of wisdom leading ahead, \n
Reveals the hands that secretly mock. \n
An artist thought to paint an angel, \n
To use the brush for the masterpiece, \n
But could not conceptualize the image, \n
Beauty combining innocence, purity. \n
One morn, at last, he luckily found, \n
A child playing on the grassy ground, \n
Having angelic countenance and grace, \n
Incarnation he was of sublime serenity. \n
Painted he the angel with skill utmost, \n
And earned he the world wide fame. \n
And he after three full fleeting decades, \n
Thought for the second master-sketch, \n
Now not of an angel, but of a devil. \n
He sought for the image far and wide, \n
But could not find corresponding one, \n
Fate then led him amid the prison walls, \n
There inside met he a young wretch man, \n
With a devilish nature, face and frame. \n
The master revealed his intent to paint, \n
Tears came in eyes of the devil formed, \n
Said he, “Oh! Master it is a matter of woe, \n
You sketched me an angel thirty years ago.” \n<|endoftext|>

limestone, with traces of polychromy, c. 1250 \n
Point Dume was the point, \n
he said, but we never came close, \n
no matter how far we walked the shale \n
broken from California. \n
Someone's garden \n
had slipped, hanging itself by a vine \n
from the cliffs of some new Babylon \n
past Malibu. \n
Drowning the words, \n
the wind didn't fling back in our faces, \n
the Pacific washed up a shell: \n
around an alabastron \n
of salt water for the dead, \n
seaweed rustled its papers, drying them out, \n
until it died. Waves kept crashing \n
into the heart \n
of each shell \n
I held to my ear like a phone, \n
but they were just the waves of my blood. \n
And through it all \n
I heard him say, \n
how could it be nine months ago \n
his grandson had taken his own life, \n
somewhere back east? \n
He was fifteen. \n
O Pacific, what good is our grief? \n
Something screamed at the sandy child \n
who poured seawater \n
into a hole. \n
Child, you'll never empty the ocean, \n
Augustine said. How can I believe? \n
The wet fist of a wave \n
dissolved in sand. \n
Like a saint, a seagull flapped down the beach \n
in search of something raw—an angel \n
with an empty pail? \n
No, a teenage boy, \n
hands big as a man's, held a sea slug \n
quaking like an aspic. Under a rock, another \n
drew into its body \n
a creature \n
larger than itself. Live, said Death, \n
to child and childless alike, indifferently. \n

So sweet; so innocent, the child of heaven \n
Fallen into revulsion, called Earth \n
Calling out to the depraved to love \n
And be loved \n
Innocent child; you are a fatuous Angel \n
An Angel, who should have come \n
Long before the conception of aversion \n
You could have saved the lives \n
of the fools that have forsaken and \n
destroyed what was built for them \n
Angel Child, can you save the fallen world now? \n
I think not! \n

Our salvation is lost! \n
Our hopes are dissolved in desolation \n
I was once a believer, Angel Child \n
But now I do not know what to believe in \n
I do not feel \n
And I fear I have lost myself \n
I envision that tomorrow will bring yet more sorrow \n
Why have you come now \n
when life has lost its continuum \n
I once dreamt of peace, purity, concord, entente \n
Now I dream of madness! \n
Madness that has invaded this world \n
Madness that dwells on war, violence, antipathy, perversion \n
And so on \n
I hate the way we die in bloodshed \n
On what was once the Promised Land \n
Is it a test that God is showering on us \n
to consummation \n
Ha! I laugh at you, because you finally made me doubt \n
And hope once more \n
Hope for change! \n
Hope for salvation! \n
Angel you give hope and abandon us \n
And leave us to the wrath of humanity \n
Don’t do this to me! \n
Not now; not ever \n
Go away and leave me alone \n
Change the world Angel; and I will venerate you! \n

I love to be free, among the clouds \n
And dancing, \n
It is here, where I meet with you, \n
Among the clouds romancing. \n
Unbinding are my hands, \n
As you set me free \n
You set my soul on fire \n
Enchanted, I climb high and higher \n
The pill, the coating \n
My angel, my plaything \n
Lighting flashes through the rain, \n
You come walking clearing the way \n
You move around me filling my chest, invoking emotions \n
An Aphrodite teasing priestess, and here in the heat of the night \n
And the light of the day, you remove everything \n
That ever stood in my way \n
The crash of confusion and the weight of dismay \n
Is halted, lifted and taken away \n
Replaced with enchantment and lyrical gift \n
Smoothing over the cracks of inner personal rift \n
The aches the pains, there all pulled away \n
By horse drawn chariots, made of gold clay \n
Enlightenment falls upon me, from emotional release \n
In this realm where I lay with ease, surrounded by passionate love and harmonious peace \n
Your invoked emotions become entrancing \n
My analgesic angel, my psychedelic plaything \n
I take your hand, and you entwine with mine \n
The air falls silently still, seduction of my mind and will \n
I fall into you, you become one with me \n
You are my paradise shore, I’m you amorous sea \n
Frolicking in the surf with whispers of love, \n
Transfiguration of its purity into the whitest of doves \n
With exquisite form a launch from surf to sky \n
And now air born once more we fly, into tranquillity \n
Through the all Seeing Eye, a thunderous crash entering \n
The kaleidoscope sky, toward our final nirvana and our ultimate heights \n
As we now start the end of our heaven spent time in \n
The world, the realms and the clouds of the sky, the \n
Imprinted memories dress the sky as stars, and find the glowing \n
Sparkling spectacle further more enchants my mind \n
A roar thunder and a bolt of light the advancing \n
Waves of clouds unite, approaching faster then \n
A ferocious tide, time is almost up, on my \n
Analgesic angel and on the only world I dearly love \n
The air begins to whisper, a reduction of my mind and will \n
You hand slips go as you leave and untwines itself from me \n
My analgesic angel my psychedelic plaything \n
You revoke the emotions that are still entrancing \n
No more at ease, at a loss without the passionate love and harmonious peace \n
The enlightenment lifts from me, from emotional retreat \n
The horse drawn chariots made of gold clay \n
Pulling the return of the aches and the pains \n
Fracture again the surface of inner personal rift \n
Retracted and chained is the enchantment and lyrical gift \n
The crash of confusion and the weight of dismay \n
Is returning heavy and heading my way \n
Without the heat of the night and the light of the day \n
Everything that returns will remain in my way \n
Revoked emotions now fleeing my chest, from a retreating \n
Aphrodite teasing priestess \n
The pill, the coating \n
My angel, my plaything \n
Lighting flashes bringing the rain, \n
You go leaving and obscuring the way \n
Binding are my hands, \n
As without you I’m not free \n
Extinguish my burning soul \n
Disenchanted, I fall, fall and fall \n
I love to be free, among the clouds \n
And dancing, \n
And I will return in time, as this \n

Resides discreetly, somewhere in my mind \n<|endoftext|>

Win that fix it, will that arrange the \n

Yellow sky. \n
Faint cricket in the dried-out bush. \n
As I approach, my footfall in the leaves \n
drowns out the cricket-chirping I was \n
coming close to hear \n
Yellow sky with black leaves rearranging it. \n
Wind rearranging the black leaves in it. \n
But anyway I am indoors, of course, and this is a pane, here, \n
and I have arranged the flowers for you \n
again. Have taken the dead cordless ones, the yellow bits past apogee, \n
the faded cloth, the pollen-free abandoned marriage-hymn \n
back out, leaving the few crisp blooms to swagger, winglets, limpid \n
debris \n
Shall I arrange these few remaining flowers? \n
Shall I rearrange these gossamer efficiencies? \n
Please don't touch me with your skin. \n
Please let the thing evaporate. \n
Please tell me clearly what it is. \n
The party is so loud downstairs, bristling with souvenirs. \n
It's a philosophy of life, of course, \n
drinks fluorescent, whips of syntax in the air \n
above the heads -- how small they seem from here, \n
the bobbing universal heads, stuffing the void with eloquence, \n
and also tiny merciless darts \n
of truth. It's pulled on tight, the air they breathe and rip. \n
It's like a prize the way it's stretched on tight \n
over the voices, keeping them intermingling, forcing the breaths to \n
marry, marry, \n
cunning little hermeneutic cupola, \n
dome of occasion in which the thoughts re- \n
group, the footprints stall and gnaw in tiny ruts, \n
the napkins wave, are waved , the honeycombing \n
thoughts are felt to dialogue, a form of self- \n
congratulation, no?, or is it suffering? I'm a bit \n
dizzy up here rearranging things, \n
they will come up here soon, and need a setting for their fears, \n
and loves, an architecture for their evolutionary \n
morphic needs -- what will they need if I don't make the place? -- \n
what will they know to miss?, what cry out for, what feel the bitter \n
restless irritations \n
for? A bit dizzy from the altitude of everlastingness, \n
the tireless altitudes of the created place, \n
in which to make a life -- a liberty -- the hollow, fetishized, and starry \n
place, \n
a bit gossamer with dream, a vortex of evaporations, \n
oh little dream, invisible city, invisible hill \n
I make here on the upper floors for you -- \n
down there, where you are entertained, where you are passing \n
time, there's glass and moss on air, \n
there's the feeling of being numerous, mouths submitting to air, lips \n
to protocol, \n
and dreams of sense, tongues, hinges, forceps clicking \n
in anticipation ofas if the moment, freeze-burned by accuracies--of \n
could be thawed open into life again \n
by gladnesses, by rectitude -- no, no -- by the sinewy efforts at \n
sincerity -- can't you feel it gliding round you, \n
mutating, yielding the effort-filled phrases of your talk to air, \n
compounding, stemming them, honeying-open the sheerest \n
innuendoes till \n
the rightness seems to root, in the air, in the compact indoor sky, \n
and the rest, all round, feels like desert, falls away, \n
and you have the sensation of muscular timeliness,and you feel the calligraphic in you reach out like a soul \n
into the midst of others, in conversation, \n
gloved by desire, into the tiny carnage \n
of opinionsSo dizzy. Life buzzing beneath me \n
though my feeling says the hive is gone, queen gone, \n
the continuum continuing beneath, busy, earnest, in con- \n
versation. Shall I prepare. Shall I put this further \n
to the left, shall I move the light, the point-of-view, the shades are \n
drawn, to cast a glow resembling disappearance, slightly red, \n
will that fix it, will that make clear the task, the trellised ongoingness \n
and all these tiny purposes, these parables, this marketplace \n
of tightening truths? \n
Oh knit me that am crumpled dust, \n
the heap is all dispersed. Knit me that am. Say therefore. Say \n
philosophy and mean by that the pane. \n

The Heaven vests for Each \n
In that small Deity \n
It craved the grace to worship \n
Some bashful Summer's Day— \n
Half shrinking from the Glory \n
It importuned to see \n
Till these faint Tabernacles drop \n
In full Eternity— \n
How imminent the Venture— \n
As one should sue a Star— \n
For His mean sake to leave the Row \n
And entertain Despair— \n
A Clemency so common— \n
We almost cease to fear— \n
Enabling the minutest— \n
And furthest—to adore— \n<|endoftext|>
heaven \n
243 \n
I've known a Heaven, like a Tent— \n
To wrap its shining Yards— \n
Pluck up its stakes, and disappear— \n
Without the sound of Boards \n
Or Rip of Nail—Or Carpenter— \n
But just the miles of Stare— \n
That signalize a Show's Retreat— \n
In North America— \n
No Trace—no Figment of the Thing \n
That dazzled, Yesterday, \n
No Ring—no Marvel— \n
Men, and Feats— \n
Dissolved as utterly— \n
As Bird's far Navigation \n
Discloses just a Hue— \n
A plash of Oars, a Gaiety— \n
Then swallowed up, of View. \n<|endoftext|>

"Heaven" has different Signs—to me— \n
Sometimes, I think that Noon \n
Is but a symbol of the Place— \n
And when again, at Dawn, \n
A mighty look runs round the World \n
And settles in the Hills— \n
An Awe if it should be like that \n
Upon the Ignorance steals— \n
The Orchard, when the Sun is on— \n
The Triumph of the Birds \n
When they together Victory make— \n
Some Carnivals of Clouds— \n
The Rapture of a finished Day— \n
Returning to the West— \n
All these—remind us of the place \n
That Men call "paradise"— \n
Itself be fairer—we suppose— \n
But how Ourself, shall be \n
Adorned, for a Superior Grace— \n
Not yet, our eyes can see— \n<|endoftext|>
heaven \n
I am being taken to the royal dungeon. \n
I will be killed there tonight, \n
For a crime I never committed, \n
For an action I never thought of. \n
My heart throbs with pain, \n
For I am not the criminal, \n
The criminal they’ve named me as. \n
What is the crime I committed? \n
“He has stolen the Queen’s necklace, they say. \n
I’ve not looked at her highness with my head high, \n
Little did I see her necklace! \n
I’ve fulfilled my duties, Most honestly to date, \n
As the custodian of the Queen’s chamber, \n
Being the Guardsman of the Royal Lady. \n
To be humble was my principle. \n
Responsibility was my slogan. \n
Not once did I sleep, \n
As the blue blooded Lady was asleep. \n
Not once did I fail to bow before her. \n
And this is what I receive, \n
As reward for my sincerity. \n
This is a masquerade; \n
The culprits are behind masks, \n
Masks of innocence. \n
They closed the eyes of justice, \n
With nothing but position. \n
There arouse a tie in the royal court; \n
Between virtues and position, \n
Needless to say, position took over. \n
I am just a common man, \n
A mere servant of the King. \n
But is my life so worthless? \n
Worthless than a necklace? \n
My hands are tied together, \n
The black hood is lowered \n
And it is time for the execution. \n
Alas! I have not lost faith, \n
The lord will see me, \n
See me at the gates of Heaven. \n
Me, a servant so loyal, \n
A true believer of the creator. \n
Faith is what I have, \n
To leave behind as a treasure \n
For my fellow commoners. \n
They are Dullards! You see, \n
Who believe they escaped. \n
The lord sees us all, \n
Our actions accompanied with. \n
He sees us through the clouds, \n
From The Heavens above earth. \n
As death nears, I fear not. \n
Despair does not overcome me, \n
For today I am made the criminal, \n
Tomorrow they will be the same. \n
They’ll be criminals too, \n
Not in the eyes of earthly creatures \n
But, at the doorstep of the Almighty. \n
They’ll be deceived at the gates of Heaven. \n
The rope is being lowered \n
Oh! I am hanged! \n
I’ve left my earthly body, \n
It is just a corpse now. \n
Yes! The Angels are here, \n
Here to take me to Heaven. \n
I’m on my way to see Him, \n
Him, The lord of Lords. \n
Adieu! Adieu to the Royal Fools! ! ! \n<|endoftext|>
heaven \n
Heaven is a place, also a state, \n
It doth all things excel, \n
No man can fully it relate, \n
Nor of its glory tell. \n
God made it for his residence, \n
To sit on as a throne, \n
Which shows to us the excellence \n
Whereby it may be known. \n
Doubtless the fabric that was built \n
For this so great a king, \n
Must needs surprise thee, if thou wilt \n
But duly mind the thing. \n
If all that build do build to suit \n
The glory of their state, \n
What orator, though most acute, \n
Can fully heaven relate? \n
If palaces that princes build, \n
Which yet are made of clay, \n
Do so amaze when much beheld, \n
Of heaven what shall we say? \n
It is the high and holy place; \n
No moth can there annoy, \n
Nor make to fade that goodly grace \n
That saints shall there enjoy. \n
Mansions for glory and for rest \n
Do there prepared stand; \n
Buildings eternal for the blest \n
Are there provided, and \n
The glory and the comeliness \n
By deepest thought none may \n
With heart or mouth fully express, \n
Nor can before that day. \n
These heav'ns we see, be as a scroll, \n
Or garment folded up, \n
Before they do together roll, \n
And we call'd in to sup. \n
There with the king, the bridegroom, and \n
By him are led into \n
His palace chambers, there to stand \n
With his prospect to our view. \n
And taste and smell, and be inflam'd, \n
And ravished to see \n
The buildings he hath for us fram'd, \n
How full of heaven they be. \n
Its state also is marvellous, \n
For beauty to behold; \n
All goodness there is plenteous, \n
And better far than gold. \n
Adorn'd with grace and righteousness, \n
While fragrant scents of love \n
O'erflow with everlasting bliss, \n
All that do dwell above. \n
The heavenly majesty, whose face \n
Doth far exceed the sun, \n
Will there cast forth its rays of grace \n
After this world is done. \n
Which rays and beams will so possess \n
All things that there shall dwell, \n
With so much glory, light, and bliss, \n
That none can think or tell. \n
That wisdom which doth order all \n
Shall there be fully shown; \n
That strength that bears the world there shall \n
By every one be known. \n
That holiness and sanctity \n
Which doth all thought surpass, \n
Shall there in present purity \n
Outshine the crystal glass. \n
The beauty and the comeliness \n
Of this Almighty shall \n
Make amiable with lasting bliss \n
Those he thereto shall call. \n
The presence of this God will be \n
Eternal life in all, \n
And health and gladness, while we see \n
Thy face, O immortal! \n
Here will the Lord make clear and plain \n
How sweetly did agree \n
His attributes, when Christ was slain \n
Our Saviour to be. \n
How wisdom did find out the way, \n
How strength did make him stand, \n
How holiness did bear the sway, \n
And answer just demand. \n
How all these attributes did bend \n
Themselves to work our life, \n
Through the Christ whom God did send \n
To save us by his might. \n
All this will sparkle in our eye \n
Within the holy place, \n
And greatly raise our melody, \n
And flow our hearts with grace. \n
The largest thought that can arise \n
Within the widest heart \n
Shall then be filled with surprize, \n
And pleas'd in every part. \n
All mysteries shall here be seen, \n
And every knot, unty'd; \n
Electing love, that hid hath been, \n
Shall shine on every side. \n
The God of glory here will be \n
The life of every one; \n
Whose goodly attributes shall we \n
Possess them as our own. \n
By wisdom we all things shall know, \n
By light all things shall see, \n
By strength, too, all things we shall do, \n
When we in glory be. \n
The Holy Lamb of God, also, \n
Who for our sakes did die, \n
The holy ones of God shall know, \n
And that most perfectly. \n
Those small and short discoveries \n
That we have of him here, \n
Will there be seen with open eyes, \n
In visions full and clear. \n
Those many thousand acts of grace \n
That here we feel and find, \n
Shall there be real with open face \n
Upon his heart most kind. \n
There he will show us how he was \n
Our prophet, priest, and king; \n
And how he did maintain our cause, \n
And us to glory bring. \n
There we shall see how he was touch'd \n
With all our grief and pain \n
(As in his word he hath avouch'd), \n
When we with him shall reign; \n
He'll show us, also, how he did \n
Maintain our faith and love, \n
And why his face sometimes he hid \n
From us, who are his dove; \n
These tempting times that here we have, \n
We there shall see were good; \n
Also that hidden strength he gave, \n
The purchase of his blood. \n
That he should stand for us before \n
His Father, thus we read. \n
But then shall see, and shall adore \n
Him for his gracious deed. \n
Though we are vile, he without shame \n
Before the angels all \n
Lays out his strength, his worth, and name, \n
For us, who are in thrall. \n
This is he who was mock'd and beat, \n
Spit on, and crown'd with thorns; \n
Who for us had a bloody sweat, \n
Whose heart was broke with scorns. \n
'Tis he who stands so much our friend, \n
As shortly we shall see, \n
With open face, world without end, \n
And in his presence be. \n
That head that once was crown'd with thorns, \n
Shall now with glory shine; \n
That heart that broken was with scorns, \n
Shall flow with life divine; \n
That man that here met with disgrace, \n
We there shall see so bright; \n
That angels can't behold his face \n
For its exceeding light. \n
What gladness will possess our heart \n
When we shall see these things! \n
What light and life, in every part, \n
Will rise like lasting springs! \n
O blessed face and holy grace, \n
When shall we see this day? \n
Lord, fetch us to this goodly place \n
We humbly do thee pray. \n
Next to this Lamb we shall behold \n
All saints, both more and less, \n
With whit'ned robes in glory roll'd, \n
'Cause him they did confess. \n
Each walking in his righteousness \n
With shining crowns of gold, \n
Triumphing still in heav'nly bliss, \n
Amazing to behold. \n
Each person for his majesty \n
Doth represent a king; \n
Yea, angel-like for dignity, \n
And seraphims that sing. \n
Each motion of their mind, and so \n
Each twinkling of their eye; \n
Each word they speak, and step they go, \n
It is in purity. \n
Immortal are they every one, \n
Wrapt up in health and light, \n
Mortality from them is gone, \n
Weakness is turn'd to might. \n
The stars are not so clear as they, \n
They equalize the sun; \n
Their glory shines to perfect day, \n
Which day will ne'er be done. \n
No sorrow can them now annoy, \n
Nor weakness, grief or pain; \n
No faintness can abate their joy, \n
They now in life do reign. \n
They shall not there, as here, be vex'd \n
With Satan, men, or sin; \n
Nor with their wicked hearts perplex'd, \n
The heavens have cop'd[8] them in. \n
Thus, as they shine in their estate, \n
So, too, in their degree; \n
Which is most goodly to relate, \n
And ravishing to see. \n
The majesty whom they adore, \n
Doth them in wisdom place \n
Upon the thrones, and that before \n
The angels, to their grace. \n
The saints of the Old Testament, \n
Full right to their degree; \n
Likewise the New, in excellent \n
Magnificency be. \n
Each one his badge of glory wears, \n
According to his place; \n
According as was his affairs \n
Here, in the time of grace. \n
Some on the right hand of the Lamb, \n
Likewise some on the left, \n
With robes and golden chains do stand \n
Most grave, most sage, and deft.[9] \n
The martyr here is known from him \n
Who peaceably did die, \n
Both by the place he sitteth in, \n
And by his dignity. \n
Each father, saint, and prophet shall, \n
According to his worth, \n
Enjoy the honour of his call, \n
And plainly hold it forth. \n
Those bodies which sometimes were torn, \n
And bones that broken were \n
For God's word; he doth now adorn \n
With health and glory fair. \n
Thus, when in heav'nly harmony \n
These blessed saints appear, \n
Adorn'd with grace and majesty, \n
What gladness will be there! \n
The light, and grace, and countenance, \n
The least of these shall have, \n
Will so with terror them advance, \n
And make their face so grave, \n
That at them all the world will shake, \n
When they lift up their head; \n
Princes and kings will at them quake, \n
And fall before them dead. \n
This shall we see, thus shall we be, \n
O would the day were come, \n
Lord Jesus take us up to thee, \n
To this desired home. \n
Angels also we shall behold, \n
When we on high ascend, \n
Each shining like to men of gold, \n
And on the Lord attend. \n
These goodly creatures, full of grace, \n
Shall stand about the throne, \n
Each one with lightning in his face, \n
And shall to us be known. \n
These cherubims with one accord \n
Shall cry continually, \n
Ah, holy, holy, holy, Lord, \n
And heavenly majesty. \n
These will us in their arms embrace, \n
And welcome us to rest, \n
And joy to see us clad with grace, \n
And of the heavens possess'd. \n
This we shall hear, this we shall see, \n
While raptures take us up, \n
When we with blessed Jesus be, \n
And at his table sup. \n
Oh shining angels! what, must we \n
With you lift up our voice? \n
We must; and with you ever be, \n
And with you must rejoice. \n
Our friends that lived godly here, \n
Shall there be found again; \n
The wife, the child, and father dear, \n
With others of our train. \n
Each one down to the foot in white, \n
Fill'd to the brim with grace, \n
Walking among the saints in light, \n
With glad and joyful face. \n
Those God did use us to convert, \n
We there with joy shall meet, \n
And jointly shall, with all our heart, \n
In life each other greet. \n
A crown to them we then shall be, \n
A glory and a joy; \n
And that before the Lord, when he \n
The world comes to destroy. \n
This is the place, this is the state, \n
Of all that fear the Lord; \n
Which men nor angels may relate \n
With tongue, or pen, or word. \n
No night is here, for to eclipse \n
Its spangling rays so bright; \n
Nor doubt, nor fear to shut the lips, \n
Of those within this light. \n
The strings of music here are tun'd \n
For heavenly harmony, \n
And every spirit here perfum'd \n
With perfect sanctity. \n
Here runs the crystal streams of life, \n
Quite through all our veins. \n
And here by love we do unite \n
With glory's golden chains. \n
Now that which sweet'neth all will be \n
The lasting of this state; \n
This heightens all we hear or see \n
To a transcendant rate. \n
For should the saints enjoy all this \n
But for a certain time, \n
O, how would they their mark then miss, \n
And at this thing repine? \n
Yea, 'tis not possible that they \n
Who then shall dwell on high, \n
Should be content, unless they may \n
Dwell there eternally. \n
A thought of parting with this place \n
Would bitter all their sweet, \n
And darkness put upon the face \n
Of all they there do meet. \n
But far from this the saints shall be, \n
Their portion is the Lord, \n
Whose face for ever they shall see, \n
As saith the holy word. \n
And that with everlasting peace, \n
Joy, and felicity, \n
From this time forth they shall increase \n
Unto eternity. \n<|endoftext|>

Two lovers to a midnight meadow came \n
High in the hills, to lie there hand and hand \n
Like effigies and look up at the stars, \n
The never-setting ones set in the North \n
To circle the Pole in idiot majesty, \n
And wonder what was given them to wonder. \n
Being amateurs, they knew some of the names \n
By rote, and could attach the names to stars \n
And draw the lines invisible between \n
That humbled all the heavenly things to farm \n
And forest things and even kitchen things, \n
A bear, a wagon, a long handled ladle; \n
Could wonder at the shadow of the world \n
That brought those lights to light, could wonder too \n
At the ancestral eyes and the dark mind \n
Behind them that had reached the length of light \n
To name the stars and draw the animals \n
And other stuff that dangled in the height, \n
Or was it the deep? Did they look in \n
Or out, the lovers? till they grew bored \n
As even lovers will, and got up to go, \n
But drunken now, with staggering and dizziness, \n
Because the spell of earth had moved them so, \n
Hallucinating that the heavens moved. \n<|endoftext|>

Heaven is not a place; it is a state; \n
not in the clouds, nor here on earth beneath; \n
heaven's not in front, behind, nor left nor right - \n
and yet, in love it comprehends all these. \n
God is not found by silence, nor by speech; \n
not found by fasting, nor by finest food; \n

and yet, within all these, and all around. \n
There's nowhere, thus, to go; for all is here; \n
and nought to do but, present, here to rest; \n
and resting, wish and will and love God dear \n
with full intent; no other interest. \n
All's within the heart, so vast, so great - \n
for heaven's not a place; it is a state. \n<|endoftext|>

If you were twenty-seven \n
and had done time for beating \n
our ex-wife and had \n
no dreams you remembered \n
in the morning, you might \n
lie on your bed and listen \n
to a mad canary sing \n
and think it all right to be \n
there every Saturday \n
ignoring your neighbors, the streets, \n
the signs that said join, \n
and the need to be helping. \n
You might build, as he did, \n
a network of golden ladders \n
so that the bird could roam \n
on all levels of the room; \n
you might paint the ceiling blue, \n
the floor green, and shade \n
the place you called the sun \n
so that things came softly to order \n
when the light came on. \n
He and the bird lived \n
in the fine weather of heaven; \n
they never aged, they \n
never tired or wanted \n
all through that war, \n
but when it was over \n
and the nation had been saved, \n
he knew they'd be hunted. \n
He knew, as you would too, \n
that he'd be laid off \n
for not being braver \n
and it would do no good \n
to show how he had taken \n
clothespins and cardboard \n
and made each step safe. \n
It would do no good \n
to have been one of the few \n
that climbed higher and higher \n
even in time of war, \n

asking for their share, \n

marriage \n
King Arthur lives in merry Carleile, \n
And seemely is to see; \n
And there with him queene Guenever, \n
That bride soe bright of blee. \n
And there with him queene Guenever, \n
That bride so bright in bowre: \n
And all his barons about him stoode, \n
That were both stiffe and stowre. \n
The king a royale Christmasse kept, \n
With mirth and princelye cheare; \n
To him repaired many a knighte, \n
That came both farre and neare. \n
And when they were to dinner sette, \n
And cups went freely round; \n
Before them came a faire damsèlle, \n
And knelt upon the ground. \n
A boone, a boone, O kinge Arthùre, \n
I beg a boone of thee; \n
Avenge me of a carlish knighte, \n
Who hath shent my love and me. \n
At Tearne-Wadling his castle stands, \n
Near to that lake so fair, \n
And proudlye rise the battlements, \n
And streamers deck the air. \n
Noe gentle knighte, nor ladye gay, \n
May pass that castle-walle: \n
But from that foule discurteous knighte, \n
Mishappe will them befalle. \n
Hee's twyce the size of common men, \n
Wi' thewes, and sinewes stronge, \n
And on his backe he bears a clubbe, \n
That is both thicke and longe. \n
This grimme baròne 'twas our harde happe, \n
But yester morne to see; \n
When to his bowre he bare my love, \n
And sore misused mee. \n
And when I told him, king Arthùre \n
As lyttle shold him spare; \n
Goe tell, sayd hee, that cuckold kinge, \n
To meete mee if he dare. \n
Upp then sterted king Arthùre, \n
And sware by hille and dale, \n
He ne'er wolde quitt that grimme baròne, \n
Till he had made him quail. \n
Goe fetch my sword Excalibar: \n
Goe saddle mee my steede; \n
Nowe, by my faye, that grimme baròne \n
Shall rue this ruthfulle deede. \n
And when he came to Tearne Wadlinge \n
Benethe the castle walle: \n
"Come forth; come forth; thou proude baròne, \n
Or yielde thyself my thralle." \n
On magicke grounde that castle stoode, \n
And fenc'd with many a spelle: \n
Noe valiant knighte could tread thereon, \n
But straite his courage felle. \n
Forth then rush'd that carlish knight, \n
King Arthur felte the charme: \n
His sturdy sinewes lost their strengthe, \n
Downe sunke his feeble arme. \n
Nowe yield thee, yield thee, kinge Arthùre, \n
Now yield thee, unto mee: \n
Or fighte with mee, or lose thy lande, \n
Noe better termes maye bee, \n
Unless thou sweare upon the rood, \n
And promise on thy faye, \n
Here to returne to Tearne-Wadling, \n
Upon the new-yeare's daye; \n
And bringe me worde what thing it is \n
All women moste desyre; \n
This is thy ransome, Arthur, he sayes, \n
Ile have noe other hyre. \n
King Arthur then helde up his hande, \n
And sware upon his faye, \n
Then tooke his leave of the grimme barone \n
And faste hee rode awaye. \n
And he rode east, and he rode west, \n
And did of all inquyre, \n
What thing it is all women crave, \n
And what they most desyre. \n
Some told him riches, pompe, or state; \n
Some rayment fine and brighte; \n
Some told him mirthe; some flatterye; \n
And some a jollye knighte. \n
In letters all king Arthur wrote, \n
And seal'd them with his ringe: \n
But still his minde was helde in doubte, \n
Each tolde a different thinge. \n
As ruthfulle he rode over a more, \n
He saw a ladye sette \n
Betweene an oke, and a greene holléye, \n
All clad in red scarlette. \n
Her nose was crookt and turnd outwàrde, \n
Her chin stoode all awrye; \n
And where as sholde have been her mouthe, \n
Lo! there was set her eye: \n
Her haires, like serpents, clung aboute \n
Her cheekes of deadlye hewe: \n
A worse-form'd ladye than she was, \n
No man mote ever viewe. \n
To hail the king in seemelye sorte \n
This ladye was fulle faine; \n
But king Arthùre all sore amaz'd, \n
No aunswere made againe. \n
What wight art thou, the ladye sayd, \n
That wilt not speake to mee; \n
Sir, I may chance to ease thy paine, \n
Though I be foule to see. \n
If thou wilt ease my paine, he sayd, \n
And helpe me in my neede; \n
Ask what thou wilt, thou grimme ladyè \n
And it shall bee thy meede. \n
O sweare mee this upon the roode, \n
And promise on thy faye; \n
And here the secrette I will telle, \n
That shall thy ransome paye. \n
King Arthur promis'd on his faye, \n
And sware upon the roode; \n
The secrette then the ladye told, \n
As lightlye well shee cou'de. \n
Now this shall be my paye, sir king, \n
And this my guerdon bee, \n
That some yong fair and courtlye knight, \n
Thou bringe to marrye mee. \n
Fast then pricked king Arthùre \n
Ore hille, and dale, and downe: \n
And soone he founde the barone's bowre: \n
And soone the grimme baroùne. \n
He bare his clubbe upon his backe, \n
Hee stoode bothe stiffe and stronge; \n
And, when he had the letters reade, \n
Awaye the lettres flunge. \n
Nowe yielde thee, Arthur, and thy lands, \n
All forfeit unto mee; \n
For this is not thy paye, sir king, \n
Nor may thy ransome bee. \n
Yet hold thy hand, thou proud baròne, \n
I praye thee hold thy hand; \n
And give mee leave to speake once more \n
In reskewe of my land. \n
This morne, as I came over a more, \n
I saw a ladye sette \n
Betwene an oke, and a greene hollèye, \n
All clad in red scarlètte. \n
Shee sayes, all women will have their wille, \n
This is their chief desyre; \n
Now yield, as thou art a barone true, \n
That I have payd mine hyre. \n
An earlye vengeaunce light on her! \n
The carlish baron swore: \n
Shee was my sister tolde thee this, \n
And shee's a mishapen whore. \n
But here I will make mine avowe, \n
To do her as ill a turne: \n
For an ever I may that foule theefe gette, \n

Is there freedom in your marriage? \n
Or is there bondage bringing woe \n
Is there freedom in your marriage? \n
This is what I'd like to know. \n
For marriage is two people \n
Each sharing the others love \n
Not telling each other how to live \n
Nor giving each other the shove. \n
For each is an individual \n
With free-will to be such; \n
Giving and receiving in their talents - \n
However much. \n
Having freedom to enjoy at times \n
What each may like to do; \n
Pleasing each other by attitude \n
Being happy for each too. \n
Standing by each other \n
When outsiders shoot the tongue \n
No matter what the cost might be \n
For freedom you're among. \n
So, is there freedom in your marriage? \n
I pray there is today, \n
For only in love's freedom - \n
Marriage will be for aye! \n<|endoftext|>

Waking alone in a multitude of loves when morning's light \n
Surprised in the opening of her nightlong eyes \n
His golden yesterday asleep upon the iris \n
And this day's sun leapt up the sky out of her thighs \n
Was miraculous virginity old as loaves and fishes, \n
Though the moment of a miracle is unending lightning \n
And the shipyards of Galilee's footprints hide a navy of doves. \n
No longer will the vibrations of the sun desire on \n
Her deepsea pillow where once she married alone, \n
Her heart all ears and eyes, lips catching the avalanche \n
Of the golden ghost who ringed with his streams her mercury bone, \n
Who under the lids of her windows hoisted his golden luggage, \n
For a man sleeps where fire leapt down and she learns through his arm \n
That other sun, the jealous coursing of the unrivalled blood. \n<|endoftext|>

First, marriage should be love \n
all encompassing, total, and free. \n
Love that grows stronger each day \n
soft murmurs of Thee, Thee, Thee. \n
Second, marriage should be sacrifice \n
giving of self, regardless of reward. \n
Gift gladly given, with open heart \n
shielded from life's harsh sword. \n
Third, marriage should be commitment \n
utter loyalty, deep to the bone. \n
Absolutely, no questions asked \n
faithfully promised, never alone. \n
Lastly, marriage should be forever \n
family bonded, yet all still free. \n
Lives joined with love, sacrifice, and commitment \n
an eternity promised with - \n
Thee, Thee, Thee \n<|endoftext|>

Marriage is a punishment; \n
Marriage is an evil that \n
Most can’t but accept. \n
Optimistic views: \n

marriage \n
Aetatis suae fifty-two, \n
A rich Divine began to woo \n
A handsome young imperious girl, \n
Nearly related to an Earl. \n
Her parents and her friends consent, \n
The couple to the temple went. \n
They first invite the Cyprian Queen, \n
’Twas answered, she would not be seen; \n
The Graces next, and all the Muses \n
Were bid in form, but sent excuses. \n
Juno attended at the porch, \n
With farthing candle for a torch, \n
While Mistress Iris held her train, \n
The faded bow distilling rain. \n
Then Hebe came and took her place, \n
But showed no more than half her face. \n
What’er these dire forebodings meant, \n
In mirth the wedding-day was spent; \n
The wedding-day, you take me right, \n
I promise nothing for the night. \n
The bridegroom, dressed to make a figure, \n
Assumes an artificial vigour, \n
A flourished night-cap on to grace \n
His ruddy, wrinkled, smirking face, \n
Like the faint red upon a pippin, \n
Half withered by a winter’s keeping. \n
And thus set out, this happy pair, \n
The Swain is rich, the Nymph is fair; \n
But, which I gladly would forget, \n
The Swain is old, the Nymph coquette; \n
Both from the goal together start, \n
Scarce run a step before they part; \n
No common ligament that binds \n
The various textures of their minds, \n
Their thoughts and actions, hopes and fears, \n
Less corresponding than their years. \n
Her spouse desires his coffee soon, \n
She rises to her tea at noon. \n
While he goes out to cheapen books, \n
She at the glass consults her looks \n
While Betty’s buzzing in her ear, \n
Lord, what a dress these Parsons wear! \n
So odd a choice how could she make? \n
Wished him a Colonel for her sake. \n
Then, on her fingers ends, she counts \n
Exact to what his age amounts; \n
The Dean, she heard her Uncle say, \n
Is fifty, if he be a day; \n
His ruddy cheeks are no disguise; \n
You see the crows-feet round his eyes. \n
At one she rambles to the shops, \n
To cheapen tea, and talk with fops; \n
Or calls a council of her maids \n
And tradesmen, to compare brocades. \n
Her weighty morning business o’er, \n
Sits down to dinner just at four; \n
Minds nothing that is done or said, \n
Her evening work so fills her head. \n
The Dean, who used to dine at one, \n
Is mawkish, and his stomach gone; \n
In thread-bare gown, would scarce a louse hold, \n
Looks like the chaplain of the household, \n
Beholds her from the chaplain’s place \n
In French brocades and Flanders lace; \n
He wonders what employs her brain; \n
But never asks, or asks in vain; \n
His mind is full of other cares, \n
And in the sneaking parson’s airs \n
Computes, that half a parish dues \n
Will hardly find his wife in shoes. \n
Can’st thou imagine, dull Divine, \n
’Twill gain her love to make her fine? \n
Hath she no other wants beside? \n
You raise desire as well as pride, \n
Enticing coxcombs to adore, \n
And teach her to despise thee more. \n
If in her coach she’ll condescend \n
To place him at the hinder end, \n
Her hoop is hoist above his nose, \n
His odious gown would soil her clothes, \n
And drops him at the church, to pray, \n
While she drives on to see the play. \n
He like an orderly Divine \n
Comes home a quarter after nine, \n
And meets her hasting to the Ball: \n
Her chairmen push him from the wall; \n
He enters in, and walks up stairs, \n
And calls the family to prayers, \n
Then goes alone to take his rest \n
In bed, where he can spare her best. \n
At five the footmen make a din, \n
Her Ladyship is just come in; \n
The Masquerade began at two, \n
She stole away with much ado, \n
And shall be chid this afternoon \n
For leaving company so soon; \n
She’ll say, and she may truly say’t, \n
She can’t abide to stay out late. \n
But now, though scarce a twelvemonth married \n
His Lady has twelve times miscarried; \n
The cause, alas, is quickly guessed, \n
The Town has whispered round the jest; \n
Think on some remedy in time, \n
You find His Reverence past his prime, \n
Already dwindled to a lath; \n
No other way but try the Bath. \n
For Venus rising from the ocean, \n
Infused a strong prolific potion, \n
That mixed with Achelaus’ spring, \n
The hornéd flood, as poets sing, \n
Who, with an English Beauty smitten, \n
Ran underground from Greece to Britain, \n
The genial Virtue with him brought, \n
And gave the Nymph a plenteous draught; \n
Then fled, and left his Horn behind \n
For husbands past their youth to find; \n
The Nymph who still with passion burned \n
Was to a boiling fountain turned, \n
Where childless wives crowd every morn \n
To drink in Achelaus’ Horn; \n
And here the father often gains \n
That title by another’s pains. \n
Hither, though much against his grain, \n
The Dean has carried Lady Jane; \n
He for a while would not consent, \n
But vowed his money all was spent; \n
His money spent! a clownish reason! \n
And must My Lady slip her Season? \n
The Doctor with a double fee, \n
Was bribed to make the Dean agree. \n
Here all diversions of the place \n
Are proper in my Lady’s case \n
With which she patiently complies, \n
Merely because her friends advise; \n
His money and her time employs \n
In music, raffling-rooms, and toys, \n
Or in the Cross Bath seeks an heir, \n
Since others oft have found one there; \n
Where if the Dean by chance appears, \n
It shames his cassock and his years; \n
He keeps his distance in the gallery \n
’Till banished by some coxcomb’s raillery, \n
For ’twould his character expose \n
To bathe among the belles and beaux. \n
So have I seen within a pen, \n
Young ducklings fostered by a hen; \n
But when let out, they run and muddle, \n
As instinct leads them, in a puddle; \n
The sober hen, not born to swim, \n
With mournful note clucks round the brim. \n
The Dean, with all his best endeavour, \n
Gets not an heir, but gets a fever; \n
A victim to the last essays \n
Of vigor in declining days, \n
He dies, and leaves his mourning mate \n
(What could he less?) his whole estate. \n
The widow goes through all her forms; \n
New lovers now will come in swarms. \n
Oh, may I see her soon dispensing \n
Her favours to some broken Ensign! \n
Him let her marry for his face, \n
And only coat of tarnished lace; \n
To turn her naked out of doors, \n
And spend her jointure on his whores: \n
But for a parting present leave her \n
A rooted pox to last for ever. \n<|endoftext|>

But let there be spaces in your togetherness, \n
And let the winds of the heavens dance between you. \n
Love one another but make not a bond of love: \n
Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls. \n
Fill each other's cup but drink not from one cup. \n
Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf. \n
Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone, \n
Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music. \n
Give your hearts, but not into each other's keeping. \n
For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts. \n
And stand together, yet not too near together: \n
For the pillars of the temple stand apart, \n
And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow. \n<|endoftext|>
marriage \n
Year 1 \n
Launching our boat \n
On the lake of life. \n
Two eager shipmates \n
Going wherever the gentle breeze \n
Takes us \n
Too caught in each other’s arms and eyes \n
To see where we are \n
Or care \n
Where we are heading. \n
Year 10 \n
Rowing furiously, \n
Back to back. \n
Focused \n
On opposite shores \n
Trying desperately to free ourselves \n
From the other’s grip. \n
Year 25 \n
Now we sit \n
Side by side, \n
Synchronised strokes \n
In our battered boat. \n
Basking in the warmth \n
Of unchallenging \n
Companionship \n
As we enjoy the view \n
Of the journey we’ve shared. \n<|endoftext|>
marriage \n
Hills of Annesley, bleak and barren, \n
Where my thoughtless childhood stray'd, \n
How the northern tempests, warring, \n
Howl above thy tufted shade! \n
Now no more, the hours beguiling, \n
Former favourite haunts I see; \n
Now no more my Mary smiling \n
Makes ye seem a heaven to me. \n<|endoftext|>
marriage \n
Why should a foolish marriage vow, \n
Which long ago was made, \n
Oblige us to each other now, \n
When passion is decayed? \n
We loved, and we loved, as long as we could, \n
Till our love was loved out in us both; \n
But our marriage is dead when the pleasure is fled: \n
'Twas pleasure first made it an oath. \n
If I have pleasures for a friend, \n
And farther love in store, \n
What wrong has he whose joys did end, \n
And who could give no more? \n
'Tis a madness that he should be jealous of me, \n
Or that I should bar him of another; \n
For all we can gain is to give ourselves pain, \n
When neither can hinder the other. \n<|endoftext|>

'Oh well...why not \n
...I suppose! ' \n
she said stripping \n
shyly off her \n

'Oh you...dirty little devil! ' \n
he laughed \n
grabbing her by the calf \n
as she toppled & fell \n
on her back & squealed: \n
'Oh...Heavens! ' \n
a frilly froth of \n
discarded panties \n
crawling across \n
the shag carpet \n
he fallen to his knees \n
trousers trapping his ankles \n
'Jesus! ' he gasped \n
'Oh Christ...! ' she almost \n
prayed. \n
They took each other to the cleaners \n
(& other misdemeanours) \n
went all the way \n

marriage \n
I. \n
I dream of you walking at night along the streams \n
of the country of my birth, warm blooms and the nightsongs \n
of birds opening around you as you walk. \n
You are holding in your body the dark seed of my sleep. \n
II. \n
This comes after silence. Was it something I said \n
that bound me to you, some mere promise \n
or, worse, the fear of loneliness and death? \n
A man lost in the woods in the dark, I stood \n
still and said nothing. And then there rose in me, \n
like the earth's empowering brew rising \n
in root and branch, the words of a dream of you \n
I did not know I had dreamed. I was a wanderer \n
who feels the solace of his native land \n
under his feet again and moving in his blood. \n
I went on, blind and faithful. Where I stepped \n
my track was there to steady me. It was no abyss \n
that lay before me, but only the level ground. \n
III. \n
Sometimes our life reminds me \n
of a forest in which there is a graceful clearing \n
and in that opening a house, \n
an orchard and garden, \n
comfortable shades, and flowers \n
red and yellow in the sun, a pattern \n
made in the light for the light to return to. \n
The forest is mostly dark, its ways \n
to be made anew day after day, the dark \n
richer than the light and more blessed, \n
provided we stay brave \n
enough to keep on going in. \n
IV. \n
How many times have I come to you out of my head \n
with joy, if ever a man was, \n
for to approach you I have given up the light \n
and all directions. I come to you \n
lost, wholly trusting as a man who goes \n
into the forest unarmed. It is as though I descend \n
slowly earthward out of the air. I rest in peace \n
in you, when I arrive at last. \n
V. \n
Our bond is no little economy based on the exchange \n
of my love and work for yours, so much for so much \n
of an expendable fund. We don't know what its limits are-- \n
that puts us in the dark. We are more together \n
than we know, how else could we keep on discovering \n
we are more together than we thought? \n
You are the known way leading always to the unknown, \n
and you are the known place to which the unknown is always \n
leading me back. More blessed in you than I know, \n
I possess nothing worthy to give you, nothing \n
not belittled by my saying that I possess it. \n
Even an hour of love is a moral predicament, a blessing \n
a man may be hard up to be worthy of. He can only \n
accept it, as a plant accepts from all the bounty of the light \n
enough to live, and then accepts the dark, \n
passing unencumbered back to the earth, as I \n
have fallen tine and again from the great strength \n
of my desire, helpless, into your arms. \n
VI. \n
What I am learning to give you is my death \n
to set you free of me, and me from myself \n
into the dark and the new light. Like the water \n
of a deep stream, love is always too much. We \n
did not make it. Though we drink till we burst \n
we cannot have it all, or want it all. \n
In its abundance it survives our thirst. \n
In the evening we come down to the shore \n
to drink our fill, and sleep, while it \n
flows through the regions of the dark. \n
It does not hold us, except we keep returning \n
to its rich waters thirsty. We enter, \n
willing to die, into the commonwealth of its joy. \n
VII. \n
I give you what is unbounded, passing from dark to dark, \n
containing darkness: a night of rain, an early morning. \n
I give you the life I have let live for the love of you: \n
a clump of orange-blooming weeds beside the road, \n
the young orchard waiting in the snow, our own life \n
that we have planted in the ground, as I \n
have planted mine in you. I give you my love for all \n
beautiful and honest women that you gather to yourself \n
again and again, and satisfy--and this poem, \n
no more mine than any man's who has loved a woman. \n<|endoftext|>
marriage \n
THERE was a marriage-table where One sate, \n
Haply, unnoticed, till they craved His aid: \n
Thenceforward does it seem that He has made \n
All virtuous marriage-tables consecrate: \n
And so, at this, where without pomp or state \n
We sit, and only say, or mute, are fain \n
To wish the simple words 'God bless these twain!' \n
I think that He who 'in the midst' doth wait \n
Oft-times, would not abjure our prayerful cheer, \n
But, as at Cana, list with gracious ear \n
To us, beseeching, that the Love divine \n
May ever at their household table sit, \n
Make all His servants who encompass it, \n
And change life's bitterest waters into wine. \n<|endoftext|>
marriage \n
Light, so low upon earth, \n
You send a flash to the sun. \n
Here is the golden close of love, \n
All my wooing is done. \n
Oh, the woods and the meadows, \n
Woods where we hid from the wet, \n
Stiles where we stay'd to be kind, \n
Meadows in which we met! \n
Light, so low in the vale \n
You flash and lighten afar, \n
For this is the golden morning of love, \n
And you are his morning start. \n
Flash, I am coming, I come, \n
By meadow and stile and wood, \n
Oh, lighten into my eyes and heart, \n
Into my heart and my blood! \n
Heart, are you great enough \n
For a love that never tires? \n
O' heart, are you great enough for love? \n
I have heard of thorns and briers, \n
Over the meadow and stiles, \n
Over the world to the end of it \n
Flash for a million miles. \n<|endoftext|>
poem \n
That Providence which had so long the care \n
Of Cromwell's head, and numbred ev'ry hair, \n
Now in its self (the Glass where all appears) \n
Had seen the period of his golden Years: \n
And thenceforth onely did attend to trace, \n
What death might least so sair a Life deface. \n
The People, which what most they fear esteem, \n
Death when more horrid so more noble deem; \n
And blame the last Act, like Spectators vain, \n
Unless the Prince whom they applaud be slain. \n
Nor Fate indeed can well refuse that right \n
To those that liv'd in War, to dye in Fight. \n
But long his Valour none had left that could \n
Indanger him, or Clemency that would. \n
And he whom Nature all for Peace had made, \n
But angry Heaven unto War had sway'd, \n
And so less useful where he most desir'd, \n
For what he least affected was admir'd, \n
Deserved yet an End whose ev'ry part \n
Should speak the wondrous softness of his Heart. \n
To Love and Grief the fatal Writ was sign'd; \n
(Those nobler weaknesses of humane Mind, \n
From which those Powers that issu'd the Decree, \n
Although immortal, found they were not free.) \n
That they, to whom his Breast still open lyes, \n
In gentle Passions should his Death disguise: \n
And leave succeeding Ages cause to mourn, \n
As long as Grief shall weep, or Love shall burn. \n
Streight does a slow and languishing Disease \n
Eliza, Natures and his darling, seize. \n
Her when an infant, taken with her Charms, \n
He oft would flourish in his mighty Arms; \n
And, lest their force the tender burthen wrong, \n
Slacken the vigour of his Muscles strong; \n
Then to the Mothers brest her softly move, \n
Which while she drain'd of Milk she fill'd with Love: \n
But as with riper Years her Virtue grew, \n
And ev'ry minute adds a Lustre new; \n
When with meridian height her Beauty shin'd, \n
And thorough that sparkled her fairer Mind; \n
When She with Smiles serene and Words discreet \n
His hidden Soul at ev'ry turn could meet; \n
Then might y' ha' daily his Affection spy'd, \n
Doubling that knot which Destiny had ty'd: \n
While they by sence, not knowing, comprehend \n
How on each other both their Fates depend. \n
With her each day the pleasing Hours he shares, \n
And at her Aspect calms her growing Cares; \n
Or with a Grandsire's joy her Children sees \n
Hanging about her neck or at his knees. \n
Hold fast dear Infants, hold them both or none; \n
This will not stay when once the other's gone. \n
A silent fire now wasts those Limbs of Wax, \n
And him with his tortur'd Image racks. \n
So the Flowr with'ring which the Garden crown'd, \n
The sad Root pines in secret under ground. \n
Each Groan he doubled and each Sigh he sigh'd, \n
Repeated over to the restless Night. \n
No trembling String compos'd to numbers new, \n
Answers the touch in Notes more sad more true. \n
She lest He grieve hides what She can her pains, \n
And He to lessen hers his Sorrow feigns: \n
Yet both perceiv'd, yet both conceal'd their Skills, \n
And so diminishing increast their ills: \n
That whether by each others grief they fell, \n
Or on their own redoubled, none can tell. \n
And now Eliza's purple Locks were shorn, \n
Where she so long her Fathers fate had worn: \n
And frequent lightning to her Soul that flyes, \n
Devides the Air, and opens all the Skyes: \n
And now his Life, suspended by her breath, \n
Ran out impetuously to hasting Death. \n
Like polish'd Mirrours, so his steely Brest \n
Had ev'ry figure of her woes exprest; \n
And with the damp of her last Gasps obscur'd, \n
Had drawn such staines as were not to be cur'd. \n
Fate could not either reach with single stroke, \n
But the dear Image fled the Mirrour broke. \n
Who now shall tell us more of mournful Swans, \n
Of Halcyons kind, or bleeding Pelicans? \n
No downy breast did ere so gently beat, \n
Or fan with airy plumes so soft an heat. \n
For he no duty by his height excus'd, \n
Nor though a Prince to be a Man refus'd: \n
But rather then in his Eliza's pain \n
Not love, not grieve, would neither live nor reign. \n
And in himself so oft immortal try'd, \n
Yet in compassion of another dy'd. \n
So have I seen a Vine, whose lasting Age \n
Of many a Winter hath surviv'd the rage. \n
Under whose shady tent Men ev'ry year \n
At its rich bloods expence their Sorrows chear, \n
If some dear branch where it extends its life \n
Chance to be prun'd by an untimely knife, \n
The Parent-Tree unto the Grief succeeds, \n
And through the Wound its vital humour bleeds; \n
Trickling in watry drops, whose flowing shape \n
Weeps that it falls ere fix'd into a Grape. \n
So the dry Stock, no more that spreading Vine, \n
Frustrates the Autumn and the hopes of Wine. \n
A secret Cause does sure those Signs ordain \n
Fore boding Princes falls, and seldom vain. \n
Whether some Kinder Pow'rs, that wish us well, \n
What they above cannot prevent, foretell; \n
Or the great World do by consent presage, \n
As hollow Seas with future Tempests rage: \n
Or rather Heav'n, which us so long fore sees, \n
Their fun'rals celebrate while it decrees. \n
But never yet was any humane Fate \n
By nature solemniz'd with so much state. \n
He unconcern'd the dreadful passage crost; \n
But oh what pangs that Death did Nature cost! \n
First the great Thunder was shot off, and sent \n
The Signal from the starry Battlement. \n
The Winds receive it, and its force out-do, \n
As practising how they could thunder too: \n
Out of the Binders Hand the Sheaves they tore, \n
And thrash'd the Harvest in the airy floore; \n
Or of huge Trees, whose growth with his did rise, \n
The deep foundations open'd to the Skyes. \n
Then heavy Showres the winged Tempests dead, \n
And pour the Deluge ore the Chaos head. \n
The Race of warlike Horses at his Tomb \n
Offer themselves in many an Hecatomb; \n
With pensive head towards the ground they fall, \n
And helpless languish at the tainted Stall. \n
Numbers of Men decrease with pains unknown, \n
And hasten not to see his Death their own. \n
Such Tortures all the Elements unfix'd, \n
Troubled to part where so exactly mix'd. \n
And as through Air his wasting Spirits flow'd, \n
The Universe labour'd beneath their load. \n
Nature it seem'd with him would Nature vye; \n
He with Eliza, It with him would dye. \n
He without noise still travell'd to his End, \n
As silent Suns to meet the Night descend. \n
The Stars that for him fought had only pow'r \n
Left to determine now his fatal Hour, \n
Which, since they might not hinder, yet they cast \n
To chuse it worthy of his Glories past. \n
No part of time but bore his mark away \n
Of honour; all the Year was Cromwell's day \n
But this, of all the most auspicious found, \n
Twice had in open field him Victor crown'd \n
When up the armed Mountains of Dunbar \n
He march'd, and through deep Severn ending war. \n
What day should him eternize but the same \n
That had before immortaliz'd his Name? \n
That so who ere would at his Death have joy'd, \n
In their own Griefs might find themselves imploy'd; \n
But those that sadly his departure griev'd, \n
Yet joy'd remembring what he once atcheiv'd. \n
And the last minute his victorious Ghost \n
Gave chase to Ligny on the Belgick Coast. \n
Here ended all his mortal toyles: He lay'd \n
And slept in Peace under the Lawrel Shade. \n
O Cromwell, Heavens Favourite! To none \n
Have such high honours from above been shown: \n
For whom the Elements we Mourners see, \n
And Heav'n it self would the great Herald be; \n
Which with more Care set forth his Obsequies \n
Then those of Moses hid from humane Eyes; \n
As jealous only here lest all be less, \n
That we could to his Memory express. \n
Then let us to our course of Mourning keep: \n
Where Heaven leads, 'tis Piety to weep. \n
Stand back ye Seas, and shrunk beneath the vail \n
Of your Abysse, with cover'd Head bewail \n
Your Monarch: We demand not your supplies \n
To compass in our Isle; our Tears suffice; \n
Since him away the dismal Tempest rent, \n
Who once more joyn'd us to the Continent; \n
Who planted England on the Flandrick shoar, \n
And stretch'd our frontire to the Indian Ore; \n
Whose greater Truths obscure the Fables old, \n
Whether of British Saints or Worthy's told; \n
And in a valour less'ning Arthur's deeds, \n
For Holyness the Confessor exceeds. \n
He first put Armes into Religions hand, \n
And tim'rous Conscience unto Courage man'd: \n
The Souldier taught that inward Mail to wear, \n
And fearing God how they should nothing fear. \n
Those Strokes he said will pierce through all below \n
Where those that strike from Heaven fetch their Blow. \n
Note: The remainder is supplied from Ms Eng.poet.d.49 \n
Astonish'd armyes did their flight prepare: \n
And Cityes strong were stormed by his prayer. \n
Of that for ever Prestons field shall tell \n
The Story, and impregnable Clonmell. \n
And where the sandy mountain Fenwick scald \n
The Sea between yet henee his pray'r prevail'd. \n
What man was ever so in Heav'n obey'd \n
Since the commanded Sun ore Gibeon stayd. \n
In all his warrs needs must he triumph, when \n
He conquer'd God still ere he fought with men. \n
Hence though in battle none so brave or fierce \n
Yet him the adverse steel could never pierce: \n
Pitty it seem'd to hurt him more that felt \n
Each wound himself which he to others delt, \n
Danger it self refusing to offend \n
So loose an enemy so fast a freind. \n
Friendship that sacred versue long das claime \n
The first foundation of his house and name. \n
But within one its narrow limitts fall \n
His tendernesse extended unto all: \n
And that deep soule through every chanell flows \n
Where kindly nature loves it self to lose. \n
More strong affections never reason serv'd \n
Yet still affected most what best deservd. \n
If he Eliza lov'd to that degree \n
(Though who more worstly to be lov'd then she) \n
If so indulgent to his own, how deare \n
To him the children of the Highest were? \n
For her he once did natures tribute pay: \n
For these his life adventur'd every day. \n
And it would be found could we his thoughts have \n
Their griefs struck deepest if Eliza's last. \n
What prudence more then humane did he need \n
To keep so deare, so diff'ring mindes agreed? \n
The worser sort as conscious of their ill, \n
Lye weak and easy to the rulers will: \n
But to the good (too many or too few). \n
All law is uselesse all reward is due. \n
Oh ill advis'd if not for love for shame. \n
Spare yet your own if you neglect his fame. \n
Least others dare to think your reale a maske \n
And you to govern only Heavens taske. \n
Valour, Religion, Friendship, Prudence dy'd \n
At once with him and all that's good beside: \n
And rue deaths refuse natures dreg's confin'd \n
To loathsome life Alas are left behinde: \n
Where we (so once we us'd) shall now no more \n
To fetch day presse about his chamber door; \n
From which he issu'd with that awfull state \n
It seem'd Mars broke through Janus double gate: \n
Yet alwayes temper'd with an Aire so mild \n
No Aprill suns that ere so gently smil'd: \n
No more shall heare that powerfull language charm. \n
Whose force oft spar'd the labour of his arm: \n
No more shall follow where he spent the dayes \n
In warres in counsell, or in pray'r, and praise, \n
Whose meanest acts he would himself advance \n
As ungirt David to the Arks did dance. \n
All All is gone of ours or his delight \n
In horses fierce wild deer or armour bright. \n
Francisca faire can nothing now but weep \n
Nor with soft notes shall sing his cares asleep. \n
I saw him dead, a leaden slumber lyes \n
And mortall sleep over those wakefull eys: \n
Those gentle Rayes under the lidds were fled \n
Which through his lookes that piercing sweetnesse she \n
That port which so Majestique was and strong, \n
Loose and depriv'd of vigour stretch'd along: \n
All wither'd, all discolour'd, pale and wan, \n
How much another thing, no more thatman? \n
Oh humane glory vaine, Oh death, Oh wings, \n
Oh worthlesse worth. Oh transitory things. \n
Yet dwelt that greatnesse in his shape decay'd \n
That still though dead greater than death he lay'd. \n
And in his alter'd face you something faigne \n
That threatens death he yet will live againe. \n
Not much unlike the saired Oake which shoots \n
To heav'n its branches and through earth its roots: \n
Whose spacious boughs are hung with Trophees row \n
And honour'd wreaths have oft the Victour crown \n
When angry Jove darts lightning through the Aire \n
At mortalls sins, nor his own plant will spare \n
(It groanes and bruses all below that stood \n
So many yeares the shelter of the wood) \n
The tree ere while foreshorten'd to our view \n
When foln shews taller yet then as it grew. \n
So shall his praise to after times increase \n
When truth shall be allow'd and faction cease. \n
And his own shadow with him fall. The Eye \n
Detracts from objects then it selfe more high: \n
But when death takes them from that envy'd seate \n
Seing how little we confesse how greate. \n
Thee many ages hence in martiall verse \n
Shall th' English souldier ere he charge rehearse: \n
Singing of thee influme themselves to fight \n
And with the name of Cromwell armyes fright. \n
As long as rivers to the seas shall runne. \n
As long as Cynthia shall relieve the sunne, \n
While staggs shall fly unto the forests thick, \n
While sheep delight the grassy downs to pick, \n
As long as future time succeeds the past, \n
Always thy honour, praise and name shall last. \n
Thou in a pitch how farre, beyond the sphere \n
Of humane glory towr'st, and raigning there \n
Despoyld of mortall robes, in seas of cliyse \n
Plunging dost bathe, and tread the bright Abysse: \n
There thy greate soule yet once a world das see \n
Spacious enough and pure enough for thee. \n
How soon thou Moses hast and Josua found \n
And David for the Sword, and harpe renown'd? \n
How streight canst to each happy Mansion goe? \n
(Farr Better known above then here below) \n
And in those joyes dost spend the endlesse day \n
Which in expressing we our selves betray. \n
For we since thou art gone with heavy doome \n
Wander like ghosts about thy loved tombe: \n
And lost in tears have neither sight nor minde \n
To guide us upward through this Region blinde \n
Since thou art gone who best that way could'st fearn \n
Onely our sighs perhaps may thither reach. \n
And Richard yet where his great Parent led \n
Beats on the rugged track: He vertue dead \n
Revives, and by his milder beams assures; \n
And yet how much of them his griefe obscures? \n
He as his rather long was kept from sight \n
In private to be view'd by better light: \n
But open'd once, what splendour dos he throw \n
A Cromwell in an houre a Prince will grow. \n
How he becomes that seat, how strongly streins \n
How gently winds at once the ruling Reins? \n
Heav'n to this choise prepar'd a Diadem \n
Richer then any Eastern silk or gemme: \n
A pearly rainbow; where the Sun inchas'd \n
His brows like an Imperiall Jewell grac'd. \n
We find already what those Omens mean. \n
Earth nere more glad, nor Heaven more serene: \n
Cease now our griefs, Calme peace succeeds a war \n
Rainbows to storms, Richard to Oliver. \n
Tempt not his clemency to try his pow'r \n
He threats no Deluge, yet fore tells a showre. \n<|endoftext|>

Me the summertime displeases, \n
For its sun is scorching hot; \n
Autumn brings such dire diseases \n
That perforce I like it not; \n
As for biting winter, oh! \n
How I hate its ice and snow! \n
"But, thrice welcome, kindly spring, \n
With the myriad gifts you bring! \n
Not too hot nor yet too cold, \n
Graciously your charms unfold-- \n
Oh, your days are like the dreaming \n
Of those nights which love beseems, \n
And your nights have all the seeming \n
Of those days of golden dreams! \n
Heaven smiles down on earth, and then \n
Earth smiles up to heaven again!" \n<|endoftext|>
poem \n
In the morning, when it was raining, \n
Then the birds were hectic and loudy; \n
Through all the reign is fall's entertaining; \n
Their singing was erratic and full of disorder: \n
They did not remember the summer blue \n
Or the orange of June. They did not think at all \n
Of the great red and bursting ball \n
Of the kingly sun's terror and tempest, blazing, \n
Once the slanting rain threw over all \n
The colorless curtains of the ceaseless spontaneous fall. \n<|endoftext|>
poem \n
And if it snowed and snow covered the drive \n
he took a spade and tossed it to one side. \n
And always tucked his daughter up at night \n
And slippered her the one time that she lied. \n
And every week he tipped up half his wage. \n
And what he didn't spend each week he saved. \n
And praised his wife for every meal she made. \n
And once, for laughing, punched her in the face. \n
And for his mum he hired a private nurse. \n
And every Sunday taxied her to church. \n
And he blubbed when she went from bad to worse. \n
And twice he lifted ten quid from her purse. \n
Here's how they rated him when they looked back: \n
sometimes he did this, sometimes he did that. \n<|endoftext|>
poem \n
Hate is only one of many responses \n
true, hurt and hate go hand in hand \n
but why be afraid of hate, it is only there \n
think of filth, is it really awesome \n
neither is hate \n
don't be shy of unkindness, either \n
it's cleansing and allows you to be direct \n
like an arrow that feels something \n
out and out meanness, too, lets love breathe \n
you don't have to fight off getting in too deep \n
you can always get out if you're not too scared \n
an ounce of prevention's \n
enough to poison the heart \n
don't think of others \n
until you have thought of yourself, are true \n
all of these things, if you feel them \n
will be graced by a certain reluctance \n
and turn into gold \n
if felt by me, will be smilingly deflected \n
by your mysterious concern \n<|endoftext|>
poem \n
While crowds of princes your deserts proclaim, \n
Proud in their number to enrol your name; \n
While emperors to you commit their cause, \n
And Anna's praises crown the vast applause; \n
Accept, great leader, what the Muse recites, \n
That in ambitious verse attempts your fights. \n
Fir'd and transported with a theme so new, \n
Ten thousand wonders opening to my view \n
Shine forth at once; sieges and storms appear, \n
And wars and conquests fill the' important year: \n
Rivers of blood I see, and hills of slain, \n
And Iliad rising out of one campaign. \n
The haughty Gaul beheld, with towering pride, \n
His ancient bounds enlarg'd on every side; \n
Pyrene's lofty barriers were subdued, \n
And in the midst of his wide empire stood; \n
Ausonia's states, the victor to restrain, \n
Opposed their Alps and Apennines in vain, \n
Nor found themselves, with strength of rocks immur'd, \n
Behind their everlasting hills secur'd; \n
The rising Danube its long race began, \n
And half its course through the new conquests ran; \n
Amaz'd and anxious for her soverign's fates, \n
Germania trembled through a hundred states; \n
Great Leopold himself was seiz'd with fear; \n
He gaz'd around, but saw no succour near; \n
He gaz'd, and half-abandon'd to despair. \n
His hopes on heaven, and confidence in pray; \n
To Britain's queen the nations turn their eyes, \n
On her resolves the western world relies, \n
Confiding still, amidst its dire alarms, \n
In Anna's conncils, and in Churchill's arms. \n
Thrice happy Britain, from the kingdoms rent, \n
To fit the guardian of the continent! \n
That sees her bravest son advanc'd so high, \n
And flourishing so near her prince's eye; \n
Thy favourites grow not up by fortune's sport, \n
Or from the crimes or follies of a court; \n
On the firm basis of desert they rise, \n
From long-try'd faith and friendship's holy tyes: \n
Their soverign's well-distinguish'd smiles they share, \n
Her ornaments in peace, her strength in war; \n
The nation thanks them with a public voice, \n
By showers of blessings heaven approves their choice; \n
Envy itself is dumb, in wonder lost, \n
And factions strive who shall applaud them most. \n
Soon as soft vernal breezes warm the sky, \n
Britannia's colours in the zephyrs fly; \n
Her chief already has his march begun, \n
Crossing the provinces himself had won, \n
Till the Moselle, appearing from afar, \n
Retards the progress of the moving war. \n
Delightful stream, had nature bid her fall \n
In distant climes far from the perjur'd Gaul; \n
But now a purchase to the sword she lies; \n
Her harvests for uncertain owners rise, \n
Each vineyard doubtful of its master grows, \n
And to the victor's bowl each vintage flows. \n
The discontented shades of slaughter'd hosts, \n
That wander'd on her banks, her heroes ghosts \n
Hop'd, when they saw Britannia's arms appear, \n
The vengeance due to their great deaths was near. \n
Our godlike leader, ere the stream he past, \n
The mighty scheme of all his labours cast, \n
Forming the wondrous year within his thought; \n
His bosom glow'd with battles yet unfought. \n
The long laborious march he first surveys, \n
And joins the distant Danube to the Maese, \n
Between whose floods such pathless forests grow, \n
Such mountains rise, so many rivers flow: \n
The toil looks lovely in the hero's eyes, \n
And danger serves but to enhance the prize. \n
Big with the fate of Europe, he renews \n
His dreadful course, and the proud foe pursues! \n
Infected by the burning Scorpion's heat, \n
the sultry gales round his chas'd temples beat, \n
Till on the borders of the Maine he finds \n
Defensive shadows, and refreshing winds. \n
Our British youth, with in-born freedom bold, \n
Unnumber'd scenes of servitude behold, \n
Nations of slaves, with tyranny debas'd, \n
(Their maker's image more than half defac'd) \n
Hourly instructed, as they urge their toil, \n
To prize their queen, and love their native soil. \n
Still to the rising sun they take their way \n
Through clouds of dust, and gain upon the day. \n
When now the Neckar on its friendly coast \n
With cooling streams revives the fainting host, \n
That chearfully his labours past forgets, \n
The mid-night watches, and the noon-day heats. \n
O'er prostrate towns and palaces they pass \n
(Now cover'd o'er with woods, and hid in grass), \n
Breathing revenge; whilst anger and disdain \n
Fire every breast, and boil in every vein: \n
Here shatter'd walls, like broken rocks, from far \n
Rise up in hideous views, the guilt of war, \n
Whilst here the vine o'er hills of ruin climbs, \n
Industrious to conceal great Bourbon's crimes. \n
At length the fame of England's hero drew \n
Eugenio to the glorious interview. \n
Great souls by instinct to each other turn, \n
Demand alliance, and in friendship burn: \n
A sudden friendship, while with stretch'd-out rays \n
They meet each other, mingling blaze with blaze, \n
Polish'd in courts, and harden'd in the field, \n
Renown'd for conquest, and in council skill'd, \n
Their courage dwells not in a troubled flood \n
Of mounting spirits, and fermenting blood; \n
Lodg'd in the soul, with virtue over-rul'd, \n
Inflam'd by reason, and by reason cool'd, \n
In hours of peace content to be unknown, \n
And only in the field of battle shown: \n
To souls like these, in mutual fiendship join'd, \n
Heaven dares intrust the cause of human-kind. \n
Britannia's graceful sons appear in arms, \n
Her harrass'd troops the hero's presence warms, \n
Whilst the high hills and rivers all around \n
With thundering peals of British shouts resound: \n
Doubling their speed, they march with fresh delight, \n
Eager for glory, and require the fight. \n
So the stanch hound the trembling deer pursues, \n
And smells his footsteps in the tainted dews, \n
The tedious track unraveling by degrees: \n
But when the scent comes warm in every breeze, \n
Fir'd at the near approach he shoots away \n
On his full stretch, and bears upon his prey. \n
The march concludes, the various realms are past; \n
Th' immortal Schellenberg appears at last: \n
Like hills th' aspiring ramparts rise on high, \n
Like valley's at their feet the trenches lie; \n
Batteries on batteries guard each fatal pass, \n
Threatening destruction; rows of hollow brass, \n
Tube behind tube, the dreadful entrance keep, \n
Whilst in thier wombs ten thousand thunders sleep, \n
Great Churchill owns, charm'd with the glorious sight, \n
His march o'er-paid by such a promis'd fight. \n
The western sun now shot a feeble ray, \n
And faintly scatter'd the remains of day: \n
Ev'ning approach'd; but oh what host of foes \n
Were never to behold that evening close! \n
Thickening their ranks, and wedg'd in firm array, \n
The close-compacted Britons win their way; \n
In vain the cannon their throng'd war defac'd \n
With tracts of death, and laid the battle waste; \n
Still pressing forward to the fight, they broke \n
Through flames of sulphur, and a night of smoke, \n
Till slaughter'd legions fill'd the trench below, \n
And bore their fierce avengers to the foe. \n
High on the works the mingling hosts engage; \n
The battle, kindled into tenfold rage, \n
With showers of bullets and with storms of fire \n
Burns in full fury; heaps on heaps expire, \n
Nations with nations mix'd confus'dly die, \n
And lsot in one promiscuous carnage lie. \n
How many generous Britons meet their doom, \n
New to the field, and heroes in the bloom! \n
Th' illustrious youghts, that left their native shore \n
To march where Britons never march'd before \n
(O fatal love of fame! O glorious heat \n
Only destructive to the brave and great!) \n
After such toils o'ercome, such dangers past, \n
Stretch'd on Bavarian ramparts breathe their last. \n
But hold, my Muse, may no complaints appear \n
Nor blot the day with an ungrateful tear: \n
While Marlborough lives, Britannia's stars dispense \n
A friendly light, and shine in innocence. \n
Plunging through seas of blood his fiery steed \n
Where-e'er his friends retire, or foes succeed; \n
Those he supports, these drives to sudden flight, \n
And turns the various fortune of the fight. \n
Forbear, great man, renown'd in arms, forbear \n
To Brave the thickest terrors of the war, \n
Nor hazard thus, confus'd in crowds of foes, \n
Britannia's safety, and the world's repose; \n
Let nations anxious for thy life abate \n
This scorn of danger, and contempt of fate: \n
Thou liv'st not for thyself; thy Queen demands \n
Conquest and peace from thy victorious hands; \n
Kingdoms and empires in thy fortunes join, \n
And Europe's destiny depends on thine. \n
At length the long-disputed pass they gain \n
By crowded armies fortify'd in vain; \n
The war breaks in, the fierce Bavarians yield, \n
And see their camp with British legions fill'd. \n
So Belgian mounds bear on their shatter'd sides \n
The sea's whole weight increas'd with swelling tides; \n
But if the rushing wave a passage finds, \n
Enrag'd by watery moons, and warring winds, \n
The trembling peasant sees his country round \n
Cover'd with tempests, and in oceans drown'd. \n
The few surviving foes disperst in flight, \n
(Refuse of swords,a nd gleanings of a fight) \n
In every rustling wind the victor hear, \n
And Marlborough's form in every shadow fear, \n
Till the dark cope of night with kind embrace \n
Befriends the rout, and covers their disgrace. \n
To Donavert, with unresisted force, \n
The gay victorious army bends its course. \n
The growth of meadows, and the pride of fields, \n
Whatever spoils Bavaria's summer yields \n
(The Danube's great increase), Britannia shares, \n
The food of armies and support of wars: \n
With magazines of death, destructive balls, \n
And cannon doom'd to batter Landau's walls, \n
The victor finds each hidden cavern stor'd, \n
And turns their fury on their guilty Lord. \n
Deluded prince! how is thy greatness crost, \n
And all the gaudy dream of empire lost, \n
That proudly set thee on a fancy'd throne, \n
And made imaginary realms thy own! \n
Thy troops, that now behind the Danube join, \n
Shall shortly seek for shelter from the Rhine, \n
Nor find it there! Surrounded with alarms, \n
Thou hop'st the assistance fo the Gallic arms; \n
The Gallic arms in safety shall advance, \n
And crowd thy standards with the power of France, \n
While, to exalt thy doom, th' aspiring Gaul \n
Shares thy destruction, and adorns thy fall. \n
Unbounded courage and compassion join'd, \n
Tempering each other in the victor's mind, \n
Alternately proclaim him good and great, \n
And make the Hero and the Man compleat, \n
Long did he strive th' obdurate foe to gain \n
By proffer'd grace, but long he strove in vain; \n
Till, fir'd at length, he thinks it vain to spare \n
His rising wrath, and gives a loose to war. \n
In vengeance rous'd, the soldier fills his hand \n
With sword and fire, and ravages the land, \n
A thousand villages to ashes turns, \n
In crackling flames a thousand harvests burns. \n
To the thick woods the wolly flocks retreat, \n
And mixt with bellowing herds confus'dly bleat: \n
Their trembling lofds the common shade partake, \n
And cries of infants sound in every brake: \n
The listening soldier fixt in sorrow stands, \n
Loth to obey his leader's just commands: \n
The leader grieves, by generous pity sway'd, \n
To see his just commands so well obey'd. \n
But now the trumpet terrible from far \n
In shriller clangors animates the war; \n
Confederate drums in fuller concert beat, \n
And echoing hills the loud alarm repeat: \n
Gallia's proud standards, to Bavaria's join'd, \n
Unfurl their gilded lilies in the wind; \n
the daring prince his blasted hopes renews, \n
And, while the thick embattled host he views \n
Stretched out in deep array, and dreadful length, \n
His hearts dilates, and glories in his strength. \n
The fatal day its mighty course began, \n
That the griev'd world had long desir'd in vain; \n
States that their new captivity bemoan'd, \n
Armies of martyrs that in exile groan'd, \n
Sighs from the depth of gloomy dungeons heard, \n
And prayers in bitterness of soul preferr'd, \n
Europe's loud cries, that Providence assail'd, \n
And Anna's ardent vows at length prevail'd; \n
The day was come when heaven design'd to show \n
His care and conduct of the world below. \n
Behold in awful march and dread array \n
The long extended squadrons shape thier way! \n
Death, in approaching terrible, imparts \n
An anxious horror to the bravest hearts; \n
Yet do their beating breasts demand the strife, \n
And thirst of glory quells the love of life. \n
No vulgar fears can British minds control: \n
Heat of revenge, and noble pride of soul, \n
O'erlook the foe, advantag'd by his post, \n
Lessen his nmbers,a nd contract his host; \n
Though fens and floods possest the middle space, \n
That unprovok'd they would have fear'd to pass; \n
Nor fens nor floods can stop Britannia's bands, \n
When her proud foe rang'd on their borders stands. \n
But O, my Muse, what numbers wilt thou find \n
To sing the furious troops in battle join'd! \n
Methinks I hear the drums tumultuous sound \n
The victor's shouts and dying groans confound, \n
The dreadful burst of cannon rend the skies, \n
And all the thunder of the battle rise. \n
'Twas then great Marlborough's mighty soul was prov'd, \n
That, in the shock of charging hosts unmov'd, \n
Amidst confusion, horror, and despair, \n
Examin'd all the dreadful scenes of war: \n
In peaceful thought the field of death survey'd, \n
To fainting squadrons sent the timely aid, \n
Inspir'd repuls'd battalions to engage, \n
And taught the doubtful battle where to rage. \n
So when an angel by divine command \n
With rising tempests shaks a guilty land, \n
Such as of late o'er pale Britannia past, \n
Calm and serene he drives the furious blast; \n
And, pleas'd th' Almighty's orders to perform, \n
Rides in the whirlwind, and directs the storm. \n
But see the haughty houshold troops advance! \n
The dread of Europe, and the pride of France. \n
The war's whole art each private soldier knows, \n
And with a General's love of conquest glows; \n
Proudly he marches on, and void of fear \n
Laughs at the shaking of the British spear: \n
Vain insolence! with native freedom brave, \n
The meanest Briton scorns the highest slave; \n
Contempt and fury fire their souls by turns, \n
Each nation's glory in each warrior burns: \n
Each fights, as in his arm th' important day \n
And all the fate of his great monarch lay: \n
A thousand glorious actions, that might claim \n
Truimphant laurels, and immortal fame, \n
Confus'd in crouds of glorious actions lie, \n
And troops of heroes undistinguish'd die. \n
O Dormer, how can I behold thy fate, \n
And not the wonders of thy youth relate! \n
How can I see the gay, the brave, the young, \n
Fall in the cloud of war, and lie usung! \n
In joys of conquest he resigns his breath, \n
And, fill'd with England's glory, smiles in death. \n
The rout begins, the Gallic squadrons run, \n
Compell'd in crouds to meet the fate they shun; \n
Thousands of fiery steeds with wounds transfix'd, \n
Floatting in gore, with their dead masters mixt, \n
'Midst heaps of spears and standards driven around, \n
Lie in the Danube's bloody whirl-pools drown'd \n
Troops of bold youths, born on the distant Soane, \n
Or sounding borders of the rapid Rhone, \n
Or where the Seine her flowery fields divides, \n
Or where the Loire through winding vineyards glides, \n
In heaps the rolling billows sweep away, \n
And into Scythian seas their bloated corps convey. \n
From Blenheim's towers the Gaul, with wild affright, \n
Beholds the various havock of the fight; \n
His waving banners, that so oft had stood \n
Planted in fields of death and streams of blood, \n
So wont the guarded enemy to reach, \n
And rise triumphant in the fatal breach, \n
Or pierce the broken foe's remotest lines, \n
The hardy veteran with tears resigns. \n
Unfortunate Tallard! Oh, who can name \n
The pangs of rage, of sorrow, and of shame, \n
That with mixt tumult in thy bosom swell'd, \n
When first thou saw'st thy bravest troops repell'd, \n
Thine only son pierc'd with a deadly wound, \n
Chok'd in his blood, and gasping on the ground, \n
Thyself in bondage by the victor kept! \n
The chief, the father, and the captive, wept. \n
An English Muse is touch'd with generous woe, \n
And in th'unhappy man forgets the foe! \n
Greatly distrest! they loud complaints forbear, \n
Blame not the turns of fate, and chance of war; \n
Give thy brave foes their due, nor blush to own \n
The fatal field by such great leaders won, \n
The field whence fam'd Eugenio bore away \n
Only the second honours of the day. \n
With floods of gore that from the vanquish'd fell \n
The marshes stagnate, and the rivers swell. \n
Mountains of slain lie heap'd upon the ground, \n
Or midst the roarings of the Danube drown'd; \n
Whole captive hosts the conqueror detains \n
In painful bondage, and inglorious chains; \n
Ev'n those who 'scape the fetters and the sword, \n
Nor seek the fortunes of a happier lord, \n
Their raging King dishonours, to compleat \n
Marlborough's great work, and finish the defeat. \n
From Memminghen's high domes, and Augsburg's walls, \n
The distant battle drives th' insulting Gauls; \n
Freed by the terror of the victor's name \n
The rescued States his great protection claim; \n
Whilst Ulme th' approach of her deliverer waits, \n
And longs to open her obsequious gates. \n
The hero's breast still swells with great designs, \n
In every thought the towering genius shines; \n
If to the foe his dreadful course he bends, \n
O'er the wide continent his march extends; \n
If sieges in his labouring thoughts are form'd \n
Camps are assaulted, and an army storm'd: \n
If to the sight of his active soul is bent \n
The fate of Europe turns on its event. \n
What distant land, what region, can afford \n
An action worthy his victorious sword? \n
Where will he next the flying Gaul defeat, \n
To make the series of his toils compleat? \n
Where the swoln Rhine rushing with all its force \n
Divides the hostile nations in its course, \n
While each contracts its bounds, or wider grows, \n
Enlarg'd or straighten'd as the river flows, \n
On Gallia's side a mighty bulwark stands, \n
That all the wide-extended plain commands; \n
Twice, since the war was kindled, has it try'd \n
The victor's rage, and twice has chang'd its side; \n
As oft whole armies, with the prize o'erjoy'd, \n
Have the long summer on its walls employ'd. \n
Hither our mighty chief his arms directs, \n
Hence future triumphs from the war expects; \n
And though the dog-star had its course begun, \n
Carries his arms still nearer to the sun: \n
Fixt on the glorious action, he forgets \n
The change of seasons, and increase of heats; \n
No toils are painful that can danger show, \n
No climes unlovely, that contain a foe. \n
The roving Gaul, to his own bounds restrain'd, \n
Learns to incamp within his native land, \n
But soon as the victorious host he spies, \n
From hill to hill, from stream to stream he flies: \n
Such dire impressions in his heart remain \n
Of Marlboroough's sword, and Hochsset's fatal plain: \n
In vain Britannia's mighty chief besets \n
Their shady coverts, and obscure retreats; \n
They fly the conqueror's approaching fame, \n
That bears the force of armies in his name. \n
Austria's young monarch, whose imperial sway \n
Sceptres and thrones are destin'd to obey, \n
Whose boasted ancertry so high extends, \n
That in the pagan gods his lineage ends, \n
Comes from afar, in gratitude to own \n
The geat supporter of his father's throne: \n
What tides of glory to his bosom ran, \n
Clasp'd in th' embrace of the godlike man! \n
How were his eyes with pleasing wonder fixt \n
To see such fire with so much sweetness mixt, \n
Such easy greatness, such a graceful port, \n
So turn'd and finish'd for the camp or court! \n
Achilles thus was form'd with every grace, \n
And Nireus shone but in the second place; \n
Thus the great father of almighty Rome \n
(Divinely flusht with an immortal bloom \n
That Cytherea's fragrant breath bestow'd) \n
In all the charms of his bright mother glow'd. \n
The royal youth by Marlborough's presence charm'd, \n
Taught by his counsels, by his actions warm'd, \n
On Landau with redoubled fury falls, \n
Discharges all his thunder on its walls, \n
O'er mines and caves of death provokes the fight, \n
And leans to conquer in the hero's fight. \n
The British chief, for mighty toils renown'd, \n
Increas'd in titles, and with conquests crown'd, \n
To Belgian coasts his tedious march renews, \n
And the long windings of the Rhine pursues, \n
Clearing its borders from usurping foes, \n
Amd blest by rescued nations as he goes. \n
Treves fears no more, freed from its dire alarms; \n
And Traerbach feels the terror of his arms: \n
Seated on rocks her proud foundations shake, \n
While Marlborough presses to the bold attack, \n
Plants all his batteries, bids his cannon roar, \n
And shows how Landau might have fall'n before. \n
Scar'd at his near approach, great Louis fears \n
Vengeance reserv'd for his declining years, \n
Forgets his thirst of universal sway, \n
And scarce can teach is subjects to obey; \n
His arms he finds on vain attempts employ'd, \n
Th' ambitious projects for his race destroy'd, \n
The works of ages sunk in one campaign, \n
And lives of millions sacrific'd in vain. \n
Such are th' effects of Anna's royal cares: \n
By her, Britannia, great in foreign wars, \n
Ranges through nations, wheresoe'er disjoin'd, \n
Without the wonted aid of sea and wind, \n
By her th' unfetter'd Ister's states are free, \n
And taste the sweets of English liberty: \n
But who can tell the joys of those that lie \n
Beneath the constant influence of her eye! \n
Whilst in diffusive showers her bounties fall \n
Like heaven's indulgence, and descend on all, \n
Secure the happy, succour the distrest, \n
Make every subject glad, and a whole people blest. \n
Thus would I fain Britannia's wars rehearse, \n
In the smooth records of a faithful verse; \n
That, if such numbers can o'er time prevail, \n
May tell posterity the wondrous tale. \n
When actions, unadorn'd, are faint and weak, \n
Cities and countries must be taught to speak; \n
Gods may descend in factions from the skies, \n
And rivers from their oozy beds arise; \n
Fiction may deck the truth wth spurious rays, \n
And round the hero cast a borrow'd blaze. \n
Marlborough's exploits appear divinely bright, \n
And proudly shine in their own native light; \n
Rais'd of themselves, their genuine charms they boast, \n

Lured by the wall, and drawn \n
To stare below the roof, \n
Where pigeons nest aloof \n
From prowling cats and men, \n
I count the sash and bar \n
Secured to granite stone, \n
And note the daylight gone, \n
Supper and silence near. \n
Close to the wall inside, \n
Immured, empty of love, \n
A man I have wondered of \n
Lies patient, vacant-eye. \n
A month and a day ago \n
He stopped his car and found \n
A girl on the darkening ground, \n
And killed her in the snow. \n
Beside his cell, I am told, \n
Hardy perennial bums \n
Complain till twilight comes \n
For hunger and for cold. \n
They hardly know of a day \n
That saw their hunger pass. \n
Bred to the dark, their flesh \n
Peacefully withers away. \n
The man who sits alone, \n
He is the one for wonder, \n
Who sways his fingers under \n
The cleanly shaven chin, \n
Who sees, in the shaving mirror \n
Pinned to the barren wall, \n
The uprooted ghost of all: \n
The simple, easy terror. \n
Caught between sky and earth, \n
Poor stupid animal, \n
Stripped naked to the wall, \n
He saw the blundered birth \n
Of daemons beyond sound. \n
Sick of the dark, he rose \n
For love, and now he goes \n
Back to the broken ground. \n
Now, as he grips the chain \n
And holds the wall, to bear \n
What no man ever bore, \n
He hears the bums complain; \n
But I mourn no soul but his, \n
Not even the bums who die, \n
Nor the homely girl whose cry \n
Crumbled his pleading kiss. \n<|endoftext|>
poem \n
How much better it seems now \n
than when it is finally done– \n
the unforgettable first line, \n
the cunning way the stanzas run. \n
The rhymes soft-spoken and suggestive \n
are barely audible at first, \n
an appetite not yet acknowledged \n
like the inkling of a thirst. \n
While gradually the form appears \n
as each line is coaxed aloud– \n
the architecture of a room \n
seen from the middle of a crowd. \n
The music that of common speech \n
but slanted so that each detail \n
sounds unexpected as a sharp \n
inserted in a simple scale. \n
No jumble box of imagery \n
dumped glumly in the reader's lap \n
or elegantly packaged junk \n
the unsuspecting must unwrap. \n
But words that could direct a friend \n
precisely to an unknown place, \n
those few unshakeable details \n
that no confusion can erase. \n
And the real subject left unspoken \n
but unmistakable to those \n
who don't expect a jungle parrot \n
in the black and white of prose. \n
How much better it seems now \n
than when it is finally written. \n
How hungrily one waits to feel \n
the bright lure seized, the old hook bitten. \n<|endoftext|>

It's so nice \n

poem \n
Waiting on Death Row \n
People coming in overalls \n
Taking me to the gas chamber \n
Scuffling of feet \n

Feeling everyone's heartbeat \n
The central control of the soul \n
Batons and retro-tons \n
Ingrown toenails \n
One time all around you \n
All round you, bump-bump \n
Save my air, save my air \n
My air, my air \n
Air, water, trees \n
Machines eating the night \n
Energy moving \n
Nuclear fires \n
Burning reactors on my gate \n
Fires of hell are burning \n
Come home \n

Can you say \n
That you say \n
That you really love this place? \n<|endoftext|>

poem \n
I can write the saddest poem of all tonight. \n
Write, for instance: "The night is full of stars, \n
and the stars, blue, shiver in the distance." \n
The night wind whirls in the sky and sings. \n
I can write the saddest poem of all tonight. \n
I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too. \n
On nights like this, I held her in my arms. \n
I kissed her so many times under the infinite sky. \n
She loved me, sometimes I loved her. \n
How could I not have loved her large, still eyes? \n
I can write the saddest poem of all tonight. \n
To think I don't have her. To feel that I've lost her. \n
To hear the immense night, more immense without her. \n
And the poem falls to the soul as dew to grass. \n
What does it matter that my love couldn't keep her. \n
The night is full of stars and she is not with me. \n
That's all. Far away, someone sings. Far away. \n
My soul is lost without her. \n
As if to bring her near, my eyes search for her. \n
My heart searches for her and she is not with me. \n
The same night that whitens the same trees. \n
We, we who were, we are the same no longer. \n
I no longer love her, true, but how much I loved her. \n
My voice searched the wind to touch her ear. \n
Someone else's. She will be someone else's. As she once \n
belonged to my kisses. \n
Her voice, her light body. Her infinite eyes. \n
I no longer love her, true, but perhaps I love her. \n
Love is so short and oblivion so long. \n
Because on nights like this I held her in my arms, \n
my soul is lost without her. \n
Although this may be the last pain she causes me, \n
and this may be the last poem I write for her. \n<|endoftext|>
poem \n
My left hand will live longer than my right. The rivers \n
of my palms tell me so. \n
Never argue with rivers. Never expect your lives to finish \n
at the same time. I think \n
praying, I think clapping is how hands mourn. I think \n
staying up and waiting \n
for paintings to sigh is science. In another dimension this \n
is exactly what's happening, \n
it's what they write grants about: the chromodynamics \n
of mournful Whistlers, \n
the audible sorrow and beta decay of Old Battersea Bridge. \n
I like the idea of different \n
theres and elsewheres, an Idaho known for bluegrass, \n
a Bronx where people talk \n
like violets smell. Perhaps I am somewhere patient, somehow \n
kind, perhaps in the nook \n
of a cousin universe I've never defiled or betrayed \n
anyone. Here I have \n
two hands and they are vanishing, the hollow of your back \n
to rest my cheek against, \n
your voice and little else but my assiduous fear to cherish. \n
My hands are webbed \n
like the wind-torn work of a spider, like they squeezed \n
something in the womb \n
but couldn't hang on. One of those other worlds \n
or a life I felt \n
passing through mine, or the ocean inside my mother's belly \n
she had to scream out. \n
Here, when I say I never want to be without you, \n
somewhere else I am saying \n
I never want to be without you again. And when I touch you \n
in each of the places we meet, \n
in all of the lives we are, it's with hands that are dying \n
and resurrected. \n
When I don't touch you it's a mistake in any life, \n
in each place and forever. \n<|endoftext|>
poem \n
My poem would eat nothing. \n
I tried giving it water \n
but it said no, \n
worrying me. \n
Day after day, \n
I held it up to the llight, \n
turning it over, \n
but it only pressed its lips \n
more tightly together. \n
It grew sullen, like a toad \n
through with being teased. \n
I offered it money, \n
my clothes, my car with a full tank. \n
But the poem stared at the floor. \n
Finally I cupped it in \n
my hands, and carried it gently \n
out into the soft air, into the \n
evening traffic, wondering how \n
to end things between us. \n
For now it had begun breathing, \n
putting on more and \n
more hard rings of flesh. \n
And the poem demanded the food, \n
it drank up all the water, \n
beat me and took my money, \n
tore the faded clothes \n
off my back, \n
said Shit, \n
and walked slowly away, \n
slicking its hair down. \n
Said it was going \n
over to your place. \n<|endoftext|>

poem \n
Sometimes the poem \n
doesn't want to come; \n
it hides from the poet \n
like a playful cat \n
who has run \n
under the house \n
& lurks among slugs, \n
roots, spiders' eyes, \n
ledge so long out of the sun \n
that it is dank \n
with the breath of the Troll King. \n
Sometimes the poem \n
darts away \n
like a coy lover \n
who is afraid of being possessed, \n
of feeling too much, \n
of losing his essential \n
loneliness-which he calls \n
freedom. \n
Sometimes the poem \n
can't requite \n
the poet's passion. \n
The poem is a dance \n
between poet & poem, \n
but sometimes the poem \n
just won't dance \n
and lurks on the sidelines \n
tapping its feet- \n
iambs, trochees- \n
out of step with the music \n
of your mariachi band. \n
If the poem won't come, \n
I say: sneak up on it. \n
Pretend you don't care. \n
Sit in your chair \n
reading Shakespeare, Neruda, \n
immortal Emily \n
and let yourself flow \n
into their music. \n
Go to the kitchen \n
and start peeling onions \n
for homemade sugo. \n
Before you know it, \n
the poem will be crying \n
as your ripe tomatoes \n
bubble away \n
with inspiration. \n
When the whole house is filled \n
with the tender tomato aroma, \n
start kneading the pasta. \n
As you rock \n
over the damp sensuous dough, \n
making it bend to your will, \n
as you make love to this manna \n
of flour and water, \n
the poem will get hungry \n
and come \n
just like a cat \n
coming home \n
when you least \n
expect her. \n<|endoftext|>

Old man in the crystal morning after snow, \n
Your throat swathed in a muffler, your bent \n
Figure building the snow man which is meant \n
For the grandchild's target, \n
do you know \n
This fat cartoon, his eyes pocked in with coal \n
Nears you each time your breath smokes the air, \n
Lewdly grinning out of a private nightmare? \n
He is the white cold shadow of your soul. \n
You build his comic head, you place his comic hat; \n
Old age is not so serious, and I \n
By the window sad and watchful as a cat, \n
Build to this poem of old age and of snow, \n
And weep: you are my snow man and I know \n
I near you, you near him, all of us must die. \n<|endoftext|>

poem \n
I see you drinking at a fountain with tiny \n
blue hands, no, your hands are not tiny \n
they are small, and the fountain is in France \n
where you wrote me that last letter and \n
I answered and never heard from you again. \n
you used to write insane poems about \n
ANGELS AND GOD, all in upper case, and you \n
knew famous artists and most of them \n
were your lovers, and I wrote back, it' all right, \n
go ahead, enter their lives, I' not jealous \n
because we' never met. we got close once in \n
New Orleans, one half block, but never met, never \n
touched. so you went with the famous and wrote \n
about the famous, and, of course, what you found out \n
is that the famous are worried about \n
their fame - not the beautiful young girl in bed \n
with them, who gives them that, and then awakens \n
in the morning to write upper case poems about \n
ANGELS AND GOD. we know God is dead, they' told \n
us, but listening to you I wasn' sure. maybe \n
it was the upper case. you were one of the \n
best female poets and I told the publishers, \n
editors, " her, print her, she' mad but she' \n
magic. there' no lie in her fire." I loved you \n
like a man loves a woman he never touches, only \n
writes to, keeps little photographs of. I would have \n
loved you more if I had sat in a small room rolling a \n
cigarette and listened to you piss in the bathroom, \n
but that didn' happen. your letters got sadder. \n
your lovers betrayed you. kid, I wrote back, all \n
lovers betray. it didn' help. you said \n
you had a crying bench and it was by a bridge and \n
the bridge was over a river and you sat on the crying \n
bench every night and wept for the lovers who had \n
hurt and forgotten you. I wrote back but never \n
heard again. a friend wrote me of your suicide \n
3 or 4 months after it happened. if I had met you \n
I would probably have been unfair to you or you \n
to me. it was best like this. \n<|endoftext|>

Three days after the first snowfall of season \n
The air is calm, but lots of hanging clouds. \n
Snow falls, but just few scattered flakes. \n
The sun is half-hiding behind passing clouds. \n
A squirrel lies by roadside with exposed belly. \n
This squirrel was killed last night, while crossing the road. \n
Few years, I traveled this road, back and forth \n
Many times, I was afraid that this squirrel might be struck dead. \n
The other day, I pushed my car break to a sudden stop. \n
This squirrel was standing in the middle of the road, \n
Too scared, it ran in circle, not sure of where to escape. \n
It escaped its death because of its best luck. \n
Last night, this squirrel was struck. \n
I feel sad and miss you much \n
Have my sympathy, my dear squirrel. \n

He lives in the outer parts never seen by high society. \n
Always hip on what the story is, he’s broke without a penny. \n
Filled with messages from the broken hearts, he knows their plight in the entirety. \n
Got the grip on every politic, he just wished there wasn’t any. \n
Robin Hood waiting for Marion, could it be that \n
all the good in the world’s is done. \n
It was everyone’s big wish we could find the shining sun. \n
I pray to God His staff and rod will guide us. \n
Lost forgotten is our man of arms, SYMPATHY FOR THE UNDERDOG. \n
He’s kicked and mocked and trampled on, empathy for the underdog. \n
He stands for Don Quixote’s song, SYMPATHY FOR THE UNDERDOG. \n
He hides in the forest deep with a rabbit amidst the wilds. \n
Gone away from all the world like ours to meditate upon it. \n
Filled with answers but shy he will keep till the moment is ripe and mild. \n
Every ear will turn and listen as He recites His lovely sonnets. \n
There he stood singing His passion’s song, could it be that \n
all the good has turned to wrong? \n
It was many days until a gong whence rang amongst this throng. \n

sympathy \n
Where is the voice in my head \n
If any help it wants to be \n
now would be the best \n
These hands which flawlessly curse me \n
perform a symphony of sympathy \n
a one man orchestra of confusion and heartbreak \n
Where is this trust I've heard so much about \n
but can't seem to find \n
And to the world in which I stay \n
don't hate me when I say \n
'This identical state of mind \n
from the glass we look through \n
can you locate the hopes of the citizens \n
you erase \n
You know our names and our faces \n
but could you take one look at a blooming blue rose \n
straight in the eye and call it ugly \n
Could you look at a hummingbird \n
and ask for its wings to cease it's beat \n

sympathy \n
Grief held me silent in my seat; \n
I neither moved nor smiled: \n
Joy held her silent at my feet, \n
My shining lily-child. \n
She raised her face and looked in mine; \n
She deemed herself denied; \n
The door was shut, there was no shine; \n
Poor she was left outside! \n
Once, twice, three times, with infant grace \n
Her lips my name did mould; \n
Her face was pulling at my face- \n
She was but ten months old. \n
I saw; the sight rebuked my sighs; \n
It made me think-Does God \n
Need help from his poor children's eyes \n
To ease him of his load? \n
Ah, if he did, how seldom then \n
The Father would be glad! \n
If comfort lay in the eyes of men, \n
He little comfort had! \n
We cry to him in evil case, \n
When comfort sore we lack; \n
And when we troubled seek his face, \n
Consoled he sends us back; \n
Nor waits for prayer to rise and climb- \n
He wakes the sleeping prayer; \n
He is our father all the time, \n
And servant everywhere. \n
I looked not up; foreboding hid \n
Kept down my heart the while; \n
'Twas he looked up; my Father did \n
Smile in my infant's smile. \n<|endoftext|>

sympathy \n
A person is called saint if he has kindness with all the sympathy \n
He can claim then only as direct descendent of almighty \n
Or Messiah, messenger or for that respect an angel \n
At every inch you must look ordinary but with different angle \n
I have known or heard about many of such figures \n
They have worked for the humanity and reassured \n
About the human misery and risk involved for apathy \n
What work is to be taken up or followed to gain His sympathy? \n
Each work is evaluated and appreciated by God \n
Many might have lost favor as their soul stands sold \n
They are burden and living animal on earth \n
At each stage they live on but with the fear of death \n
To work under such difficult situation is Herculean task \n
No one may opt for it or readily go and ask \n
Some of the great souls are easily picked on earth \n
God has always created such situation without any dearth \n
Such a kind of saints have prevailed in present time \n
For the rescue of mankind with their known and committed crimes \n
Hardly anybody can undertake such enterprise \n
It is much to relief and to our surprise \n
It proves God's existence \n
We feel and experience His presence \n
He is omni present and in every individual \n
Only we fail to understand Him and take very casual \n
If some one works on charity or any kind of human service \n
That may be counted as noble cause and looked upon very nice \n
All kinds of help will be rendered and efforts lauded \n
His or her presence will be taken with high esteem and applauded \n
It is not done to gain international fame \n
It may involve great work and full of blames \n
Little slackness may invite lots of criticism \n
As it isli9nked with the work of humanism \n
Thousands of hands are raised in your well being \n
Prayers and congregations are held to praise and sing \n
Preaching is done so as to spread the kind and love message \n
The sick and ill fated souls are shown the way with passage \n
The services of poor may be remembered very long \n
It is not only the care and help but to stay among \n
Not showing mere finger for any work to be done \n
The far reaching impact will never be undone \n
Some of the names may be remembered by all \n
As they have responded with charity and humanitarian call \n
Anybody could do it without any assistance \n
But it has made some difference with their presence \n<|endoftext|>

Work! Work! Work! And Reap! \n
Work! Work! Work! And Sleep! \n
Everyday most of we work \n
Some of us love to work \n
Some of us just want to rock \n
Some of us want to lie on a beach or take a walk \n
If we had our way, we could spend all day and talk \n
But work we all must \n
Or our lifestyles will go bust! \n
We may then have to readjust \n
To unacceptable standards of living in disgust \n
Work! Work! Work! And Reap! \n
Work! Work! Work! And Sleep! \n
We all have different professions \n
Some of us have silent confessions \n
We fancy someone at work with an obsession \n
Work is then fun with a passion until confusion \n
Work! Work! Work! And Reap! \n
Work! Work! Work! And Sleep! \n
There are jobs that are monotonous \n
The atmosphere is negatively outrageous \n
Nothing in the air signifies hilarious \n
Every single person is always very serious \n
Sometimes played at work \n
Is the kind of politics \n
That makes one quite sick \n
This is where the strong kick \n
Kick hardest the backside of the weak \n
But work we all must \n
Or our lifestyles will go bust! \n
As we find ourselves lost \n
And then try hard to readjust \n
So do we swallow? \n
Or is fighting back shallow \n
Will it leave in your pocket a dent that is hollow? \n
Or produce a scene labeled horror \n
Enough to leave you in tears of sorrow \n
I don't have all the answers \n
I know work is a living cancer \n
People at work ought to be a little nicer \n
Everyone needs to make a living including a dancer! \n

work \n
The Lord has work for all to do, prepared good works for me and you. \n
A work that is intended to Glorify, the One who on the cross had died. \n
Jesus’ work accomplished for all, man’s redemption from Adam’s fall. \n
Christ’s finished work for all of us, a work in which we place our trust. \n
And nothing can be added to, His work accomplished for me and you. \n
For salvation is a gift of Grace, secured when Jesus died in our place. \n
No righteous works on our part; it was all of Christ right from the start. \n
Christ’s finished work on that cross, alone is what saves sinners lost. \n
The work prepared for us you see, is to point others towards Eternity. \n
As God will use you in many ways, as you live out your earthly days. \n
God above can use most any skill, as it’s tempered by His loving will, \n
Pointing other men to Jesus Christ, as The Holy Spirit leads your life. \n
This work was prepared long before, anybody knew Christ was Lord. \n
An Eternal Plan by The Lord above, and centered on a cross of Love. \n
Where Christ Jesus paid the price, by offering Himself as a sacrifice. \n
For a body was prepared for Him, as the atonement for all of our sin. \n
Now for us the work to be done, is to lead all men to God’s Only Son. \n
What better work could there be, than in helping other people to see, \n
That The Lord Jesus died for us, and in Him we must place our trust, \n
So when all earthly labors cease, with Him we’ll have Eternal Peace. \n

work \n
I’m well aware that they are laying poems \n
out on slabs these days – dissecting them – \n
dropping their heart, their mind, their guts \n
into little dishes and putting their cells under \n
a microscope. They scrape under fingernails \n
for evidence and chart wounds, both long since \n
sustained and newly acquired, on a diagram for \n
future reference. They drain their blood and \n
pump them full of something they say will \n
preserve them, something as insanely unnatural \n
as the exercise itself, only to then abandon \n
them, alone, in the long dark night \n
as if they never existed. \n
My poems do not wish to be undressed \n
and undone, poked and prodded, severed \n
or sliced, only to be forgotten at the turning \n
of a page. They want to fly, burn, breath, rage \n
and urge from you the conversation we would \n
not otherwise have had. They want your \n
instinct, your humanity - understanding – \n
and not the scalpel or the thin white gloves \n
that keep us from actually touching. So, if I \n
say the horse was just a horse, that the colors \n
were randomly chosen or that I hung a moon \n
in the middle of a poem for no particular \n
reason at all, just let me have that – \n
but don’t believe me. \n

We struggle with it \n

Where in the hierarchical \n

Where is Justice \n

No, we all have bosses \n
and contemplate each day \n
where do my child-learned \n
ideals fit? \n
I will tell you; \n
in the Water Cooler Gossip Group. \n
There is where Justice is done \n
complaints are vented, \n
where equality before the H2O \n

How can \n
what I learned democracy is \n
be banned from my work space? \n
How can Fairness and Morality \n
be slaughtered like the lamb \n
in the hierarchy? \n
We have revolutions not because of the \n
ruling class \n

and felt \n
before the Water-Cooler Deity; \n
where \n
shock and awe \n
exist, \n
where plots and plans \n
from the latest \n
gossip-tidbit \n
to strategic strategies shared \n
among participants \n
who like soldiers and couriers \n
make sure to dispense \n
each bon mot and redemption \n
far and wide \n

Then shall I see it not too great, nor small, \n
To suit my spirit and to prove my powers; \n
Then shall I cheerful greet the labouring hours, \n
And cheerful turn, when the long shadows fall \n

Because I know for me my work is best. \n<|endoftext|>

“Bound to work” \n

Work speed was some slow still then she was working. \n

She was a worker in a factory. \n
Work provides food and medicine for her family. \n
So, she was bound to work in illness also. \n

How do you tackle your work each day? \n
Are you scared of the job you find? \n
Do you grapple the task that comes your way \n
With a confident, easy mind? \n
Do you stand right up to the work ahead \n
Or fearfully pause to view it? \n
Do you start to toil with a sense of dread? \n
Or feel that you're going to do it? \n
You can do as much as you think you can, \n
But you'll never accomplish more; \n
If you're afraid of yourself, young man, \n
There's little for you in store. \n
For failure comes from the inside first, \n
It's there if we only knew it, \n
And you can win, though you face the worst, \n
If you feel that you're going to do it. \n
Success! It's found in the soul of you, \n
And not in the realm of luck! \n
The world will furnish the work to do, \n
But you must provide the pluck. \n
You can do whatever you think you can, \n
It's all in the way you view it. \n
It's all in the start you make, young man: \n
You must feel that you're going to do it. \n
How do you tackle your work each day? \n
With confidence clear, or dread? \n
What to yourself do you stop and say \n
When a new task lies ahead? \n
What is the thought that is in your mind? \n
Is fear ever running through it? \n
If so, just tackle the next you find \n
By thinking you're going to do it. \n
--From "A Heap o' Linin'," by Edgar A. Guest \n
I tackle my terrible job each day \n
With a fear that is well defined; \n
And I grapple the task that comes my way \n
With no confidence in my mind. \n
I try to evade the work ahead, \n
As I fearfully pause to view it, \n
And I start to toil with a sense of dread, \n
And doubt that I'm going to do it. \n
I can't do as much as I think I can, \n
And I never accomplish more. \n
I am scared to death of myself, old man, \n
As I may have observed before. \n
I've read the proverbs of Charley Schwab, \n
Carnegie, and Marvin Hughitt; \n
But whenever I tackle a difficult job, \n
O gosh! I hate to do it! \n
I try to believe in my vaunted power \n
With that confident kind of bluff, \n
But somebody tells me The Conning Tower \n
Is nothing but awful stuff. \n
And I take up my impotent pen that night, \n
And idly and sadly chew it, \n
As I try to write something merry and bright, \n
And I know that I shall not do it. \n
And that's how I tackle my work each day-- \n
With terror and fear and dread-- \n
And all I can see is a long array \n
Of empty columns ahead. \n
And those are the thoughts that are in my mind, \n
And that's about all there's to it. \n
As long as there's work, of whatever kind, \n
I'm certain I cannot do it. \n<|endoftext|>

work \n
Do I read signs that aren't there \n
Is that look in your eye a wanting or a pity \n
Is your mind split in two like mine \n
Guess work \n
Make your move \n
Because I wont...... \n<|endoftext|>
work \n
Then a ploughman said, "Speak to us of Work." \n
And he answered, saying: \n
You work that you may keep pace with the earth and the soul of the earth. \n
For to be idle is to become a stranger unto the seasons, and to step out of life's procession, that marches in majesty and proud submission towards the infinite. \n
When you work you are a flute through whose heart the whispering of the hours turns to music. \n
Which of you would be a reed, dumb and silent, when all else sings together in unison? \n
Always you have been told that work is a curse and labour a misfortune. \n
But I say to you that when you work you fulfil a part of earth's furthest dream, assigned to you when that dream was born, \n
And in keeping yourself with labour you are in truth loving life, \n
And to love life through labour is to be intimate with life's inmost secret. \n
But if you in your pain call birth an affliction and the support of the flesh a curse written upon your brow, then I answer that naught but the sweat of your brow shall wash away that which is written. \n
You have been told also life is darkness, and in your weariness you echo what was said by the weary. \n
And I say that life is indeed darkness save when there is urge, \n
And all urge is blind save when there is knowledge, \n
And all knowledge is vain save when there is work, \n
And all work is empty save when there is love; \n
And when you work with love you bind yourself to yourself, and to one another, and to God. \n
And what is it to work with love? \n
It is to weave the cloth with threads drawn from your heart, even as if your beloved were to wear that cloth. \n
It is to build a house with affection, even as if your beloved were to dwell in that house. \n
It is to sow seeds with tenderness and reap the harvest with joy, even as if your beloved were to eat the fruit. \n
It is to charge all things you fashion with a breath of your own spirit, \n
And to know that all the blessed dead are standing about you and watching. \n
Often have I heard you say, as if speaking in sleep, "he who works in marble, and finds the shape of his own soul in the stone, is a nobler than he who ploughs the soil. \n
And he who seizes the rainbow to lay it on a cloth in the likeness of man, is more than he who makes the sandals for our feet." \n
But I say, not in sleep but in the over-wakefulness of noontide, that the wind speaks not more sweetly to the giant oaks than to the least of all the blades of grass; \n
And he alone is great who turns the voice of the wind into a song made sweeter by his own loving. \n
Work is love made visible. \n
And if you cannot work with love but only with distaste, it is better that you should leave your work and sit at the gate of the temple and take alms of those who work with joy. \n
For if you bake bread with indifference, you bake a bitter bread that feeds but half man's hunger. \n
And if you grudge the crushing of the grapes, your grudge distills a poison in the wine. \n
And if you sing though as angels, and love not the singing, you muffle man's ears to the voices of the day and the voices of the night. \n<|endoftext|>
work \n
Hammer closed the sale that day. \n
Your sweat man-profit of ways. \n
Work in the field, sun is hot. \n
Water boy, fast or maybe not. \n
Master wants more work today. \n
You have no real say. \n
What is the time of morn. \n
Sun down-fullmoon- work long. \n
Cant ever stop this pace. \n
Thought I was part of the human race. \n
More ships are comming ashore. \n
Work without pay-open door. \n
Man has found many ways. \n
Pet dogs and bones of may. \n

work \n
Work work and hard work \n
There is no substitute of hard work \n
Only by hard work you can earn money \n
And money is not a thing to believe \n
Money fetches good food \n
Virility beautiful wife and charity \n
And all above have no eternity. \n<|endoftext|>
thanks \n
When times are lean with nought to share \n
When love is hard to find \n
Where cold nights reign with cupboards bare \n
Then God is on the mind \n
But who gives praise when life is grand \n
When God has seen us through \n
Who’ve learned in truth to understand \n
That God remembers too \n
How oft we fail to thank the Lord \n
For all His kindness done \n
Through love He’ll turn His vengeful sword \n
In Christ His faithful Son \n
Give thanks to God for large and small \n
Give thanks for life on earth \n
From deep within or not at all \n
Give praise for all you’re worth \n
Worthy is God of all our praise \n
For all His wondrous deeds \n
Who serve The Truth in all their ways \n
May find they have no needs \n
Yet still the nations live in stress \n
Where harvest brings defeat \n
They need to turn so God can bless \n
With food for all to eat \n
Yet those who have can ill afford \n
With belly’s full to sit \n
We need to pray through Christ our Lord \n
We need to do our bit \n
For things can change as times before \n
When God held back the rain \n
For who can tell if sin once more \n
Won’t change our times again \n<|endoftext|>
thanks \n
You know how when there’s a disaster where a bunch of \n
people are killed and the one guy who survives thanks God? \n
I think that’s a pretty screwed up perspective on the situation. \n
I know he’s happy to be alive, but if anything, he should be \n
cursing God for letting everyone else perish. \n
Now, why did God save this one guy’s sorry ass? Because the \n
guy went to church and prayed? I’m sure some of those folks \n
who perished did that too. \n
I know what you’re going to say – that it’s all part of God’s \n
mysterious plan. What an ignorant explanation that is! \n
And it’s not even an explanation. \n
I suppose Hitler was part of God’s plan too? And what about \n
Michael Bolton? Was it God’s plan to make that talentless hack \n
a superstar? Now that I think of it, maybe it was God himself \n
who went out and bought up all those CDs in order to \n
artificially run Bolton up the charts. If that’s the case, then it’s \n
true that God has a very mysterious plan. But at least he has a \n
sense of humor. \n<|endoftext|>
thanks \n
Thank You, Lord, for simple things \n
That money just can’t buy: \n
Love, health, happiness \n
And the beauty of the sky. \n
Family, friends and gentle pets \n
Are blessings in disguise; \n
A mother who is wonderful, \n
A father who is wise. \n
Thank You for the basics: \n
Food, clothes, a home. \n
Also for the things unique \n
Like waves with white foam. \n
It’s not always the big things— \n
The noble and elite— \n
But at times, the simple things \n
That make life complete. \n<|endoftext|>

I asked Allah for strenght, that I might achieve I was so week, that i might learn humbly to obey.. I asked for health, that I might I might do better things... \n
I asked for riches, that I might be happy I was given poverty, that I might be wise... I ask for power, that I might have the praise of men \n

I asked for all things, that I might enjoy life I was given life, that I might enjoy all things.. \n

- * THANKS FOR THE MEMORIES * - \n
You used to send me little things \n
that brightened up my day. \n
You'd send a joke or poem \n
that you'd found along the way. \n
Or you'd send a little message \n
that you'd written just for me. \n
How I miss that little kindness, \n
that I no longer see. \n
But you, I'll ere remember \n
until my days are done \n
Because in my mind you'll always be \n
My friend-you're number one. \n
Thanks for the memories...... \n

thanks for being strength in my weakness \n
thanks for being hope in my despair \n

are cascading pike-peak thorns \n

all you can hear are crickets singing their dirges \n
when we call for ululation to heal the hurts \n
when the sun rises as it usually does, \n
and the cock crows at the hour it can; \n
when the apostolic minister rings the church bells \n
and the congregation begins to sing the 'martins', \n
hear it again, it's me saying once again, many thanks. \n<|endoftext|>
thanks \n
I scavenged the thoughts, \n
Strained them from mind \n
Set them to the corner to take form \n
And I remembered... \n
I remembered falling down steps \n
And off trees: \n
Sometimes being pushed off, \n
Sometimes merely slipping, \n
All the same- falling. \n
I remembered falling a lot. \n
I remembered sitting in class \n
Trying to learn some maths \n
And feeling a touch \n
Like of a nursing child \n
Pulling on my shirt, exploring, \n
What hasn’t been seen before; \n
The hole from the nail in the door \n
When I had passed too close… \n
Yeah, I froze like a ghost. \n
Hoping not to be seen. \n
Shame placed me in the hole \n
And put me on the stage \n
And shined light in my eyes \n
And I was seen… me and my shirt. \n
I remember it well; \n
It was blue with dragons. \n
Aunt Vadlyn – my mother’s sister- \n
Bought it for me, two Easters past, \n
I wanted it to last, \n
So I kept it, though it was torn \n
And slightly over worn – \n
It was part of the handful I had. \n
I hated when mother would bring \n
What might seem, everything, \n
For everyone, \n
But her daughters and sons. \n
The neighbors got theirs. \n
The workers got theirs. \n
From the little we had, \n
I was always behind the fad. \n
My shirt kept me afloat, \n
But, the hole and the poke \n
Were much like, \n
A sea, the ocean at whole \n
Trying to get it; \n
I wanted to drown, \n
The dead has no shame. \n
The dead had no shame. \n
The next week \n
I wore my shirt again \n
In the regular order \n
And she didn’t poke, \n
No one saw the hole. \n
I didn’t remember \n
It even. All was good. \n
Now as a man, \n
With money of my own, \n
Though not plenty- \n
Enough to buy shirts- \n
I still wear those with holes, \n
But now without shame; \n
Thank you mama. \n

He was not in to surface love, \n
Deemed it casual and for show; \n
But felt that deep within oneself \n
Was the place for love to grow. \n
Though he was never'born again', \n
In his faith he seemed secure. \n
His dealings with the trials of life, \n
Found him steady and sincere. \n
Work became his driving ethic; \n
Heavy, heavy was the load. \n
The path he walked along life's span, \n
Was a rough and and narrow road. \n
He faced life's problems straight-away \n
And he shunned hypocrisy; \n
He travelled the restrictive roads, \n
Of truth and fidelity. \n
So long ago he quit this life, \n
Leaving me alone and sad. \n
I try to follow on his course; \n
This is my thanks to you, Dad. \n<|endoftext|>

Her coat shone silky smooth that afternoon. \n
Her tail wagged like a metronome. \n
She raced the local kids around the oval. \n
They laughed and called her 'sausage dog'. \n
That night she stumbled on the stairs. \n
She whimpered when I tried to pick her up. \n
By midnight she was shivering with shock. \n
The vet suspected herniated discs. \n
Next day - incontinence and paraplegia. \n
The suited specialist duly kept us waiting. \n
Offered surgery (without a guarantee) . \n
Two thousand dollars? You must be joking! \n
The breeder said 'Give old George a ring. \n
He'll soon have her on her feet again. \n
He treats them in an open fronted shed. \n
Calls himself a canine chiropractor.' \n
George Schofield - nearly eighty five years old - \n
A nugget of a man with heart of gold, \n
Placed his stumpy hands upon her spine. \n
In seven days, my little dog was fine. \n
This happened four years ago. As far as I am aware, Old George is still manipulating dogs from all over Victoria. He works every day from 10.00am till 4.00pm. He has Tuesday's off. He must be pushing 90 by now. I'll never forget him. \n<|endoftext|>

The ancient sage, beset with too many thoughts \n
for one human lifetime, \n
chooses carefully the place to sit \n
beside the lake, \n
under the even more ancient twisted pine \n
with the view of distant cliffs \n
where the stork’s cry echoes; \n
gathers his thoughts. \n
Out of mercy, \n
the breeze gently ruffles the surface \n
of the lake; \n
the sage, reminded by the ripples \n
of the stillness of the lake, \n
smiles from a mind that’s now the lake \n
reflecting the blueness of the sky; \n
reflects, beyond the blue, \n
the space in which immortals live. \n<|endoftext|>

All around the world, \n
poems are talking among themselves \n
when the books are shut, \n
when the computers are switched off, \n
when old-fashioned poets put down \n
chewed pencils, sucked ballpens, \n
lips a little stained with the flavour \n
of ink that’s washable or permanent; \n
poems talking among themselves \n
in that language that poems understand, \n
that poets seek to write; \n
poems murmuring, complaining, \n
sometimes shouting desperately, \n
who are these people who \n
have dared to speak our language? What \n
is their right and reason? When \n
did they arise? Where \n
did they get their ideas? Why \n
do they even try? How \n
do they hope to improve on this? What \n
is a poet, anyway? \n
The tumult of their languages, \n
the babel of upraised voices \n
speaking, though, with that unutterable \n
beauty of that sound which can really act, \n
can change the world of change, \n
can touch the heart for lifetimes, \n
melts a heart of stone, \n
brings tears to eyes needful of tears, \n
opens clouds to blue sky and to sunlight, \n
watches angels as they ascend and descend, \n
speaks of, speaks, \n
the unknown, formless, eternal, ever present – \n
the tumult dies down; in the \n
silence and the stillness, \n
only the pure sound of sound itself; and \n
in that sound the absolution: \n
forgive them, O Muse of Poetry: \n
they know not what they do.. \n
yet in their hearts, they know \n
what must be said. \n
The pain, exquisite; \n
found worthy; loved. \n<|endoftext|>

Taken down nervously from shoulders. \n
As will o' the wisps on swamps \n
Hands turning white with glow of the moon \n
Hastily to wilderness bodies are wandering \n
In order to get lost in delight. \n
She is tilting the head with gilding of the weight \n

She is searching for the stronger backrest, stopping \n
The pressure of the hurricane of desire what kind of Thrusting \n

To heat it up and to melt. \n
She is finding the road for oneself only known \n

You eclipse me & I have stained the Sun with black love... \n
death from a bottle cools my ardour \n
for a while, until I see you again. \n
The damp distance is bleached \n
then blackened with shadows \n
& flocks of shrill birds, screaming for blood \n
Bound hands grow swollen \n
body – silently numbed \n
a bed on fire I laid upon \n
now reddened with burning life \n
In these blistered hours of insomnia \n
objects are like lead \n
I believe they are other things & less than they are \n
as if fewer of them would create \n
a stillness like sleep \n
— if only to dream of her again \n
The cushions beckon in the mirror \n
white & summoning, judicious \n
the bed reflected in that fantasy land, \n
that round pool of hope \n
Why stir dust on a sacred tomb \n
as I lay down with a prayer for darkness \n
a snowflake melts on her virgin eyelids \n
somewhere & now, together again \n
we drink every breath of poisoned air \n
she asleep, I awake... \n
Not believing in resurrection — \n
I stroll through cemeteries \n
looking for her name, not wanting to see it \n
the damp brown earth reminds me \n
every hour we breathe is our last; \n
victims don’t want blind skies \n
their toil & consistency as mortals \n
are truer religions than faith itself, \n
so welcome me as one of them — into your house. \n
The last star’s neon spark \n
will be dissolved painlessly. \n
Morning will knock on the window, still — \n
like a grey wet wind \n
slow day will begin to stir. \n
Livestock shiver in the cold dawn, \n
some kind of slaughterhouse morn \n
the blood drained dreams \n
dissipate, replaced by \n
perpetual sameness... \n
Awakened from a long dark dream, \n
I thought I saw her somewhere in there \n
the awesome force of sleep’s return \n
shut me down like wild song \n
like black amphibious wine \n
a hollow ghost — \n
peering senselessly through the cold \n
window of every lost night \n
This morning once again \n
on motionless ground, \n
& along with it \n
drinking cold mountain air outside; \n
refined air, once, our air... \n
Across the crisp cool valley — white snow \n
blue mountains of decrepit glass & dream \n
dissolve, in this fresh green brocade \n
Hope sparkles in the diamond dew \n
that mirrors the sun \n
for a minute \n
while across the way, beyond this place \n
despair draws its dark curtain of cloud \n
over the broken road; \n
another day annexed, \n
closer to you again, I come. \n<|endoftext|>

Parched earth awaiting a boon \n
A solitary traveller in an undulating desert \n
that got lost.... \n
Come show me the way \n
In your light, everything is clear \n
And its a sunny day \n
In your absence, its all dark and queer \n
All thoughts gone astray \n
Come show me the way \n
In your sound, everything is music to the ears \n
To which I dance and sway \n
In your absence, cacophony blares \n
All notes dark and gray \n
Come show me the way \n
In your touch, everything is pure \n
With a bright spark and a ray \n
In your absence, cannot endure \n
Even my own skin, t'is like clay \n<|endoftext|>

passion \n
Once in a saintly passion \n
I cried with desperate grief, \n
"O Lord, my heart is black with guile, \n
Of sinners I am chief." \n
Then stooped my guardian angel \n
And whispered from behind, \n
"Vanity, my little man, \n
You're nothing of the kind." \n<|endoftext|>
passion \n
She seductively sat \n
Upon my lap like a child, \n
Like a kindergartner \n
With proud innocent curls \n
On a sexy, naïve evening. \n
She placed her fingers on my lips, \n
She then pressed \n
Her whole hand \n
Against my chest, \n
She traveled south \n
And gave the slightest \n
Intoxicating touch \n
To my sensitive region. \n
We embraced \n
By soft October bridges \n
In the dark, romantic wine-glass night, \n
She told me not to speak, \n
Just to think wordless prayers. \n
And kiss her with unreserved passion. \n<|endoftext|>

Whilst riding on the phantoms of my musings \n
I came across thee and I thought \n
Are you a reflection of my soul \n
Are you the reverbration of my drum \n

Are you the song that I will hum \n
throught the night and the next \n
till I am blessed \n
with an appearance of thee \n
infront of me \n
elevating me \n
uplifting me \n
taking me \n
from finite to infinite \n
from consciousness to unconsciousness \n
from earth to heaven \n
from water to vapor \n
from darkness to light \n
from wrong to right \n
from hell to heaven \n

yours and mine \n

To achieve something great in the world you need Passion \n
To fulfill vision, a great leader’s courage comes from Passion \n
Whatever it may be, you must find your Passion \n
If passion drives you, let reason hold the reins \n
Follow your passion and success will follow you! \n
Never underestimate the power of passion \n
Without passion religion is spiritless \n
Without Passion history is meaningless \n
Without Passion art is useless \n

When you take up a mission with passion \n
There are no dreams too large \n
No innovation unimaginable \n

Follow your passion and success will follow you! \n
Our passions are the winds that propel our vessel \n
Our reason is the pilot that steers her \n
Without winds the vessel would not move \n
Without a pilot she would be lost \n
Follow your passion and success will follow you! \n
There is no end and there is no beginning \n
There is only the passion of life \n
Passion is universal humanity \n
Passion is the genesis of genius \n

passion \n
Now as Heaven is my Lot, they're the Pests of the Nation! \n
Wherever they can come \n
With clankum and blankum \n
'Tis all Botheration, & Hell & Damnation, \n
With fun, jeering \n
Conjuring \n
Sky-staring, \n
Loungerin g, \n
And still to the tune of Transmogrification-- \n
Those muttering \n
Spluttering \n
Ventriloquogusty \n
P oets \n
With no Hats \n
Or Hats that are rusty. \n
They're my Torment and Curse \n
And harass me worse \n
And bait me and bay me, far sorer I vow \n
Than the Screech of the Owl \n
Or the witch-wolf's long howl, \n
Or sheep-killing Butcher-dog's inward Bow wow \n
For me they all spite--an unfortunate Wight. \n
And the very first moment that I came to Light \n
A Rascal call'd Voss the more to his scandal, \n
Turn'd me into a sickle with never a handle. \n
A Night or two after a worse Rogue there came, \n
The head of the Gang, one Wordsworth by name-- \n
`Ho! What's in the wind?' 'Tis the voice of a Wizzard! \n
I saw him look at me most terribly blue ! \n
He was hunting for witch-rhymes from great A to Izzard, \n
And soon as he'd found them made no more ado \n
But chang'd me at once to a little Canoe. \n
From this strange Enchantment uncharm'd by degrees \n
I began to take courage & hop'd for some Ease, \n
When one Coleridge, a Raff of the self-same Banditti \n
Past by--& intending no doubt to be witty, \n
Because I'd th' ill-fortune his taste to displease, \n
He turn'd up his nose, \n
And in pitiful Prose \n
Made me into the half of a small Cheshire Cheese. \n
Well, a night or two past--it was wind, rain & hail-- \n
And I ventur'd abroad in a thick Cloak & veil-- \n
But the very first Evening he saw me again \n
The last mentioned Ruffian popp'd out of his Den-- \n
I was resting a moment on the bare edge of Naddle \n
I fancy the sight of me turn'd his Brains addle-- \n
For what was I now? \n
A complete Barley-mow \n
And when I climb'd higher he made a long leg, \n
And chang'd me at once to an Ostrich's Egg-- \n
But now Heaven be praised in contempt of the Loon, \n
I am I myself I, the jolly full Moon. \n
Yet my heart is still fluttering-- \n
For I heard the Rogue muttering-- \n
He was hulking and skulking at the skirt of a Wood \n
When lightly & brightly on tip-toe I stood \n
On the long level Line of a motionless Cloud \n
And ho! what a Skittle-ground! quoth he aloud \n
And wish'd from his heart nine Nine-pins to see \n
In brightness & size just proportion'd to me. \n
So I fear'd from my soul, \n
That he'd make me a Bowl, \n
But in spite of his spite \n
This was more than his might \n
And still Heaven be prais'd! in contempt of the Loon \n
I am I myself I, the jolly full Moon. \n<|endoftext|>

Overwhelming fires \n
That grow with the thrill of chase \n
Grant me such a kiss \n

Strange fits of passion have I known: \n
And I will dare to tell, \n
But in the lover's ear alone, \n
What once to me befell. \n
When she I loved looked every day \n
Fresh as a rose in June, \n
I to her cottage bent my way, \n
Beneath an evening-moon. \n
Upon the moon I fixed my eye, \n
All over the wide lea; \n
With quickening pace my horse drew nigh \n
Those paths so dear to me. \n
And now we reached the orchard-plot; \n
And, as we climbed the hill, \n
The sinking moon to Lucy's cot \n
Came near, and nearer still. \n
In one of those sweet dreams I slept, \n
Kind Nature's gentlest boon! \n
And all the while my eye I kept \n
On the descending moon. \n
My horse moved on; hoof after hoof \n
He raised, and never stopped: \n
When down behind the cottage roof, \n
At once, the bright moon dropped. \n
What fond and wayward thoughts will slide \n
Into a Lover's head! \n
'O mercy!' to myself I cried, \n
'If Lucy hould be dead!' \n<|endoftext|>

This is the story I was told – I’ve omitted \n
the details which might identify \n
and narrow down the nation, \n
the place, the family, the man… \n
It was in his teens, at school, \n
when the national leader arose \n
to bring the nation to its future, \n
its fulfilment, its destiny; so, like \n
his fellows, he joined the youth corps, \n
their eyes shining with ideals. \n
When the war inevitably came, \n
the time to show the world, \n
he was conscripted as a soldier. \n
He was not easy with this; killing for any noble cause \n
was not in his beliefs; he sought advice \n
in every holy book of every faith, \n
and knew within himself that he was right: \n
life is in the gift of the gods, and not of men. \n
One against the many, what could he do? \n
Should he commit suicide, there and then, \n
or its equivalent, disobey until he was shot, \n
unrecorded, unpublicised? That too, \n
he felt was wrong, life denied. \n
He decided to do just what he was told; \n
but at night, alone, to lay all this in prayer \n
at the feet of God; to sleep then and awake \n
with a conscience washed by that same God \n
who, it seemed, allowed wars just and unjust \n
for reasons which few men may unravel. \n
As war continued, this model soldier \n
rose within the ranks; and by an irony of fate \n
was chosen to be on the staff \n
of the death camps now being secretly set up. \n
How intense his prayer now became; \n
how testing was this time. \n
The details of this now are all known \n
(more than even those involved then knew) : \n
after the war, when the trials of war criminals \n
attempted human justice, some leaders \n
felt that suicide was the honourable death; \n
some lived in hope, were tried and hanged; \n
some committed to life imprisonment \n
to repent their life; or not. \n
For him (and some camp victims who survived \n
even spoke for him; ‘unyielding, \n
but never wantonly cruel’ said one) \n
and truth to tell, at that sorry time, \n
those not involved \n
sneered at ‘I was only obeying orders’, and \n
to his fellow countrymen, he was an uneasy figure \n
to represent their national conscience \n
-for him, the ten year sentence \n
was much the same as a (conscript's) monastic cell; \n
adequate sustenance, housing, humble clothes, \n
and prayer. \n
Here the story told to me \n
breaks off; I cannot say \n
whether as a model prisoner \n
he won the admiration of his guards, \n
even the love; whether he wrote this down \n
and it was lost, or may one day make a book; \n
whether, if you met him, he would shine out \n
with love and truth and wisdom, \n
even saintliness; so that \n
you'd be proud to have met him; some say \n
that when he came out of prison, aged around 38, \n
he became a schoolteacher; some say, a priest; \n
others say, a doctor in a hospital.. \n
I can only say, here was a good man; \n
and wonder how I would have behaved \n
had I been in his place; and whether, \n
as his life drew to a close, \n
he was even grateful in his soul \n
to have been so tested; and \n
to have known life whole. \n<|endoftext|>

Told when the twilight fails \n
And the monkeys walk together \n
Holding their neighbours' tails: -- \n
"Our fathers lived in the forest, \n
Foolish people were they, \n
They went down to the cornland \n
To teach the farmers to play. \n
"Our fathers frisked in the millet, \n
Our fathers skipped in the wheat, \n
Our fathers hung from the branches, \n
Our fathers danced in the street. \n
"Then came the terrible farmers, \n
Nothing of play they knew, \n
Only. . .they caught our fathers \n
And set them to labour too! \n
"Set them to work in the cornland \n
With ploughs and sickles and flails, \n
Put them in mud-walled prisons \n
And -- cut off their beautiful tails! \n
"Now, we can watch our fathers, \n
Sullen and bowed and old, \n
Stooping over the millet, \n
Sharing the silly mould, \n
"Driving a foolish furrow, \n
Mending a muddy yoke, \n
Sleeping in mud-walled prisons, \n
Steeping their food in smoke. \n
"We may not speak to our fathers, \n
For if the farmers knew \n
They would come up to the forest \n
And set us to labour too." \n
This is the horrible story \n
Told as the twilight fails \n
And the monkeys walk together \n
Holding their kinsmen's tails. \n

Deep in barren ground I feel a rumble and a quake: \n

Whenceforth He rose – ‘twas Evil’s phantasm! \n
Climax unfolds in Evil’s orgasm! \n

Incredulous now, and twice in awe, I \n
Harkened close to Evil’s roar: \n
‘I Evil, appear at your request! \n
Pray tell, of what is thine behest! \n
Your say must be bold, for you do not run, and \n
You’re evil enough – is my work not done? \n
So speak of your wanting, my impious serf, \n
To hail my cathedral so deep in this earth. ’ \n

‘Though I be Man in all his great fame, \n
My evil is lacking – my damage is lame – \n
I crave for the power that you can instill, to \n
Heighten my evil and drive up the thrill! ' \n
Evil stared in disbelief: \n
Could I see a trace of grief? \n
‘I, Evil, must say unto you: \n
I see wars of destruction – both savage and wild – \n
People lay dying – that’s woman and child! \n
All of mankind lay poisoned and green \n
From virus of hatred – oh this I have seen! \n
You fight and you kill and maim animals and all: \n
Much blood do you spill while you torture and maul. \n
You build up a town to destroy with your bombs then \n
Stab with your knives as you ravage your tombs! \n
You’re evil bar none, you ignorant fool: \n
I’ve no more to give – you already rule! \n
Evil am I - but only in noun: \n
You are the Lord that stands in your gown of \n
Evil and death – and terminal breath! \n
A figure is all that I am unto you – \n
A mirror to show and reflect \n
The evil in actions of all that you do: \n
Appeasement and love? You reject! ' \n
I stood there in silence to ponder his words - \n
And remained deep in thought ever since. \n

Evil doers will tear love down, \n
spin love round and round, \n
like a whirlwind. \n
But hold onto the love, \n
if one knows it to be true. \n
Do not listen to the lies, \n
deception, or untruths. \n
And yet, there is some consolation, \n
there is some purpose to life. \n
There is the lovely destiny, \n
that's waiting on the other side. \n
It's full of love and truth, \n
shining brightly as a star. \n
But the only way to find it, \n
is to follow the strength, \n
and beauty of the heart. \n<|endoftext|>

We are born with luck \n

As new and smooth as a grape, \n
as pure as a pond in Alaska, \n
as good as the stem of a green bean- \n
we are born and that ought to be enough, \n

learn what is subhuman, \n
learn how the blood pops out like a scream, \n
one must see the night \n
before one can realize the day, \n
one must listen hard to the animal within, \n
one must walk like a sleepwalker \n
on the edge of a roof, \n
one must throw some part of her body \n
into the devil's mouth. \n
Odd stuff, you'd say. \n
But I'd say \n
you must die a little, \n
have a book of matches go off in your hand, \n
see your best friend copying your exam, \n
visit an Indian reservation and see \n
their plastic feathers, \n
the dead dream. \n
One must be a prisoner just once to hear \n
the lock twist into his gut. \n
After all that \n
one is free to grasp at the trees, the stones, \n
the sky, the birds that make sense out of air. \n
But even in a telephone booth \n
evil can seep out of the receiver \n
and we must cover it with a mattress, \n
and then tear it from its roots \n

In evil long I took delight, \n
Unawed by shame or fear, \n
Till a new object struck my sight, \n
And stopped my wild career. \n
I saw One hanging on a tree, \n
In agony and blood, \n
Who fixed His languid eyes on me, \n
As near His cross I stood. \n
Sure, never to my latest breath, \n
Can I forget that look; \n
It seemed to charge me with His death, \n
Though not a word He spoke. \n
My conscience felt and owned the guilt, \n
And plunged me in despair, \n
I saw my sins His blood had spilt, \n
And helped to nail Him there. \n
A second look He gave, which said, \n
“I freely all forgive; \n
This blood is for thy ransom paid; \n
I die that thou mayst live.” \n
Thus, while His death my sin displays \n
In all its blackest hue, \n
Such is the mystery of grace, \n
It seals my pardon too. \n
With pleasing grief and mournful joy, \n
My spirit now is fill'd, \n
That I should such a life destroy, \n
Yet live by Him I kill'd. \n<|endoftext|>

A Night or two after a worse Rogue there came, \n
The head of the Gang, one Wordsworth by name-- \n
`Ho! What's in the wind?' 'Tis the voice of a Wizzard! \n
I saw him look at me most terribly blue ! \n
He was hunting for witch-rhymes from great A to Izzard, \n
And soon as he'd found them made no more ado \n
But chang'd me at once to a little Canoe. \n
From this strange Enchantment uncharm'd by degrees \n
I began to take courage & hop'd for some Ease, \n
When one Coleridge, a Raff of the self-same Banditti \n
Past by--& intending no doubt to be witty, \n
Because I'd th' ill-fortune his taste to displease, \n
He turn'd up his nose, \n
And in pitiful Prose \n
Made me into the half of a small Cheshire Cheese. \n
Well, a night or two past--it was wind, rain & hail-- \n
And I ventur'd abroad in a thick Cloak & veil-- \n
But the very first Evening he saw me again \n
The last mentioned Ruffian popp'd out of his Den-- \n
I was resting a moment on the bare edge of Naddle \n
I fancy the sight of me turn'd his Brains addle-- \n
For what was I now? \n
A complete Barley-mow \n
And when I climb'd higher he made a long leg, \n
And chang'd me at once to an Ostrich's Egg-- \n
But now Heaven be praised in contempt of the Loon, \n
I am I myself I, the jolly full Moon. \n
Yet my heart is still fluttering-- \n
For I heard the Rogue muttering-- \n
He was hulking and skulking at the skirt of a Wood \n
When lightly & brightly on tip-toe I stood \n
On the long level Line of a motionless Cloud \n
And ho! what a Skittle-ground! quoth he aloud \n
And wish'd from his heart nine Nine-pins to see \n
In brightness & size just proportion'd to me. \n
So I fear'd from my soul, \n
That he'd make me a Bowl, \n
But in spite of his spite \n
This was more than his might \n
And still Heaven be prais'd! in contempt of the Loon \n

Dying, she yields herself to an unending swoon, \n
And sees a pallid vision everywhere she’d glance, \n
In the azure sky where blossoms have been strewn. \n
When sometime, in her weariness, upon her sphere \n
She might permit herself to sheda furtive tear, \n

An opal fragment, iridescent as a star; \n
Within his heart, far from the sun, it’s buried deep. \n<|endoftext|>

Come, melancholy orb! that dwell'st with night, \n
Come! and o'er earth thy wand'ring lustre shed, \n
Thy deepest shadow, and thy softest light; \n

When with faint light the sloping uplands shine; \n
That gloom, those pensive rays alike I love, \n
Whose sadness seems in sympathy with mine! \n
But most for this, pale orb! thy beams are dear, \n
For this, benignant orb! I hail thee most: \n
That while I pour the unavailing tear, \n
And mourn that hope to me in youth is lost, \n
Thy light can visionary thoughts impart, \n
And lead the Muse to soothe a suff'ring heart. \n<|endoftext|>

And oft, amidst the shades of night \n
I court thy undulating light; \n
When Fairies dance around the verdant ring, \n
Or frisk beside the bubbling spring, \n
When the thoughtless SHEPHERD'S song \n
Echoes thro' the silent air, \n
As he pens his fleecy care, \n
Or plods with saunt'ring gait, the dewy meads along. \n
CHASTE ORB! as thro' the vaulted sky \n
Feath'ry clouds transparent sail; \n
When thy languid, weeping eye, \n
Sheds its soft tears upon the painted vale; \n
As I ponder o'er the floods, \n
Or tread with listless step, th'embow'ring woods, \n
O, let thy transitory beam, \n
Soothe my sad mind, with FANCY'S aëry dream. \n
Wrapt in REFLECTION, let me trace \n
O'er the vast ethereal space, \n
Stars, whose twinkling fires illume \n
Dark-brow'd NIGHT'S obtrusive gloom; \n
Where across the concave wide; \n
Flaming METEORS swiftly glide; \n
Or along the milky way, \n
Vapours shoot a silvery ray; \n
And as I mark, thy faint reclining head, \n
Sinking on Ocean's pearly bed; \n
Let REASON tell my soul, thus all things fade. \n
The Seasons change, the "garish SUN" \n
When Day's burning car hath run \n
Its fiery course, no more we view, \n
While o'er the mountain's golden head, \n
Streak'd with tints of crimson hue, \n
Twilight's filmy curtains spread, \n
Stealing o'er Nature's face, a desolating shade. \n
Yon musky FLOW'R, that scents the earth; \n
The SOD, that gave its odours birth; \n
The ROCK, that breaks the torrent's force; \n
The VALE, that owns its wand'ring course; \n
The woodlands where the vocal throng \n
Trill the wild melodious song; \n
Thirsty desarts, sands that glow, \n
Mountains, cap'd with flaky snow; \n
Luxuriant groves, enamell'd fields, \n
All, all, prolific Nature yields, \n
Alike shall end; the sensate HEART, \n
With all its passions, all its fire, \n
Touch'd by FATE'S unerring dart, \n
Shall feel its vital strength expire; \n
Those eyes, that beam with FRIENDSHIP'S ray, \n
And glance ineffable delight, \n
Shall shrink from LIFE'S translucid day, \n
And close their fainting orbs, in DEATH'S impervious night. \n
Then what remains for mortal pow'r; \n
But TIME'S dull journey to beguile; \n
To deck with joy, the winged hour, \n
To meet its sorrows with a patient smile; \n
And when the toilsome pilgrimage shall end, \n
To greet the tyrant, as a welcome friend. \n<|endoftext|>
moon \n
An old man cocked his car upon a bridge; \n
He and his friend, their faces to the South, \n
Had trod the uneven road. Their hoots were soiled, \n
Their Connemara cloth worn out of shape; \n
They had kept a steady pace as though their beds, \n
Despite a dwindling and late-risen moon, \n
Were distant still. An old man cocked his ear. \n
Aherne. What made that Sound? \n
Robartes. A rat or water-hen \n
Splashed, or an otter slid into the stream. \n
We are on the bridge; that shadow is the tower, \n
And the light proves that he is reading still. \n
He has found, after the manner of his kind, \n
Mere images; chosen this place to live in \n
Because, it may be, of the candle-light \n
From the far tower where Milton's Platonist \n
Sat late, or Shelley's visionary prince: \n
The lonely light that Samuel Palmer engraved, \n
An image of mysterious wisdom won by toil; \n
And now he seeks in book or manuscript \n
What he shall never find. \n
Ahernc. Why should not you \n
Who know it all ring at his door, and speak \n
Just truth enough to show that his whole life \n
Will scarcely find for him a broken crust \n
Of all those truths that are your daily bread; \n
And when you have spoken take the roads again? \n
Robartes. He wrote of me in that extravagant style \n
He had learnt from pater, and to round his tale \n
Said I was dead; and dead I choose to be. \n
Aherne. Sing me the changes of the moon once more; \n
True song, though speech: 'mine author sung it me.' \n
Robartes. Twenty-and-eight the phases of the moon, \n
The full and the moon's dark and all the crescents, \n
Twenty-and-eight, and yet but six-and-twenty \n
The cradles that a man must needs be rocked in: \n
For there's no human life at the full or the dark. \n
From the first crescent to the half, the dream \n
But summons to adventure and the man \n
Is always happy like a bird or a beast; \n
But while the moon is rounding towards the full \n
He follows whatever whim's most difficult \n
Among whims not impossible, and though scarred. \n
As with the cat-o'-nine-tails of the mind, \n
His body moulded from within his body \n
Grows comelier. Eleven pass, and then \n
Athene takes Achilles by the hair, \n
Hector is in the dust, Nietzsche is born, \n
Because the hero's crescent is the twelfth. \n
And yet, twice born, twice buried, grow he must, \n
Before the full moon, helpless as a worm. \n
The thirteenth moon but sets the soul at war \n
In its own being, and when that war's begun \n
There is no muscle in the arm; and after, \n
Under the frenzy of the fourteenth moon, \n
The soul begins to tremble into stillness, \n
To die into the labyrinth of itself! \n
Aherne. Sing out the song; sing to the end, and sing \n
The strange reward of all that discipline. \n
Robartes. All thought becomes an image and the soul \n
Becomes a body: that body and that soul \n
Too perfect at the full to lie in a cradle, \n
Too lonely for the traffic of the world: \n
Body and soul cast out and cast away \n
Beyond the visible world. \n
Aherne. All dreams of the soul \n
End in a beautiful man's or woman's body. \n
Robartes, Have you not always known it? \n
Aherne. The song will have it \n
That those that we have loved got their long fingers \n
From death, and wounds, or on Sinai's top, \n
Or from some bloody whip in their own hands. \n
They ran from cradle to cradle till at last \n
Their beauty dropped out of the loneliness \n
Of body and soul. \n
Robartes. The lover's heart knows that. \n
Aherne. It must be that the terror in their eyes \n
Is memory or foreknowledge of the hour \n
When all is fed with light and heaven is bare. \n
Robartes. When the moon's full those creatures of the full \n
Are met on the waste hills by countrymen \n
Who shudder and hurry by: body and soul \n
Estranged amid the strangeness of themselves, \n
Caught up in contemplation, the mind's eye \n
Fixed upon images that once were thought; \n
For separate, perfect, and immovable \n
Images can break the solitude \n
Of lovely, satisfied, indifferent eyes. \n
And thereupon with aged, high-pitched voice \n
Aherne laughed, thinking of the man within, \n
His sleepless candle and lahorious pen. \n
Robartes. And after that the crumbling of the moon. \n
The soul remembering its loneliness \n
Shudders in many cradles; all is changed, \n
It would be the world's servant, and as it serves, \n
Choosing whatever task's most difficult \n
Among tasks not impossible, it takes \n
Upon the body and upon the soul \n
The coarseness of the drudge. \n
Aherne. Before the full \n
It sought itself and afterwards the world. \n
Robartes. Because you are forgotten, half out of life, \n
And never wrote a book, your thought is clear. \n
Reformer, merchant, statesman, learned man, \n
Dutiful husband, honest wife by turn, \n
Cradle upon cradle, and all in flight and all \n
Deformed because there is no deformity \n
But saves us from a dream. \n
Aherne. And what of those \n
That the last servile crescent has set free? \n
Robartes. Because all dark, like those that are all light, \n
They are cast beyond the verge, and in a cloud, \n
Crying to one another like the bats; \n
And having no desire they cannot tell \n
What's good or bad, or what it is to triumph \n
At the perfection of one's own obedience; \n
And yet they speak what's blown into the mind; \n
Deformed beyond deformity, unformed, \n
Insipid as the dough before it is baked, \n
They change their bodies at a word. \n
Aherne. And then? \n
Rohartes. When all the dough has been so kneaded up \n
That it can take what form cook Nature fancies, \n
The first thin crescent is wheeled round once more. \n
Aherne. But the escape; the song's not finished yet. \n
Robartes. Hunchback and Saint and Fool are the last crescents. \n
The burning bow that once could shoot an arrow \n
Out of the up and down, the wagon-wheel \n
Of beauty's cruelty and wisdom's chatter -- \n
Out of that raving tide -- is drawn betwixt \n
Deformity of body and of mind. \n
Aherne. Were not our beds far off I'd ring the bell, \n
Stand under the rough roof-timbers of the hall \n
Beside the castle door, where all is stark \n
Austerity, a place set out for wisdom \n
That he will never find; I'd play a part; \n
He would never know me after all these years \n
But take me for some drunken countryman: \n
I'd stand and mutter there until he caught \n
'Hunchback and Sant and Fool,' and that they came \n
Under the three last crescents of the moon. \n
And then I'd stagger out. He'd crack his wits \n
Day after day, yet never find the meaning. \n
And then he laughed to think that what seemed hard \n
Should be so simple -- a bat rose from the hazels \n
And circled round him with its squeaky cry, \n
The light in the tower window was put out. \n<|endoftext|>

Denials are seldom put on trial. \n

To then convict someone with a sentence given. \n
And too many prevail to sit confined in prisons or jails, \n
Later to be released because of a flaw in a 'system' fails. \n

After an absence of... \n
four years intensely immersed; \n
in a foreign country \n
culture cuisine employment. \n
Sometimes the greatest \n
culture shock; \n
is coming back \n
to your home country. \n
Sometimes then \n
you do not belong; \n
in either country \n
ever ever again. \n
This is definitely true \n
when you never; \n
belonged in your home \n
country to begin with. \n
Bicultural people \n
can however; \n
be an insightful gift \n
to both cultures. \n

culture \n
A fascinating idea \n
if defines divinity in terms of humanity, \n
either by scriptural songs or \n
in scientific norms- \n
we see, religions are cultures` repetition, \n
veil in divine sensations. \n
Graciously it shaped and retains the life`s string: \n
from Indus to Nile and from Euphrates to Olympus. \n
For ages it has blessed this savage creature with faith, \n
morality and compassion, And consoles human temptations. \n
Scriptures, though sacred (but fishy too) , surely yielded from old folk's rhymes. \n
A highly affected mechanism, that synced \n
our dreams with rituals, that heals.(believers claim) \n
Neither hell nor heaven, and no \n
Armageddon nor any doomsday, \n
But all are fancies and scribbles \n
that surely fret if you gonna play. \n<|endoftext|>
future \n
It's frightening. \n
I feel better, \n
but I'm longing for a kiss. \n
One simple kiss \n
or maybe \n
not so simple. \n
I just want someone \n
to hold me when \n
the nights are empty. \n
Or maybe when I am \n
Far away, someone \n
to call me \n
when I'm blue. \n
I feel safer w/o someone \n
I'm free to linger, to laugh, \n
To flirt \n
But self esteem points \n
have reached down to the \n
negatives since my last \n
pathetic boyfriend. \n
I sit down sometimes and think: \n
Who the hell am I angry at? \n
Am I angry at the world? \n
Am I angry at you? \n
I'm not sure. \n
All I know is that the \n
more someone loves me \n
the more I hate them. \n
The more someone rejects me \n
That's when I want them around. \n
I guess I was doomed to lead \n
a dreary spinster life, \n
Or maybe settle down \n
with some rich jerk \n
who doesn't want me. \n
Either way I won't get very \n
many kisses or a phone \n
call when I'm far \n
away and \n
lonely. \n<|endoftext|>

This is a letter from me to you \n
To let you know that truly I do \n
But the words I say cannot be used freely \n
So this letter is telling you that I do really \n
I do vow to do the dishes when ever you are sick \n
and I do vow to get medicine from the pharmacy quick \n
I do vow to keep you in your wonderful dream house \n
and I do vow if that can't happen you'll never see a mouse \n
I do vow to give you all the kids you need \n
and I vow if you don't want to I'll take the lead \n
I do vow to give you the best anniversaries you ever wished \n
and I do vow if we leave your parents will be missed \n
I do vow that I will love for all of my life \n
So I say I do to you being my lawfully wedded wife \n

future \n
I think about the future, \n
And I wonder about our life. \n
To much hate for one planet, \n
To much fear. \n
Somehow, \n
I missed the announcement \n
That love had died, \n
I missed her funeral, \n
I hope it was nice. \n
Lost; \n
The masses cling to faith, \n
While the homeless \n
Cling to paper sacks, \n
Filled with empty dreams, \n
Fading, like old yellow newspapers, \n
In the rain. \n
In the future, \n
There will be a day, \n
When life \n
Will be worth more than greed; \n
And paper sacks, \n
Are just paper sacks. \n
I hope it comes soon. \n<|endoftext|>
future \n
Under the ring of linked brown arms, \n
bare feet, brown feet with whiter soles \n
drum on the dusty, hard brown earth, stomp the rhythm \n
as if to wake the gods of earth \n
to draw the rain down to the roots, \n
caressing seeds against the growing time, \n
hearing the tears at the heart of things; \n
hearing the shuffle-clank \n
of leg irons listening for some rhythm that consoles \n
with promise; hearing the blues sung softly, like a prayer, \n
taken up across the cotton field, \n
sadness meeting hope in longing patience \n
and a century ago \n
the white lady who loved Africa said, \n
I am weary with the future \n
white boy, you’re so young – \n
how could you hear the blues so well? \n
are they just around the corner \n
of every town that’s built, as dusk descends? \n
Do they lurk wherever lips meet plangent trumpet, \n
in the reeds of mourning clarinet, \n
the nostalgia of a dreaming saxophone? \n
Wherever future whispers to the past \n
and hears the sad reply? \n
white boy, white boy without a past, \n
you hear the blues so well, \n
I think you hear \n
those future blues, \n
those old white future blues, \n
those lonesome future blues. \n<|endoftext|>

My future will not copy fair my past - \n
I wrote that once; and thinking at my side \n
My ministering life-angel justified \n
The word by his appealing look upcast \n
To the white throne of God, I turned at last, \n
And there, instead, saw thee, not unallied \n
To angels in thy soul! Then I, long tried \n
By natural ills, received the comfort fast, \n
While budding, at thy sight, my pilgrim's staff \n
Gave out green leaves with morning dews impearled. \n
I seek no copy now of life's first half: \n
Leave here the pages with long musing curled, \n
And write me new my future's epigraph, \n
New angel mine, unhoped for in the world! \n<|endoftext|>
future \n
Don’t talk about the past but focus on your future \n
I would prefer to know about the previous \n
relationships of the one “my one” and I would \n
tell him every thing about me. \n
I think its something that makes \n
us closer to each other. \n
Of course I don’t like to know the details \n
such as how much he loved \n
her or what he was doing to make \n
her happy or what ever of these details \n
because it will not help or do any \n
good thing to the relationship but \n
I would ask about how these relationships ended, \n
why and what he didn’t like about them..... \n
But after talking about such things \n
with your partner you shouldn’t be \n
judgmental and you should never \n
talk about it again, or listen to any \n
one else talking to you about it, \n
or use it against him / her someday \n
because that would break your partner’s \n
heart and he/she will never be honest with you again. \n
Just listen, take what you wanted to know, \n
and throw the story behind your back. \n
Just keep in your mind that it’s the past \n
and you are your partner’s present and future \n
and this is the only important thing now and forever. \n
I personally believe you should give \n
the second part as much information \n
as he/she plans to drag out of you. \n
If one needs to know the name of every \n
other gender person you talked to, \n
then squeeze your mind and remember. \n
If he/she only asks for headlines, \n
then go ahead and offer them but \n
spare him/her the details if he/she seems \n
not wanting to bother him/herself with the \n
details of a past history. \n
What I'm trying to say, let the other part decide \n
how much they want to know, and work accordingly. \n

future \n
The doubt of future foes exiles my present joy, \n
And wit me warns to shun such snares as threaten mine annoy; \n
For falsehood now doth flow, and subjects' faith doth ebb, \n
Which should not be if reason ruled or wisdom weaved the web. \n
But clouds of joys untried do cloak aspiring minds, \n
Which turn to rain of late repent by changed course of winds. \n
The top of hope supposed the root upreared shall be, \n
And fruitless all their grafted guile, as shortly ye shall see. \n
The dazzled eyes with pride, which great ambition blinds, \n
Shall be unsealed by worthy wights whose foresight falsehood finds. \n
The daughter of debate that discord aye doth sow \n
Shall reap no gain where former rule still peace hath taught to know. \n
No foreign banished wight shall anchor in this port; \n
Our realm brooks not seditious sects, let them elsewhere resort. \n
My rusty sword through rest shall first his edge employ \n
To poll their tops that seek such change or gape for future joy. \n<|endoftext|>

Your future is here, your future is now \n

future \n
The World energy resources depleted and the oil wells are running dry \n
And perhaps in a decade from now the super rich will become poorer when they realize their money cannot buy \n
Gas to put into their big cars parked in their garages the people with nowhere to go \n
To yet it is a known fact out of hardship that spirituality can grow. \n
We are being told that this is to happen by those one might say in the know \n
The oil reserves won't last forever we heard of that decades ago \n
Yet what did we do to conserve energy we went out and bought bigger cars \n
And spent billions in money and wasted huge amounts of energy building rockets for research on Mars \n
What will happen when the oil wells will run dry when the super rich will realize \n
That Government Bureaucracies them were deceiving and leading them on with their lies \n
Will billionaires jump off of big buildings when with financial disaster they come face to face \n
In a decade from now the World as we know it could be a much different place. \n
In the future the World will be different and that may not be such a bad thing \n
For Nature will live on as usual and songbirds in the morning will sing \n
And we must go back to the pushbikes and with less pollution in the air \n
We will be far healthier people and more spiritually and environmentally aware. \n<|endoftext|>

Poems I thought had good rhythm and Rhyme, \n
And a moral good at the end of each; \n
Good Poems I thought should the test of time, \n
And remained well within the masses’ reach. \n
Poems I thought had nice music in them, \n
With apt words placed in right place in each case; \n
It was a time for Poetry’s Anthem; \n
Alas, the art is in for a rat-race! \n
Modern Poetry that is being writ, \n
From Prose is hard to ever from it sift; \n
Slang, vulgarities somehow find a place; \n

future \n
Dreams weren’t farfetched for me \n
Life wasn’t bad for me \n
I got everything I wanted, \n
Power and ability, and even opportunity \n
But I ignored something unknown. \n
I got an opportunity, \n
But I did not complete my wish. \n
I did not misuse my opportunity, \n
But this world has a sequence. \n
A flow which we all follow \n
Something I failed to do. \n
I used my powers at the wrong time. \n
I stepped into higher steps ignoring the lower ones. \n
But I failed to realize something, \n
I failed to realize that everything required a basement. \n
A basement on which it can stand. \n
A power on which it can function. \n
I ignored the lower aspects of my life, \n
I went for the larger ones and accomplished them with ease \n
But there were two things in the lower steps. \n
Two things that I ignored. \n
Time and patience. \n
I ignored the aspect of time, and looked into the future. \n
I lacked patience and was eager to reach the future. \n
But I failed to realize that the future did not exist. \n
We can never reach our future. \n
For, when we reach it, it becomes the present. \n
I failed to realize that the future is yet another present, \n
A present which I always ignored. \n
I failed to realize that we can control only our present. \n
Use the present wisely, and the future will follow up. \n
I failed to see the hidden mask of future. \n
A mask, if opened, showed that the future is just another present. \n<|endoftext|>
future \n
Sail fast, sail fast, \n
Ark of my hopes, Ark of my dreams; \n
Sweep lordly o'er the drowned Past, \n
Fly glittering through the sun's strange beams; \n
Sail fast, sail fast. \n
Breaths of new buds from off some drying lea \n
With news about the Future scent the sea: \n
My brain is beating like the heart of Haste: \n
I'll loose me a bird upon this Present waste; \n
Go, trembling song, \n
And stay not long; oh, stay not long: \n
Thou'rt only a gray and sober dove, \n
But thine eye is faith and thy wing is love. \n<|endoftext|>
future \n
the world beyond our shameless eyes \n

where money is what cheating buys \n
but never seems to grow on trees \n
tomorrow's dreams of yesterday \n
have dissipated in the heat \n
of poisons and ozone decay \n
while houses crumble in the street \n
our lives drone on repeatedly \n
toiling toward some unknown end \n
forlorn attempts die feebly \n
to fix what time itself can't mend \n
the government is fraudulent \n
and slightly skewed toward tyrany \n
what they say and what they meant \n
shout greed and mass hypocrisy \n
and for the future we invest \n
no questions asked, no answers raised \n
about the past we joke and jest \n
yet disregard the present days \n
but who's to blame, and who's to say? \n
why should the 'Land of Liberty' \n
or any other nation pay \n

future \n
I look in the mirror, \n
and what do I see? \n
A face with no future, \n
stares out at me. \n
On the table, a glass and a bottle, \n
of my favourite poison. \n
When I was young, \n
I drank to be alive. \n
Now all I do, \n
is drink to survive. \n
My eyes bloodshot, \n
filled with vacant stare. \n
My face goes unshaven, \n
but what do I care? \n
My bottle is now empty, \n
quickly replace with one full. \n
Soon it will be empty, \n
just like this fool. \n
Family and friends fled. \n
My eyes were blind. \n
All they could see, \n
was another drink, \n
in front of me. \n
My legs get unsteady. \n
I stagger instead of walk. \n
A bottle wrapped in paper, \n
gripped tightly by my hand. \n
My clothes grow dirty, \n
as days and nights combine. \n
A smile is frozen, \n
on this face of mine. \n
My arm flex out, \n
when I stumble to the ground. \n
Faces look down at me, \n
expressions display my waste. \n
I just hold my smile, \n
as I lay there in their midst. \n
At least my bottle, \n
didn’t break, \n
on my fall from grace. \n
Time for another drink, \n
raise bottle to my lips. \n
Liquid trickles down my throat, \n
and still my smile remains, \n
as silly as it can be. \n
The faces disappear. \n
Everyone has gone now. \n
Like family and friends, \n
they all desert. \n
I lay there on my own. \n
For no one wants to take, \n
a drunk home. \n

Usurped future awaits them to heap upon their plights reprieved \n
Kingdom of agony is their permanent cottages of lights bereaved \n
Freezing winters and searing summers passing by \n
Infants of heedless justice praying with weep and cry \n
Begging god for walking on meadows of unceasing happiness \n
Yearning for unfading dreams of incessant caress \n
They are mere innocent victims of hostilities \n
Deprived of even vital facilities \n
Malnutrition wreaking withdrawl of stomachs on waists of threadbare bait \n

The worms and snakes of our sins \n
Will pierce venom through our selfishness \n

Bare of all our blessings \n

poverty \n
Havoc being played upon an earth of people as they struggle \n
to live from day to day. \n
Making ends meet is no longer a tangible way of being. \n
Government has crept and cramped our lives with their inane \n
rules and greediness, tossing everyone onto waves of \n
homelessness and poverty, causing more violence, as people \n
try to adjust to an existence of mere simplicity. \n
CEO's, financiers, bankers, politicians and developers have \n
put us into a tailspin of economic recession and are now \n
expecting the American public to bail them out of their \n
extravagant ways of life - lives that they were/are living \n
at our expense. \n
Who's going to help us as we live on edges of the little we \n
have left? \n
We don't see anyone waiting in line to hand us money - not \n
even to exist on. \n

it is not always the slum in Calcutta or Bombay \n
where during the monsoon, the pus of the city \n
oozes, and women, with babies at their breasts \n
wade across filthy gutters by the roadside \n
to reach their dissolute hovels; it is not always \n
some leper on display, limbs arranged on a cart, \n
a wrinkled begging bowl of tin balanced between \n
stubs of arms, pushed by his bandaged companion. \n
We, for whom poverty is the only sin, \n
miss the true meaning of what it is to be poor. \n
Regard myself in my own comfortable cage \n
twenty concrete floors above the common street \n
surrounded by my solacing clutter of machines: \n
my washers, dryers, heaters, coolers, mixers, \n
air-conditioners, refrigerators, cookers, grinders, \n
dish washers, vacuum cleaners, hi-fi stereos, CD-Roms- \n
wonderful possessions, too numerous to mention- \n
fabricate my secure and happy delusions. My day \n
which ended with a sedative, begins with the alarm \n
of a chronometer made in Japan. Wired to a shaver, \n
I adjust temperatures, turn on the coffee maker, \n
automatically dispose garbage, receive recorded messages \n
from the office, blip the tube for the Morning News, \n
open refrigerator, collect dishes from the washer, \n
breakfast instantly, and if not constipated, defecate, \n
shower, shampoo, condition, blow-dry hair, dress, \n
descend in the elevator to my automobile, waiting \n
in the bowels of the building. After I leave, \n
the fluffy carpet smothers the floor, bolted windows \n
preserve the air-conditioning; pets, and potted plants \n
on display, strategically placed for effect, languish \n
for want of sunshine and air. \n
Regard myself among \n
all these, my indispensable possessions. Can I \n
one muffled night, walk away from all this that ties me? \n
can I, oppressed by my fears and uncertainties, \n
disappear into the night to find all the answers? \n
'I shall not rest until I have found the truth'- \n
can I take such a vow and simply leave in the dark \n
without even a note, as over two thousand years ago \n
Gautama did? With all my engagements, can I \n
without notice, even take a vacation? No, impossible. \n
I will be registered with the Missing Persons Bureau. \n
The media will blare my absence; the major newspapers \n
announcing a reward for my capture, will print my \n
picture; my wife will hire detectives to track me down, \n
and if I am found, she will probably file for divorce, \n
suing me for desertion and maltreatment. Afterwards, \n
endless alimony payments will follow as a matter of course. \n
No, my friend, even if I want to, I cannot be poor. \n
Poverty, the plain fact is, cannot be inherited; \n
it has to be acquired, for it is a quality of the mind. \n
Poverty is the lack of need, not the want of possessions. \n
It cannot be forced, because it is voluntary. \n
He who knows what it is to be poor, always walks \n
upright; using only what he needs, refusing all excesses, \n
he is the essential man, without any superfluity. \n
Or, consider another angle: \n
we humans are beings of spirit and flesh. \n
some stuff the spirit, starve the flesh, \n
some starve the spirit and stuff the flesh. \n
Some die of too little, some die of too much, \n
and all those who die are equal. Hence, \n
privation and repletion are variations \n
of the same illness. So don't think that \n
being rich, in itself, is better than being poor, \n
for in the ultimate analysis, despite your wealth, \n
can you deny, that in truth you own only yourself? \n
Beyond a certain point, \n
I do not care to prolong this argument. \n
These words formed in indignation \n
always dissolve in a calm beyond comment. \n
My philosophy is simple \n
though some consider it partisan and limited: \n
the poor define their opposites; \n
without them none would be rich. \n
Hence, if nothing else, \n
let me here declare \n
my allegiance to my deprived countrymen, \n
however unlike them I may be. \n
Let poverty be my lot, \n
let me make this meagre offering \n
at the shrine of indigence. \n
Having now come out into the open, \n
taken sides for the rest of my days, \n
let me end, \n
on a note of uncharacteristic bluntness: \n
we mustn't extend our judgements \n
to what we do not comprehend; \n
we should accept each other, \n
as we are—rich or poor- \n
or mind our own business, please. \n

poverty \n
I over heard two fellows arguing about poverty \n
Whilst I sat in the cafe drinking coffee \n
And in truth I could not help but overhear them \n
As they sat at the next table to me. \n
The older of the two a silver gray haired fellow \n
Said to rid the World of want and poverty \n
We would need to depose every despotic leader \n
But the younger bloke with him did not agree. \n
He said in so called wealthy societies there's want and hunger \n
And where affluence is poverty too abound \n
From here you don't walk far to see poor people \n
For poverty is everywhere around. \n
The older bloke countered but this is a free Country \n
And those in poverty have themselves only to blame \n
And if hungry people in our midst are living \n
Do not expect me to feel any shame \n
The younger man again with him did differ \n
Saying want is caused by those who only care \n
For themselves alone and their own self interest \n
Many must grow poorer for to make one millionaire. \n
I left them there in the cafe to argue \n
And not for me to say who is wrong or right \n
For both of them looked well dressed and well fed fellows \n
And they won't go to bed hungry tonight. \n<|endoftext|>
poverty \n
As in the house I sate, \n
Alone and desolate, \n
No creature but the fire and I, \n
The chimney and the stool, I lift mine eye \n
Up to the wall, \n
And in the silent hall, \n
Saw nothing mine \n
But some few cups and dishes shine, \n
The table and the wooden stools \n
Where people used to dine; \n
A painted cloth there was, \n
Wherein some ancient story wrought \n
A little entertained my thought, \n
Which light discovered through the glass. \n
I wondered much to see \n
That all my wealth should be \n
Confined in such a little room, \n
Yet hope for more I scarcely durst presume. \n
It grieved me sore \n
That such a scanty store \n
Should be my all; \n
For I forgot my ease and health, \n
Nor did I think of hands or eyes, \n
Nor soul nor body prize; \n
I neither thought the sun, \n
Nor moon, nor stars, nor people mine, \n
Though they did round about me shine; \n
And therefore was I quite undone. \n
Some greater things, I thought, \n
Must needs for me be wrought, \n
Which till my craving mind could see \n
I ever should lament my poverty; \n
I fain would have \n
Whatever bounty gave, \n
Nor could there be \n
Without or love or deity; \n
For should not he be infinite \n
Whose hand created me? \n
Ten thousand absent things \n
Did vex my poor and wanting mind, \n
Which, till I be no longer blind, \n
Let me not see the King of kings. \n
His love must surely be \n
Rich, infinite, and free; \n
Nor can he be thought a God \n
Of grace and power, that fills not his abode, \n
His holy court, \n
In kind and liberal sort; \n
Joys and pleasures, \n
Plenty of jewels, goods, and treasures, \n
To enrich the poor, cheer the forlorn, \n
His palace must adorn, \n
And given all to me; \n
For till his works my wealth became, \n
No love or peace did me inflame: \n
But now I have a Deity. \n<|endoftext|>
poverty \n
A room I saw \n
where the babu of poverty had been a frequent visitor \n
few walls were stark naked as if they never wore anything \n
and a few were shedding away the color they were draped in \n
The room had nothing in it \n
no furniture, nothing much to address as wearable, \n
a small blanket was there with dust marks and small holes \n
which seemed at least two decades old \n
and must've at some point been the food of rats roaming around \n
As I looked around I found \n
a few broken, rusted kitchenware kept in a corner, \n
a clay pot to store water which was dripping from the roof \n
so that for drinking it can be used \n
The room was like a cell allotted to criminals \n
hardly you can find an entrance for the air \n
the smoke coming out of the beedi that the man \n
in lungi was inhaling was all it had to offer.... \n
He was coughing, spitting in the broken bucket he had \n
there was no sign of sunshine even when it was 12 at noon on my watch, \n
food looked like a distant visitor to his house \n
it seemed, it liked the dustbin of a rich more than the stomach of a poor \n
His eyes told me a story \n
a story that I can never forget, when my eyes met his \n
of broken bodies and shattered dreams \n
of a frustrated soul and fractured beliefs \n
I could easily sense his disbelief in Gods \n
not a single image of idol was there in the entire room \n
Bhagavad Gita and Quraan too were invisible to my eyes \n
maybe because God didn't come to save his family when corruption ate it alive? \n
It was then when Kareem ran in saying \n
'Chacha jaan, MLA sahab has come to our slum...' \n
But no, he didn't move an inch \n
instead, he just blabbered something in muffled voice \n
and then lit another beedi up, \n
it seemed as if he knew all the tactics of these white dacoits... \n
He was all alone now \n
with wrinkled face and hands that trembled, \n
no longer could he pull a rickshaw or clean a garden, \n
what he could only do is to count the beads of the rosary of death... \n

poverty \n
There's smoke in the air \n
I walk stupefied; \n
For, I just witnessed a horrendous sight. \n
A thin, weakling child, clinging to an equally young mother. \n
I wonder at God's justice, \n
To the well-fed, he does not give children and to this beggarly girl (I couldn't muster strength enough to call her a woman) a child at such a young age! \n
Why O God! this disparity? \n
To one who cannot feed; a child at such a young age, and to those who can give all the joys of this world, \n
No children. \n<|endoftext|>

poverty \n
Long ago there was a king, \n
Sober, sublime and sincere, \n
One Saturday night, came an angel, \n
'Thou hath given a wish that ye can, \n
Keepeth it forever—ordain by Lord, ' \n
Quite for a moment—then said the king, \n
'O' Holy Angel, would you come next night? \n
I have to think and discuss with my coterie, \n
As ye brought a handsome lucky lottery, \n
Why not, take your own time, you take, \n
But bear in mind, only secluded wish, \n
If ye committed a mistake, ye will miss, \n
Be calm and cool, mind it—no mistake, \n
That night King lost his slumber, \n
Went to the Queen and winked, \n
Thou art be a Queen forever— \n
I have been rewarded a wish-my Miss, \n
He groped many tricks to be a King- \n
He completely changed himself with ring, \n
Of greed that bred evil within him, \n
He planned to have the wish with whim, \n
Next Saturday the Angel came and asked, \n
Your wish I shall be keeping in that pot- \n
You may keep it in a safe place, it's hot, \n
Okay—I will do as you wish my Master, \n
I wish the pot should be filled with poverty, \n
‘Cause poverty don't have liberty, \n
I will keep it, into the untrodden region of mind, \n
There's no one to see or can ever trace or find, \n
Angel lifted the hand and gifted with opened palm— \n
Shouted - -Be, ….It is yours now, you can see, \n
Angel disappeared... on that morning poor appeared, \n
A device to rule and cheat— is the only poverty, \n
Since then—It became the ruling system-continues \n
Tell me—Who will eradicate the poverty and why? \n<|endoftext|>
poverty \n
Men speak of riches and poverty, two extremes of our reality, \n
But, for many, it would seem, they never enter either extreme, \n
Some, attaining all they require, never seek to rise any higher, \n
Some are content living small, but into poverty they never fall. \n
There are two other extremes, as many chase present dreams, \n
Woven into the present reality, we see the realm of spirituality, \n
In the scope of man’s diversity, is an indifference we can see, \n
Creating in some indecision, caused by man’s worldly religion. \n
While many recognize The Lord, by many, God is just ignored, \n
And all following Jesus Christ, become rich in this present life, \n
But, all who choose to ignore, God, will remain spiritually poor, \n
Giving rise to spiritual poverty, along with a spiritual prosperity. \n
There’re men who go to church, week after week as they perch, \n
Within their very favorite pew, but, never have been born anew, \n
Hearing those they espouse, thinking there are in God’s house, \n
Empty sermons are all they preach, as Truth they do not teach. \n
Many religious people you know, are churched, but never grow, \n
Falling away, into apostasy, becoming impoverished spiritually; \n
The poor shall always be friend, until this Age comes to an end, \n
As true riches all believers see, when with God we enter Eternity. \n

poverty \n
It may be buried memories from my past \n
Though still fresh and striking to my heart \n
How I wish its effects ceases to last \n
But anytime it flashes my mind, it makes me sad. \n
I stopped writing about it few months ago \n
For it irritates the Jones and saddens the slaves \n
But whenever I spend time alone \n
I can't help it but to write on my slate. \n
Haven long been a vibrant slave myself \n
I have seen, felt and lived in slavery \n
As it drags multitudes to their premature graves \n
And causes the deceived, lots of misery. \n
I remember how it had laid a peasant farmer \n
To his peaceful rest, because he had a cut \n
But was not able to seek the help of the doctor, \n
It is a pity, I feel the pains, it pierces my heart. \n
I remember my mum, cooking in that dark kitchen, \n
Fanning the tripod stand with her mouth \n
Tears dripping from her eyes, what a poor maiden! \n
I feel her pains too, but I look into the future and laugh. \n
I also remember how dad returns from the farm, his economy \n
Where he had lived most of his life, he is very exhausted \n
But mummy still consoles him, what a happy colony! \n
Butter and sugar, have in their lives, never tasted. \n
But they always have one thing, that never perishes, \n
Although, they have been in slavery for many years \n
They have hope and dream of a new dawn of riches \n
Where poverty shall no more be their portion. \n<|endoftext|>

MY DESTINY \n
In a foggy mist stood a colossal gate \n
Where an angel stood to contemplate my faith. \n
Beyond the gates of heaven I saw \n
A world that simply left me in awe. \n
So I turned to the angel anxiety struck \n
Gathering my nerve I began to stammer \n
'What can I do to please the Lord, \n
Present to him a melody, perhaps a secret chord? ” \n
Said to me the angel serenely and tenderly, \n
'You stand right here before me \n
With your life serving testimony, \n
On earth itself you have formed your own destiny.' \n
As my life rewound in front of my eyes, \n
I couldn’t help but simply despise \n
My life on earth that I lived so callously \n
I alone was to be blamed for my destiny. \n
Through my window I could see the azure sky \n
The dream was obscure but the meaning alive. \n
I got up in a flash and slowly started to ponder \n
On my wayward life and precious moments squandered \n
I’ll change my ways, I’ll mend my life \n
As no secret chord could ever suffice. \n
To please the lord I’ll change within me \n
After all it is me who chooses my own destiny. \n

destiny \n
I live life because life lives me, \n
I try to see the real meaning \n
Of the lives that we lead, \n
Each time I search, \n
All I seem to see, \n
is a mirror with an image \n
reflecting me. \n
Is fate a truth \n
or just a word that we use \n
whenever were in doubt, \n
is this the excuse \n
guilt is a feeling, \n
that we experience through time. \n
any way we deal with it \n
it wont disappear from life. \n
happiness is great, \n
so long as it doesn’t change, \n
we feel good inside, \n
but what makes us feel this way. \n
how long is it, \n
before the greatness goes away, \n
Is it the falling of the rain, \n
or a bad day. \n
Where do I search for the words that I need, \n
to express all the emotions I forget to relieve, \n
intelligence means nothing, \n
I should know \n
it doesn’t take a genius to show how they feel. \n
Time can only tell \n
where our lives will ever go, \n
we cant do anythng \n
but see it for ourselves. \n<|endoftext|>
destiny \n
When I am happy, \n
bustling with successes in life, \n
When my dreams are fulfiiled, \n
with love and riches I desired, \n
I do not even think that, \n
my destiny brought me here, \n
I just give credit to myself. \n
When we meet our beloved, \n
when we start to love and miss each other, \n
why we give all the credit to fate and destiny? \n
We strove to get into that enchanted world, \n
we played all the rituals of the love acts, \n
There is no destiny, \n
we got into it by our own free will. \n
When we are sad, \n
with the miseries of life and death, \n
with broken dreams of happy life, \n
with tormented heart in our love oasis, \n
why we think that all of it was in our destiny? \n
Life is like an ocean wave, \n
it has low tides, \n
soon to be followed by the high tide, \n
All we need is faith and determination, \n
to get over the notion of our predetermined destiny. \n
Destiny does not shape our future, \n
we do by our deeds and actions, \n
I do not beleived in pre professed destiny, \n
because I shape my own destiny. \n<|endoftext|>

Into this world Jesus came \n
As mere flesh and bone \n
He came for our sins to atone \n
This babe, this glorious babe so pure \n
Came and suffered the punishment \n

Yes much grief and pain did he \n
Our Lord “Jesus” endure \n
What a price to pay for mankind whom \n
His genuine love we did not deserve \n
Yet through his righteousness \n
And by spilling his precious blood \n
He washed away our sins-like \n
Unto a great flood! \n
By dieing that awful day our sins were washed \n
Away with that first dropp of blood \n
He left with us his promise to arise again \n
His thirst was not quenched as the blood ran freely \n
Down his skin \n
Without Jesus’ birth and death upon Calvary \n
We would have been destroyed never to be \n
Remembered again \n
Then there would have been no \n
Way to cover our multitude of sin \n
He knew his destiny \n
Yet for you and I he still chose to die \n
He loved us so much he wanted to give \n
Us the chance of eternal life \n
With him most high \n

destiny \n
Agony entangles me and around my soul \n
Fire storms down on a winter night \n
Moonlight shines its glorious light \n
Signs of the battle for what witch will be right \n
Open the gates and carry away there fright \n
Through the valley of the thunder \n
Deep in stormy winter ice \n
Its time now so roll the dice \n
Is this the old mans advice \n
Suffering this agony is this the price \n
To stand up for glorious freedom \n
Or fall down in shame \n
You cant fly away \n
You will have to stand up and face thus \n
Brothers of fallen swords \n
Rise tonight \n
Past agony, and despair \n
Fighting onwards but can not fight away \n
Destiny awaits thee \n
Open the gates \n
Forevermore we fight \n
Fighting for freedom \n
Till the sword frees thus \n
Open the gates \n
As we walk through with honor \n
For freedom we fight \n
Freedom of personal will \n
Our souls will carry out another day \n
It will shine and raise past the universe \n
Forevermore we stay free \n
Forevermore we will fight for freedom \n
Till sword have free thus \n
For the sword I live \n
And by the sword I will fight to I die \n
For eternity I'll fight onwards even if I cant fight away \n
Ill rise again for Valhalla will await me and I will be immortal \n
For destiny will come as my time to stand by Odin's will come forth \n
As I walk through the gates \n
I walk through with honor \n
Freedom I fight to the end \n
for now destiny lays greater then kings and hummed lands \n
Fighting onwards but can not fight away \n
For freedom I fight \n
For freedom I lost sight \n
But my soul carries on \n
For now I'm immortal \n
As I stand side by side \n
destiny I ride \n
So open up the gates \n
As I walk thought with honor \n
Oh I awaited thee \n
The day when the sword would free \n
So destiny could be \n
To open the gates, \n
and walk through with honor \n
As i stand side by side with Odin \n
I am now immortal \n<|endoftext|>
destiny \n
My destiny haunts me day, my destiny haunts \n
me at nights. \n
My destiny speaks to me each morning, \n
still I have not understood what \n
"Destiny is". \n
My destiny keeps me up at nights pondering \n
about "Destiny", which I have heard so much \n
about. Yet I can not find the answer to my \n
own destiny. \n
Seeing my fellow human it would appear that \n
most of them have found the secret to this \n
destiny. But, some like myself are still in \n
search of our destiny. \n
My destiny suddenly comes to light when I was \n
near my end through the path of life. And, it \n
was at that point I became aware that my task \n
throughout my life was my destiny. \n
My destiny has been visible in my actions, in \n
my words during my life. The failer to make \n
contact with my destiny was none other, than \n
lack of understanding. \n
Destiny beckon at me with these words, "If \n
you had known the meaning of the word destiny, \n
you would not have toiled so much." \n
That is your destiny. \n<|endoftext|>
destiny \n
To a woman's womb evolves... \n
from conception through the waiting of an exact moment \n
to breathe life.... \n
Between that time of birth.... \n
until man's journey through his existence is a struggle \n
to find the reason to go on.... \n
Searching an answer from an emptiness within... \n
and open up to that basic light we were born into \n
Get into that feeling of wholeness, completeness \n
that you want to give something... out of your existence \n
And then someone accepted it... and you get connected \n
that something is given back, and you feel... \n
a kind of POWER, every man's dying to have... \n
Fulfilling this process would reveal \n
the Mystery of DESTINY... that \n
What we've been looking for... is ALWAYS HERE WITH US! \n<|endoftext|>
destiny \n
What a strange life one must lead \n
Heading towards our destruction \n
We are born to die \n
But first we must survive \n
Someone has planned that at a point in our lives \n
We will decide to destruct \n
Nothing will equal that time \n
For that will be our climax \n
Everything we feel is perfect \n
Though its not as perfect \n
As the time we reach our destiny \n
What strange happenings will befall us all \n
Before our final performance? \n
How many times will we conclude \n
That nothing can be as great as this? \n
Try as we will the conclusion \n
Will be the best performance of our lives \n
For within us all \n
Is the desire to leave the world dramatically. \n
We all must leave our mark \n
Be it only that we have lived \n
It is a mark \n
Before I go I want to say \n
Thankyou for letting me go this way \n
Don’t tell me when I must go \n
For I know when my final performance will be. \n
Prepare me to judge as I will be judged \n
So that I can know when and how to help \n
Make it hard to understand \n
So that my feelings will be my guide. \n<|endoftext|>

Walking down your path of fate \n

Which path to take, you cant decide \n

and the other its what you lose \n
You must pick now, your time is up \n
which road will you now take? \n
maybe the path of destiny \n

Life or death.......which matters most \n

destiny \n
I packed my bags \n
and left the house \n
to a DESTINY, \n
that i knew was not easy. \n
I knew there were obstacles on the way \n
still i knew i had to stay \n
the path was uneven, uneasy \n
but i knew i could not quit \n
because i knew it was my DESTINY. \n
I felt like an ant on the Noa's ark \n
i was alone there on the path, \n
i had no-one to discuss my worries \n
happines seemed to be buried \n
no shoulder to cry upon \n
no buddy to depend on \n
i felt like an ant on the Noa's ark \n
i knew i was alone there on the path. \n
Then an idea striked my mind, \n
to think and find \n
where the path was leading me to, \n
the answer i got was an unknown DESTINY where i had to go. \n
I dint know why \n
all i knew was that i had to fly \n
and reach the heights of my DESTINATION \n
for i knew in the end my life had to be an inspiration. \n<|endoftext|>
destiny \n
I stood on a hill overlooking the sea, \n
and wondered what my destiny be. \n
Would I be loved or would I be lonely? \n
Would I sail on a pirate clipper \n
in search of some lost treasure? \n
The wind ruffled my hair, \n
but the sea never spoke to me. \n
Every person has a journey, \n
for some it is long, \n
while others it is short. \n
No one can read our destiny; \n
we only make it what it is to be. \n<|endoftext|>
destiny \n
My destiny is tired. \n
The slope leads upwards, onwards, \n
Into clouds and far beyond. \n
My destiny, like me, walks slowly \n
Mumbles softly \n
Remembers ancient rhymes. \n
My destiny, not knowing why \n
Hardly realising that every game has it's rules \n
Has decided to try \n
Though, tired, and betrayed, \n
A little bit frayed \n
Has decided \n
To carry on, far beyond, with aching feet, \n
On the winding path, the trees \n
The boulders and rocks \n
To avoid the torrent gushing beneath. \n

destiny \n
1856 \n
Paris, from throats of iron, silver, brass, \n
Joy-thundering cannon, blent with chiming bells, \n
And martial strains, the full-voiced pæan swells. \n
The air is starred with flags, the chanted mass \n
Throngs all the churches, yet the broad streets swarm \n
With glad-eyed groups who chatter, laugh, and pass, \n
In holiday confusion, class with class. \n
And over all the spring, the sun-floods warm! \n
In the Imperial palace that March morn, \n
The beautiful young mother lay and smiled; \n
For by her side just breathed the Prince, her child, \n
Heir to an empire, to the purple born, \n
Crowned with the Titan's name that stirs the heart \n
Like a blown clarion--one more Bonaparte. \n
1879 \n
Born to the purple, lying stark and dead, \n
Transfixed with poisoned spears, beneath the sun \n
Of brazen Africa! Thy grave is one, \n
Fore-fated youth (on whom were visited \n
Follies and sins not thine), whereat the world, \n
Heartless howe'er it be, will pause to sing \n
A dirge, to breathe a sigh, a wreath to fling \n
Of rosemary and rue with bay-leaves curled. \n
Enmeshed in toils ambitious, not thine own, \n
Immortal, loved boy-Prince, thou tak'st thy stand \n
With early doomed Don Carlos, hand in hand \n
With mild-browed Arthur, Geoffrey's murdered son. \n
Louis the Dauphin lifts his thorn-ringed head, \n
And welcomes thee, his brother, 'mongst the dead. \n<|endoftext|>

Lost in each \n

Sharing dreams \n
That come true \n
Forever making \n
Love with you \n
Greeting every \n

Growing old \n

destiny \n
No man need fear his Destiny's bad course, \n
When challenges, he meets resolutely; \n
Defying it and hitting hard with force; \n
with prudent action, that is done timely. \n
Who cares about destiny's monstrous face, \n
If man can take refuge in God's Love-shield? \n
Why worry of Destiny's losing case, \n
When God gives grace and much wisdom to field. \n
You must refuse defeat in many things; \n
Just labour hard towards success by heart; \n
Yet, patiently take whatever life brings; \n
The Creator will surely do his part. \n
No Destiny threatens a Lion-heart; \n
Nor earthly wealth to Heaven do we cart. \n<|endoftext|>
destiny \n
nothing better than not knowing what's going to happen, \n
nothing better than eating chocolate to numb the pain. \n
wishing my friends knew that i love them, \n
wishing he knew im madly in love with him. \n
hoping the best comes out of my mistakes, \n
hoping i live to see tomorrow. \n
listening to the ones i love the most, \n
listening to the pounding heart in fear. \n
seeing nothing but a fanasty world, \n
seeing the truth that lies behind your eyes. \n
tasting the truth of life, \n
tasting the pain of unknown. \n
living like theres no tomorrow, \n
living without the truth. \n
smelling the sweet revenge, \n
smelling the destiny that lies within. \n<|endoftext|>
beauty \n
I BADE, because the wick and oil are spent \n
And frozen are the channels of the blood, \n
My discontented heart to draw content \n
From beauty that is cast out of a mould \n
In bronze, or that in dazzling marble appears, \n
Appears, but when wc have gone is gone again, \n
Being more indifferent to our solitude \n
Than 'twere an apparition. O heart, we are old; \n
The living beauty is for younger men: \n
We cannot pay its rribute of wild tears. \n<|endoftext|>
beauty \n
For Ann London \n
As you described your mastectomy in calm detail \n
and bared your chest so I might see \n
the puckered scar, \n
"They took a hatchet to your breast!" I said. "What an \n
Amazon you are." \n
When we were girls we climbed Mt. Tamalpais \n
chewing bay leaves we had plucked \n
along the way; \n
we got high all right, from animal pleasure in each other, \n
shouting to the sky. \n
On your houseboat we tried to ignore the impossible guy \n
you had married to enrage your family, \n
a typical ploy. \n
We were great fools let loose in the No Name bar \n
on Sausalito's bay. \n
In San Francisco we'd perch on a waterfront pier \n
chewing sourdough and cheese, swilling champagne, \n
kicking our heels; \n
crooning lewd songs, hooting like seagulls, \n
we bayed with the seals. \n
Then you married someone in Mexico, \n
broke up in two weeks, didn't bother to divorce, \n
claimed it didn't count. \n
You dumped number three, fled to Albany \n
to become a pedant. \n
Averse to domesticity, you read for your Ph.D. \n
Your four-year-old looked like a miniature \n
John Lennon. \n
You fed him peanut butter from your jar and raised him \n
on Beowulf and Grendal. \n
Much later in New York we reunited; \n
in an elevator at Sak's a woman asked for \n
your autograph. \n
You glowed like a star, like Anouk Aimee \n
at forty, close enough. \n
Your pedantry found its place in the Women's Movement. \n
You rose fast, seen suddenly as the morning star; \n
wrote the ERA \n
found the right man at last, a sensitive artist; \n
flying too high \n
not to crash. When the cancer caught you \n
you went on talk shows to say you had no fear \n
or faith. \n
In Baltimore we joked on your bed as you turned into \n
a witty wraith. \n
When you died I cleaned out your bureau drawers: \n
your usual disorder; an assortment of gorgeous wigs \n
and prosthetic breasts \n
tossed in garbage bags, to spare your gentle spouse. \n
Then the bequests \n
you had made to every friend you had! \n
For each of us a necklace or a ring. \n
A snapshot for me: \n
We two, barefoot in chiffon, laughing amid blossoms \n
your last wedding day. \n<|endoftext|>
beauty \n
Beauty comes within. \n
Not within the heart \n
But further, beauty within the soul. \n
If you look deep inside the soul \n
That beauty will be there. \n
It's a beautiful thing to see \n
If you're lucky enough to see it. \n
It's not on my face. \n
Not in the eyes. \n
Nor on the body. \n
The beauty is in my soul. \n
Always remember that. \n
I may not be pretty \n
nor skinny. \n
My beauty is below my heart, in my soul. \n
So if you take the time \n
And look depper \n
You'll see the beauty I see! \n<|endoftext|>
beauty \n
Some say beauty is only skin deep, and to some this may apply. \n
Outward appearance is not real beauty, I'll tell you the reason why. \n
For true beauty lies within the soul, and comes from the heart. \n
It comes not from what can be seen of us, but what we may impart. True beauty is not how we may adorn ourselves, others to impress. \n
The true beauty of each of us, lies deep within our breast. \n
If we let Jesus Christ dwell in our heart, and evermore abound. \n
Peace, Love, and beauty that comes from the Lord, will everywhere be found. \n<|endoftext|>
beauty \n
It is not Beauty I demand, \n
A crystal brow, the moon's despair, \n
Nor the snow's daughter, a white hand, \n
Nor mermaid's yellow pride of hair. \n
Tell me not of your starry eyes, \n
Your lips that seem on roses fed, \n
Your breasts where Cupid trembling lies, \n
Nor sleeps for kissing of his bed. \n
A bloomy pair of vermeil cheeks, \n
Like Hebe's in her ruddiest hours, \n
A breath that softer music speaks \n
Than summer winds a-wooing flowers. \n
These are but gauds; nay, what are lips? \n
Coral beneath the ocean-stream, \n
Whose brink when your adventurer sips \n
Full oft he perisheth on them. \n
And what are cheeks but ensigns oft \n
That wave hot youth to fields of blood? \n
Did Helen's breast though ne'er so soft, \n
Do Greece or Ilium any good? \n
Eyes can with baleful ardor burn, \n
Poison can breath that erst perfumed, \n
There's many a white hand holds an urn \n
With lovers' hearts to dust consumed. \n
For crystal brows--there's naught within, \n
They are but empty cells for pride; \n
He who the Syren's hair would win \n
Is mostly strangled in the tide. \n
Give me, instead of beauty's bust, \n
A tender heart, a loyal mind, \n
Which with temptation I could trust, \n
Yet never linked with error find. \n
One in whose gentle bosom I \n
Could pour my secret heart of woes. \n
Like the care-burdened honey-fly \n
That hides his murmurs in the rose. \n
My earthly comforter! whose love \n
So indefeasible might be, \n
That when my spirit won above \n
Hers could not stay for sympathy. \n<|endoftext|>
beauty \n
There is a power whose inspiration fills \n
Nature's fair fabric, sun- and star-inwrought, \n
Like airy dew ere any drop distils, \n
Like perfume in the laden flower, like aught \n
Unseen which interfused throughout the whole \n
Becomes its quickening pulse and principle and soul. \n
Now when, the drift of old desire renewing, \n
Warm tides flow northward over valley and field, \n
When half-forgotten sound and scent are wooing \n
From their deep-chambered recesses long sealed \n
Such memories as breathe once more \n
Of childhood and the happy hues it wore, \n
Now, with a fervor that has never been \n
In years gone by, it stirs me to respond, -- \n
Not as a force whose fountains are within \n
The faculties of the percipient mind, \n
Subject with them to darkness and decay, \n
But something absolute, something beyond, \n
Oft met like tender orbs that seem to peer \n
From pale horizons, luminous behind \n
Some fringe of tinted cloud at close of day; \n
And in this flood of the reviving year, \n
When to the loiterer by sylvan streams, \n
Deep in those cares that make Youth loveliest, \n
Nature in every common aspect seems \n
To comment on the burden in his breast -- \n
The joys he covets and the dreams he dreams -- \n
One then with all beneath the radiant skies \n
That laughs with him or sighs, \n
It courses through the lilac-scented air, \n
A blessing on the fields, a wonder everywhere. \n
Spirit of Beauty, whose sweet impulses, \n
Flung like the rose of dawn across the sea, \n
Alone can flush the exalted consciousness \n
With shafts of sensible divinity -- \n
Light of the World, essential loveliness: \n
Him whom the Muse hath made thy votary \n
Not from her paths and gentle precepture \n
Shall vulgar ends engage, nor break the spell \n
That taught him first to feel thy secret charms \n
And o'er the earth, obedient to their lure, \n
Their sweet surprise and endless miracle, \n
To follow ever with insatiate arms. \n
On summer afternoons, \n
When from the blue horizon to the shore, \n
Casting faint silver pathways like the moon's \n
Across the Ocean's glassy, mottled floor, \n
Far clouds uprear their gleaming battlements \n
Drawn to the crest of some bleak eminence, \n
When autumn twilight fades on the sere hill \n
And autumn winds are still; \n
To watch the East for some emerging sign, \n
Wintry Capella or the Pleiades \n
Or that great huntsman with the golden gear; \n
Ravished in hours like these \n
Before thy universal shrine \n
To feel the invoked presence hovering near, \n
He stands enthusiastic. Star-lit hours \n
Spent on the roads of wandering solitude \n
Have set their sober impress on his brow, \n
And he, with harmonies of wind and wood \n
And torrent and the tread of mountain showers, \n
Has mingled many a dedicative vow \n
That holds him, till thy last delight be known, \n
Bound in thy service and in thine alone. \n
I, too, among the visionary throng \n
Who choose to follow where thy pathway leads, \n
Have sold my patrimony for a song, \n
And donned the simple, lowly pilgrim's weeds. \n
From that first image of beloved walls, \n
Deep-bowered in umbrage of ancestral trees, \n
Where earliest thy sweet enchantment falls, \n
Tingeing a child's fantastic reveries \n
With radiance so fair it seems to be \n
Of heavens just lost the lingering evidence \n
From that first dawn of roseate infancy, \n
So long beneath thy tender influence \n
My breast has thrilled. As oft for one brief second \n
The veil through which those infinite offers beckoned \n
Has seemed to tremble, letting through \n
Some swift intolerable view \n
Of vistas past the sense of mortal seeing, \n
So oft, as one whose stricken eyes might see \n
In ferny dells the rustic deity, \n
I stood, like him, possessed, and all my being, \n
Flooded an instant with unwonted light, \n
Quivered with cosmic passion; whether then \n
On woody pass or glistening mountain-height \n
I walked in fellowship with winds and clouds, \n
Whether in cities and the throngs of men, \n
A curious saunterer through friendly crowds, \n
Enamored of the glance in passing eyes, \n
Unuttered salutations, mute replies, -- \n
In every character where light of thine \n
Has shed on earthly things the hue of things divine \n
I sought eternal Loveliness, and seeking, \n
If ever transport crossed my brow bespeaking \n
Such fire as a prophetic heart might feel \n
Where simple worship blends in fervent zeal, \n
It was the faith that only love of thee \n
Needed in human hearts for Earth to see \n
Surpassed the vision poets have held dear \n
Of joy diffused in most communion here; \n
That whomsoe'er thy visitations warmed, \n
Lover of thee in all thy rays informed, \n
Needed no difficulter discipline \n
To seek his right to happiness within \n
Than, sensible of Nature's loveliness, \n
To yield him to the generous impulses \n
By such a sentiment evoked. The thought, \n
Bright Spirit, whose illuminings I sought, \n
That thou unto thy worshipper might be \n
An all-sufficient law, abode with me, \n
Importing something more than unsubstantial dreams \n
To vigils by lone shores and walks by murmuring streams. \n
Youth's flowers like childhood's fade and are forgot. \n
Fame twines a tardy crown of yellowing leaves. \n
How swift were disillusion, were it not \n
That thou art steadfast where all else deceives! \n
Solace and Inspiration, Power divine \n
That by some mystic sympathy of thine, \n
When least it waits and most hath need of thee, \n
Can startle the dull spirit suddenly \n
With grandeur welled from unsuspected springs, -- \n
Long as the light of fulgent evenings, \n
When from warm showers the pearly shades disband \n
And sunset opens o'er the humid land, \n
Shows thy veiled immanence in orient skies, -- \n
Long as pale mist and opalescent dyes \n
Hung on far isle or vanishing mountain-crest, \n
Fields of remote enchantment can suggest \n
So sweet to wander in it matters nought, \n
They hold no place but in impassioned thought, \n
Long as one draught from a clear sky may be \n
A scented luxury; \n
Be thou my worship, thou my sole desire, \n
Thy paths my pilgrimage, my sense a lyre \n
Aeolian for thine every breath to stir; \n
Oft when her full-blown periods recur, \n
To see the birth of day's transparent moon \n
Far from cramped walls may fading afternoon \n
Find me expectant on some rising lawn; \n
Often depressed in dewy grass at dawn, \n
Me, from sweet slumber underneath green boughs, \n
Ere the stars flee may forest matins rouse, \n
Afoot when the great sun in amber floods \n
Pours horizontal through the steaming woods \n
And windless fumes from early chimneys start \n
And many a cock-crow cheers the traveller's heart \n
Eager for aught the coming day afford \n
In hills untopped and valleys unexplored. \n
Give me the white road into the world's ends, \n
Lover of roadside hazard, roadside friends, \n
Loiterer oft by upland farms to gaze \n
On ample prospects, lost in glimmering haze \n
At noon, or where down odorous dales twilit, \n
Filled with low thundering of the mountain stream, \n
Over the plain where blue seas border it \n
The torrid coast-towns gleam. \n
I have fared too far to turn back now; my breast \n
Burns with the lust for splendors unrevealed, \n
Stars of midsummer, clouds out of the west, \n
Pallid horizons, winds that valley and field \n
Laden with joy, be ye my refuge still! \n
What though distress and poverty assail! \n
Though other voices chide, yours never will. \n
The grace of a blue sky can never fail. \n
Powers that my childhood with a spell so sweet, \n
My youth with visions of such glory nursed, \n
Ye have beheld, nor ever seen my feet \n
On any venture set, but 'twas the thirst \n
For Beauty willed them, yea, whatever be \n
The faults I wanted wings to rise above; \n
I am cheered yet to think how steadfastly \n
I have been loyal to the love of Love! \n<|endoftext|>
beauty \n
A thing of beauty is a joy for ever: \n
Its lovliness increases; it will never \n
Pass into nothingness; but still will keep \n
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep \n
Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing. \n
Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing \n
A flowery band to bind us to the earth, \n
Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth \n
Of noble natures, of the gloomy days, \n
Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkn'd ways \n
Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all, \n
Some shape of beauty moves away the pall \n
From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon, \n
Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon \n
For simple sheep; and such are daffodils \n
With the green world they live in; and clear rills \n
That for themselves a cooling covert make \n
'Gainst the hot season; the mid-forest brake, \n
Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms: \n
And such too is the grandeur of the dooms \n
We have imagined for the mighty dead; \n
An endless fountain of immortal drink, \n
Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink. \n<|endoftext|>
beauty \n
Is that the only way we can become like Indians, like Rhinoceri, \n
like Quartz Crystals, like organic farmers, like what we imagine \n
Adam & Eve to’ve been, caressing each other with trembling limbs \n
before the Snake of Revolutionary Sex wrapped itself round \n
The Tree of Knowledge? What would Roque Dalton joke about lately \n
teeth chattering like a machine gun as he dabated mass tactics \n
with his Companeros? Necessary to kill the Yanquis with big bomb \n
Yes but don’t do it by yourself, better consult your mother \n
to get the Correct Line of Thought, if not consult Rimbaud once he got his leg cut off \n
or Lenin after his second stroke sending a message thru Mrs Krupskaya \n
to the rude Georgian, & just before his deathly fit when the Cheka aides \n
outside \n
his door looked in coldly assuring him his affairs were in good hands no need to move - What sickness at the \n
pit of his stomach moved up to \n
his brain? \n
What thought Khlebnikov on the hungry train exposing his stomach to the \n
sun? \n
Or Mayakovsky before the bullet hit his brain, what sharp propaganda for \n
action \n
on the Bureaucratic Battlefield in the Ministry of Collective Agriculture in \n
Ukraine? \n
What Slogan for Futurist architects or epic hymn for masses of Communist \n
Party Card holders in Futurity \n
on the conduct of the world seeking beauty against Government? \n<|endoftext|>
beauty \n
For beauty I am not a star, \n
There are others more perfect by far, \n
But my face I don't mind it, \n
For I am behind it, \n
It is those in front that I jar. \n<|endoftext|>
beauty \n
WHEN from my cheek I lift my veil, \n
The roses turn with envy pale, \n
And from their pierced hearts, rich with pain, \n
Send forth their fragrance like a wail. \n
Or if perchance one perfumed tress \n
Be lowered to the wind's caress, \n
The honeyed hyacinths complain, \n
And languish in a sweet distress. \n
And, when I pause, still groves among, \n
(Such loveliness is mine) a throng \n
Of nightingales awake and strain \n
Their souls into a quivering song. \n<|endoftext|>
beauty \n
I went for a walk with my love \n
down to an old vacant lot she took me \n
littered, and broken up \n
it made me sad, \n
made me think of myself \n
I asked why she took me there \n
she silently smiled \n
and took my hand \n
led me to a place \n
The pavement was cracked \n
the ground heaped with garbage \n
old and new \n
near a makeshift shelter \n
that some one had left \n
She kissed my tears away \n
told me to smile \n
when I asked why \n
she told me to open my eyes \n
leaving me confused \n
she said to look at the beauty \n
surrounding us \n
then began to point \n
the doorway of the crude shack \n
was open, and the was a spiderweb \n
moist with the morning dew \n
small dropp formed at it ran down \n
and it was beautiful \n
A few feet away \n
there was a daffodil \n
growing, thriving \n
despite the battered tarmac \n
through which it found a way \n
standing tall and proud \n
as well it should \n
and it was beautiful \n
Just then we looked up \n
and what did we see \n
a blue jay landing atop the roof \n
and began singing it's song \n
The sun was rising \n
peaking over the horizon \n
painting it red, orange, \n
yellow, and even violet \n
the sky was it's canvas \n
and it was beautiful \n
She took me home \n
pointing at many other things \n
while we strolled home \n
when we got there \n
I thanked her \n
told her she was beautiful \n
she stood me in front a mirror \n
telling me to find the beauty \n
there we stood for many long minutes \n
I looked, I saw, I contemplated \n
the sorrow carved into my features \n
the gentle wonder in my eyes \n
the scars life has left upon me \n
and it was beautiful \n<|endoftext|>
beauty \n
The sovereign beauty which I do admire, \n
Witness the world how worthy to be praised: \n
The light whereof hath kindled heavenly fire \n
In my frail spirit, by her from baseness raised; \n
That being now with her huge brightness dazed, \n
Base thing I can no more endure to view; \n
But looking still on her, I stand amazed \n
At wondrous sight of so celestial hue. \n
So when my tongue would speak her praises due, \n
It stopped is with thought's astonishment: \n
And when my pen would write her titles true, \n
It ravish'd is with fancy's wonderment: \n
Yet in my heart I then both speak and write \n
The wonder that my wit cannot endite. \n<|endoftext|>
beauty \n
I was a 20 year old unemployed receptionist with dyed orange dreadlocks sprouting out of my skull. I needed a job, but first, I needed a haircut. \n
So I head for this beauty salon on Avenue B. \n
I'm gonna get a hairdo. \n
I'm gonna look just like those hot Spanish haircut models, become brown and bodacious, grow some 7 inch fingernails painted bitch red and rake them down the chalkboard of the job market's soul. \n
So I go in the beauty salon. \n
This beautiful Puerto Rican girl in tight white spandex and a push-up bra sits me down and starts chopping my hair: \n
"Girlfriend," she says, "what the hell you got growing outta your head there, what is that, hair implants? Yuck, you want me to touch that shit, whadya got in there, sandwiches?" \n
I just go: "I'm sorry." \n
She starts snipping my carefully cultivated Johnny Lydon post-Pistols hairdo. My foul little dreadlocks are flying around all over the place but I'm not looking in the mirror cause I just don't want to know. \n
"So what's your name anyway?" My stylist demands then. \n
"Uh, Maggie." \n
"Maggie? Well, that's an okay name, but my name is Suzy." \n
"Yeah, so?" \n
"Yeah so it ain't just Suzy S.U.Z.Y, I spell it S.U.Z.E.E, the extra "e" is for extra Suzee." \n
I nod emphatically. \n
Suzee tells me when she's not busy chopping hair, she works as an exotic dancer at night to support her boyfriend named Rocco. Suzee loves Rocco, she loves him so much she's got her eyes closed as she describes him: \n
"6 foot 2, 193 pounds and, girlfriend, his arms so big and long they wrap around me twice like I'm a little Suzee sandwich." \n
Little Suzee Sandwich is rapt, she blindly snips and clips at my poor punk head. She snips and clips and snips and clips, she pauses, I look in the mirror: "Holy shit, I'm bald." \n
"Holy shit, baby, you're bald." Suzee says, finally opening her eyes and then gasping. \n
All I've got left is little post-nuke clumps of orange fuzz. And I'll never get a receptionist job now. \n
But Suzy waves her manicured finger in my face: "Don't you worry, baby, I'm gonna get you a job at the dancing club." \n
"What?" \n
" ;Baby, let me tell you, the boys are gonna like a bald go go dancer." \n
That said, she whips out some clippers, shaves my head smooth and insists I'm gonna love getting naked for a living. \n
None of this sounds like my idea of a good time, but I'm broke and I'm bald so I go home and get my best panties. Suzee lends me some 6 inch pumps, paints my lips bright red, and gives me 7 shots of Jack Daniels to relax me. \n
8pm that night I take the stage. \n
I'm bald, \n
I'm drunk, \n
and by god, \n
I'm naked. \n
HOLY SHIT I'M NAKED IN A ROOM FULL OF STRANGERS THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE RECURRING NIGHTMARES WE ALL HAVE ABOUT BEING BUTT NAKED IN PUBLIC, I AM NAKED, I DON'T KNOW THESE PEOPLE, THIS REALLY SUCKS. \n
A few guys feel sorry for me and risk getting their hands bitten off by sticking dollars in my garter belt. My disheveled pubic hairs stand at full attention, ready to poke the guys' eyes out if they get too close. \n
Then I notice this bald guy in the audience, I've got a new empathy for bald people, I figure maybe it works both ways, maybe this guy will stick 10 bucks in my garter. \n
I saunter over. \n
I'm teetering around unrhythmically, I'm the surliest, unsexiest dancer that ever go-go across this hemisphere. The bald guy looks down into his beer, he'd much rather look at that than at my pubic mound which has now formed into one vicious spike so it looks like I've got a unicorn in my crotch. \n
I stand there weaving through the air. \n
The strobe light is illuminating my pubic unicorn. Madonna's song Borderline is pumping through the club's speaker system for the 5th time tonight: "BORDERLINE BORDERLINE BORDERLINE/LOVE ME TIL I JUST CAN'T SEE." And suddenly, I start to wonder: What does that mean anyway? \n
"LOVE ME TIL I JUST CAN'T SEE" \n
What? \n
Screw me so much my eyes pop out, I go blind, end up walking down 2nd Avenue crazy, horny, naked and blind? What? \n
There's a glitch in the tape and it starts to skip. \n
"Borderl...ooop.....Borderl.... ooop...Borderlin.....ooop" \n
I stumble and twist my ankle. My g-string rides between my buttcheeks making me twitch with pain. My head starts spinning, my knees wobble, I go down on all fours and puke all over the bald guy's lap. \n
So there I am. Butt naked on all fours. But before I have time to regain my composure, the strip club manager comes over, points his smarmy strip club manager finger at me and goes: \n
"You're bald, you're drunk, you can't dance and you're fired." \n
I stand up. \n
"Oh yeah, well you stink like a sneaker, pal." I peel off one of my pumps and throw it in the direction of his fat head then I get the hell out of there. \n
A few days later I run into Suzee on Avenue A. Turns out she got fired for getting me a job there in the first place. But she was completely undaunted, she dragged me up to this wig store on 14th Street, bought me a mouse brown shag wig, then got us both telemarketing jobs on Wall Street. \n
And I never went to a beauty salon again. \n<|endoftext|>
beauty \n
There was in her face, \n
in the contours of her \n
beauty lines \n
a past smoothing out \n
which I could see \n
would match \n
her older photographs. \n
The older her \n
only hinted at \n
that prior \n
state. \n
But I took my time \n
to look at her \n
now past 55 \n
to see \n
in that older landscape \n
what my eye \n
sought \n
in her face at twenty and five.. \n
Could not the face \n
before me \n
be seen \n
on its own terms? \n
Where is that beauty \n
line between \n
beauty and non-beauty? \n
Is it the tightness of the skin \n
the twinkle in the eye, \n
healthy look or \n
non-healthy look? \n
What's true is that \n
my own Western \n
eye \n
can only see age; \n
not nobility; \n
only TV screen beauty- \n
not maturity. \n
But you know \n
there are a myriad of exceptions; \n
children don't see age \n
the same way we do \n
nor does most of the world. \n
What is going on here? \n<|endoftext|>

The beauty of a Summer's day begins \n
Watching the bright, morning sun rise, \n
Dew upon the lawn and roses, \n
And the early flight of colorful butterflies. \n
The beauty of a Summer's day \n
Is an attractive and picturesque one, \n
A sky of a variable color of pale to light blue, \n
And sport and entertainment for everyone. \n
The beauty of a Summer's day \n
Is stetched with green foliage on the hill, \n
And colorful wildflowers bordering the roadway, \n
The water wheel turning at the grist mill. \n
The beauty of a Summer's day increases \n
Watching the rolling waves of the ocean, \n
Sea shells washing upon the sandy shore, \n
And gazing at the sea gulls gliding in slow motion. \n
The finality of a Summer's day \n
Is depicted with memorable scenes \n
Of picnicking, camping, swimming, and traveling, \n
Reserved for Summer enthusiasts for future dreams. \n<|endoftext|>
beauty \n
AH whither, Love, wilt thou now carry me? \n
What wontless fury dost thou now inspire \n
Into my feeble breast, too full of thee? \n
Whilst seeking to aslake thy raging fire, \n
Thou in me kindlest much more great desire, \n
And up aloft above my strength dost raise \n
The wondrous matter of my fire to praise. \n
That as I erst in praise of thine own name, \n
So now in honour of thy mother dear, \n
An honourable hymn I eke should frame, \n
And with the brightness of her beauty clear, \n
The ravish'd hearts of gazeful men might rear \n
To admiration of that heavenly light, \n
From whence proceeds such soul-enchanting might. \n
Thereto do thou, great goddess, queen of beauty, \n
Mother of love, and of all world's delight, \n
Without whose sovereign grace and kindly duty \n
Nothing on earth seems fair to fleshly sight, \n
Do thou vouchsafe with thy love-kindling light \n
T' illuminate my dim and dulled eyne, \n
And beautify this sacred hymn of thine: \n
That both to thee, to whom I mean it most, \n
And eke to her, whose fair immortal beam \n
Hath darted fire into my feeble ghost, \n
That now it wasted is with woes extreme, \n
It may so please, that she at length will stream \n
Some dew of grace into my withered heart, \n
After long sorrow and consuming smart. \n
WHAT time this world's great Workmaster did cast \n
To make all things such as we now behold, \n
It seems that he before his eyes had plac'd \n
A goodly pattern, to whose perfect mould \n
He fashion'd them as comely as he could; \n
That now so fair and seemly they appear, \n
As nought may be amended anywhere. \n
That wondrous pattern, wheresoe'er it be, \n
Whether in earth laid up in secret store, \n
Or else in heaven, that no man may it see \n
With sinful eyes, for fear it to deflore, \n
Is perfect Beauty, which all men adore; \n
Whose face and feature doth so much excel \n
All mortal sense, that none the same may tell. \n
Thereof as every earthly thing partakes \n
Or more or less, by influence divine, \n
So it more fair accordingly it makes, \n
And the gross matter of this earthly mine, \n
Which clotheth it, thereafter doth refine, \n
Doing away the dross which dims the light \n
Of that fair beam which therein is empight. \n
For, through infusion of celestial power, \n
The duller earth it quick'neth with delight, \n
And lifeful spirits privily doth pour \n
Through all the parts, that to the looker's sight \n
They seem to please. That is thy sovereign might, \n
O Cyprian queen, which flowing from the beam \n
Of thy bright star, thou into them dost stream. \n
That is the thing which giveth pleasant grace \n
To all things fair, that kindleth lively fire, \n
Light of thy lamp, which, shining in the face, \n
Thence to the soul darts amorous desire, \n
And robs the hearts of those which it admire; \n
Therewith thou pointest thy son's poison'd arrow, \n
That wounds the life, and wastes the inmost marrow. \n
How vainly then do idle wits invent, \n
That beauty is nought else but mixture made \n
Of colours fair, and goodly temp'rament \n
Of pure complexions, that shall quickly fade \n
And pass away, like to a summer's shade; \n
Or that it is but comely composition \n
Of parts well measur'd, with meet disposition. \n
Hath white and red in it such wondrous power, \n
That it can pierce through th' eyes unto the heart, \n
And therein stir such rage and restless stour, \n
As nought but death can stint his dolour's smart? \n
Or can proportion of the outward part \n
Move such affection in the inward mind, \n
That it can rob both sense and reason blind? \n
Why do not then the blossoms of the field, \n
Which are array'd with much more orient hue, \n
And to the sense most dainty odours yield, \n
Work like impression in the looker's view? \n
Or why do not fair pictures like power shew, \n
In which oft-times we nature see of art \n
Excell'd, in perfect limning every part? \n
But ah, believe me, there is more than so, \n
That works such wonders in the minds of men; \n
I, that have often prov'd, too well it know, \n
And whoso list the like assays to ken, \n
Shall find by trial, and confess it then, \n
That beauty is not, as fond men misdeem, \n
An outward shew of things, that only seem. \n
For that same goodly hue of white and red, \n
With which the cheeks are sprinkled, shall decay, \n
And those sweet rosy leaves, so fairly spread \n
Upon the lips, shall fade and fall away \n
To that they were, even to corrupted clay; \n
That golden wire, those sparkling stars so bright, \n
Shall turn to dust; and lose their goodly light. \n
But that fair lamp, from whose celestial ray \n
That light proceeds, which kindleth lovers' fire, \n
Shall never be extinguish'd nor decay; \n
But when the vital spirits do expire, \n
Unto her native planet shall retire; \n
For it is heavenly born and cannot die, \n
Being a parcel of the purest sky. \n
For when the soul, the which derived was, \n
At first, out of that great immortal Spright, \n
By whom all live to love, whilom did pass \n
Down from the top of purest heaven's height \n
To be embodied here, it then took light \n
And lively spirits from that fairest star, \n
Which lights the world forth from his fiery car. \n
Which power retaining still or more or less, \n
When she in fleshly seed is eft enraced, \n
Through every part she doth the same impress, \n
According as the heavens have her graced, \n
And frames her house, in which she will be placed, \n
Fit for herself, adorning it with spoil \n
Of th' heavenly riches which she robb'd erewhile. \n
Thereof it comes that these fair souls, which have \n
The most resemblance of that heavenly light, \n
Frame to themselves most beautiful and brave \n
Their fleshly bower, most fit for their delight, \n
And the gross matter by a sovereign might \n
Tempers so trim, that it may well be seen \n
A palace fit for such a virgin queen. \n
So every spirit, as it is most pure, \n
And hath in it the more of heavenly light, \n
So it the fairer body doth procure \n
To habit in, and it more fairly dight \n
With cheerful grace and amiable sight. \n
For of the soul the body form doth take: \n
For soul is form, and doth the body make. \n
Therefore wherever that thou dost behold \n
A comely corpse, with beauty fair endued, \n
Know this for certain, that the same doth hold \n
A beauteous soul, with fair conditions thewed, \n
Fit to receive the seed of virtue strewed. \n
For all that fair is, is by nature good; \n
That is a sign to know the gentle blood. \n
Yet oft it falls that many a gentle mind \n
Dwells in deformed tabernacle drown'd, \n
Either by chance, against the course of kind, \n
Or through unaptness in the substance found, \n
Which it assumed of some stubborn ground, \n
That will not yield unto her form's direction, \n
But is deform'd with some foul imperfection. \n
And oft it falls, (ay me, the more to rue) \n
That goodly beauty, albe heavenly born, \n
Is foul abus'd, and that celestial hue, \n
Which doth the world with her delight adorn, \n
Made but the bait of sin, and sinners' scorn, \n
Whilst every one doth seek and sue to have it, \n
But every one doth seek but to deprave it. \n
Yet nathëmore is that fair beauty's blame, \n
But theirs that do abuse it unto ill: \n
Nothing so good, but that through guilty shame \n
May be corrupt, and wrested unto will: \n
Natheless the soul is fair and beauteous still, \n
However flesh{"e}s fault it filthy make; \n
For things immortal no corruption take. \n
But ye fair dames, the world's dear ornaments \n
And lively images of heaven's light, \n
Let not your beams with such disparagements \n
Be dimm'd, and your bright glory dark'ned quite; \n
But mindful still of your first country's sight, \n
Do still preserve your first informed grace, \n
Whose shadow yet shines in your beauteous face. \n
Loathe that foul blot, that hellish firebrand, \n
Disloyal lust, fair beauty's foulest blame, \n
That base affections, which your ears would bland, \n
Commend to you by love's abused name, \n
But is indeed the bondslave of defame; \n
Which will the garland of your glory mar, \n
And quench the light of your bright shining star. \n
But gentle Love, that loyal is and true, \n
Will more illumine your resplendent ray, \n
And add more brightness to your goodly hue, \n
From light of his pure fire; which, by like way \n
Kindled of yours, your likeness doth display; \n
Like as two mirrors, by oppos'd reflection, \n
Do both express the face's first impression. \n
Therefore, to make your beauty more appear, \n
It you behoves to love, and forth to lay \n
That heavenly riches which in you ye bear, \n
That men the more admire their fountain may; \n
For else what booteth that celestial ray, \n
If it in darkness be enshrined ever, \n
That it of loving eyes be viewed never? \n
But, in your choice of loves, this well advise, \n
That likest to yourselves ye them select, \n
The which your forms' first source may sympathize, \n
And with like beauty's parts be inly deckt; \n
For, if you loosely love without respect, \n
It is no love, but a discordant war, \n
Whose unlike parts amongst themselves do jar. \n
For love is a celestial harmony \n
Of likely hearts compos'd of stars' concent, \n
Which join together in sweet sympathy, \n
To work each other's joy and true content, \n
Which they have harbour'd since their first descent \n
Out of their heavenly bowers, where they did see \n
And know each other here belov'd to be. \n
Then wrong it were that any other twain \n
Should in love's gentle band combined be \n
But those whom Heaven did at first ordain, \n
And made out of one mould the more t' agree; \n
For all that like the beauty which they see, \n
Straight do not love; for love is not so light \n
As straight to burn at first beholder's sight. \n
But they, which love indeed, look otherwise, \n
With pure regard and spotless true intent, \n
Drawing out of the object of their eyes \n
A more refined form, which they present \n
Unto their mind, void of all blemishment; \n
Which it reducing to her first perfection, \n
Beholdeth free from flesh's frail infection. \n
And then conforming it unto the light, \n
Which in itself it hath remaining still, \n
Of that first Sun, yet sparkling in his sight, \n
Thereof he fashions in his higher skill \n
An heavenly beauty to his fancy's will; \n
And it embracing in his mind entire, \n
The mirror of his own thought doth admire. \n
Which seeing now so inly fair to be, \n
As outward it appeareth to the eye, \n
And with his spirit's proportion to agree, \n
He thereon fixeth all his fantasy, \n
And fully setteth his felicity; \n
Counting it fairer than it is indeed, \n
And yet indeed her fairness doth exceed. \n
For lovers' eyes more sharply sighted be \n
Than other men's, and in dear love's delight \n
See more than any other eyes can see, \n
Through mutual receipt of beam{"e}s bright, \n
Which carry privy message to the spright, \n
And to their eyes that inmost fair display, \n
As plain as light discovers dawning day. \n
Therein they see, through amorous eye-glances, \n
Armies of loves still flying to and fro, \n
Which dart at them their little fiery lances; \n
Whom having wounded, back again they go, \n
Carrying compassion to their lovely foe; \n
Who, seeing her fair eyes' so sharp effect, \n
Cures all their sorrows with one sweet aspect. \n
In which how many wonders do they rede \n
To their conceit, that others never see, \n
Now of her smiles, with which their souls they feed, \n
Like gods with nectar in their banquets free; \n
Now of her looks, which like to cordials be; \n
But when her words' embássade forth she sends, \n
Lord, how sweet music that unto them lends. \n
Sometimes upon her forehead they behold \n
A thousand graces masking in delight; \n
Sometimes within her eyelids they unfold \n
Ten thousand sweet belgards, which to their sight \n
Do seem like twinkling stars in frosty night; \n
But on her lips, like rosy buds in May, \n
So many millions of chaste pleasures play. \n
All those, O Cytherea, and thousands more \n
Thy handmaids be, which do on thee attend, \n
To deck thy beauty with their dainties' store, \n
That may it more to mortal eyes commend, \n
And make it more admir'd of foe and friend: \n
That in men's hearts thou may'st thy throne install, \n
And spread thy lovely kingdom over all. \n
Then Iö, triumph! O great Beauty's Queen, \n
Advance the banner of thy conquest high, \n
That all this world, the which thy vassals bene, \n
May draw to thee, and with due fealty \n
Adore the power of thy great majesty, \n
Singing this hymn in honour of thy name, \n
Compil'd by me, which thy poor liegeman am. \n
In lieu whereof grant, O great sovereign, \n
That she whose conquering beauty doth captive \n
My trembling heart in her eternal chain, \n
One drop of grace at length will to me give, \n
That I her bounden thrall by her may live, \n
And this same life, which first fro me she reaved, \n
May owe to her, of whom I it received. \n
And you, fair Venus' darling, my dear dread, \n
Fresh flower of grace, great goddess of my life, \n
When your fair eyes these fearful lines shall read, \n
Deign to let fall one drop of due relief, \n
That may recure my heart's long pining grief, \n
And shew what wondrous power your beauty hath, \n
That can restore a damned wight from death. \n<|endoftext|>
beauty \n
Beauty is the sensation of your heart skipping a beat, \n
when eyes full of mischief glance at you... \n
Beauty is the smile which appears on your lips, when you think of the way he smiles at you... \n
Beauty is in the heart which touches another \n
Beauty is tender hands holding each other \n
Beauty is strong arms holding you warm \n
Beauty is in water, beauty is in weather, \n
beauty is in air, beauty is in life \n
Beauty is in love, beauty is in wind... \n
Beauty surrounds you days and nights \n
yet no one knows beauty's heights... \n<|endoftext|>
beauty \n
There was intoxication in the air; \n
The wind, keen blowing from across the seas, \n
O'er leagues of new-ploughed land and heathery leas, \n
Smelt of wild gorse whose gold flamed everywhere. \n
And undertone of song pulsed far and near, \n
The soaring larks filled heaven with ecstasies, \n
And, like a living clock among the trees, \n
The shouting cuckoo struck the time of year. \n
For now the Sun had found the earth once more, \n
And woke the Sleeping Beauty with a kiss; \n
Who thrilled with light of love in every pore, \n
Opened her flower-blue eyes, and looked in his. \n
Then all things felt life fluttering at their core-- \n
The world shook mystical in lambent bliss. \n<|endoftext|>
beauty \n
WHAT does it mean? Tired, angry, and ill at ease, \n
No man, woman, or child alive could please \n
Me now. And yet I almost dare to laugh \n
Because I sit and frame an epitaph- \n
'Here lies all that no one loved of him \n
And that loved no one.' Then in a trice that whim \n
Has wearied. But, though I am like a river \n
At fall of evening when it seems that never \n
Has the sun lighted it or warmed it, while \n
Cross breezes cut the surface to a file, \n
This heart, some fraction of me, hapily \n
Floats through a window even now to a tree \n
Down in the misting, dim-lit, quiet vale; \n
Not like a pewit that returns to wail \n
For something it has lost, but like a dove \n
That slants unanswering to its home and love. \n
There I find my rest, and through the dusk air \n
Flies what yet lives in me. Beauty is there \n<|endoftext|>
beauty \n
I \n
FAIR is my Love and cruel as she 's fair; \n
Her brow-shades frown, although her eyes are sunny. \n
Her smiles are lightning, though her pride despair, \n
And her disdains are gall, her favours honey: \n
A modest maid, deck'd with a blush of honour, \n
Whose feet do tread green paths of youth and love; \n
The wonder of all eyes that look upon her, \n
Sacred on earth, design'd a Saint above. \n
Chastity and Beauty, which were deadly foes, \n
Live reconciled friends within her brow; \n
And had she Pity to conjoin with those, \n
Then who had heard the plaints I utter now? \n
For had she not been fair, and thus unkind, \n
My Muse had slept, and none had known my mind. \n
II \n
My spotless love hovers with purest wings, \n
About the temple of the proudest frame, \n
Where blaze those lights, fairest of earthly things, \n
Which clear our clouded world with brightest flame. \n
My ambitious thoughts, confined in her face, \n
Affect no honour but what she can give; \n
My hopes do rest in limits of her grace; \n
I weigh no comfort unless she relieve. \n
For she, that can my heart imparadise, \n
Holds in her fairest hand what dearest is; \n
My Fortune's wheel 's the circle of her eyes, \n
Whose rolling grace deign once a turn of bliss. \n
All my life's sweet consists in her alone; \n
So much I love the most Unloving one. \n
III \n
And yet I cannot reprehend the flight \n
Or blame th' attempt presuming so to soar; \n
The mounting venture for a high delight \n
Did make the honour of the fall the more. \n
For who gets wealth, that puts not from the shore? \n
Danger hath honour, great designs their fame; \n
Glory doth follow, courage goes before; \n
And though th' event oft answers not the same-- \n
Suffice that high attempts have never shame. \n
The mean observer, whom base safety keeps, \n
Lives without honour, dies without a name, \n
And in eternal darkness ever sleeps.-- \n
And therefore, Delia, 'tis to me no blot \n
To have attempted, tho' attain'd thee not. \n
IV \n
When men shall find thy flow'r, thy glory, pass, \n
And thou with careful brow, sitting alone, \n
Received hast this message from thy glass, \n
That tells the truth and says that All is gone; \n
Fresh shalt thou see in me the wounds thou mad'st, \n
Though spent thy flame, in me the heat remaining: \n
I that have loved thee thus before thou fad'st-- \n
My faith shall wax, when thou art in thy waning. \n
The world shall find this miracle in me, \n
That fire can burn when all the matter 's spent: \n
Then what my faith hath been thyself shalt see, \n
And that thou wast unkind thou may'st repent.-- \n
Thou may'st repent that thou hast scorn'd my tears, \n
When Winter snows upon thy sable hairs. \n
V \n
Beauty, sweet Love, is like the morning dew, \n
Whose short refresh upon the tender green \n
Cheers for a time, but till the sun doth show, \n
And straight 'tis gone as it had never been. \n
Soon doth it fade that makes the fairest flourish, \n
Short is the glory of the blushing rose; \n
The hue which thou so carefully dost nourish, \n
Yet which at length thou must be forced to lose. \n
When thou, surcharged with burthen of thy years, \n
Shalt bend thy wrinkles homeward to the earth; \n
And that, in Beauty's Lease expired, appears \n
The Date of Age, the Calends of our Death-- \n
But ah, no more!--this must not be foretold, \n
For women grieve to think they must be old. \n
VI \n
I must not grieve my Love, whose eyes would read \n
Lines of delight, whereon her youth might smile; \n
Flowers have time before they come to seed, \n
And she is young, and now must sport the while. \n
And sport, Sweet Maid, in season of these years, \n
And learn to gather flowers before they wither; \n
And where the sweetest blossom first appears, \n
Let Love and Youth conduct thy pleasures thither. \n
Lighten forth smiles to clear the clouded air, \n
And calm the tempest which my sighs do raise; \n
Pity and smiles do best become the fair; \n
Pity and smiles must only yield thee praise. \n
Make me to say when all my griefs are gone, \n
Happy the heart that sighed for such a one! \n
VII \n
Let others sing of Knights and Paladines \n
In aged accents and untimely words, \n
Paint shadows in imaginary lines, \n
Which well the reach of their high wit records: \n
But I must sing of thee, and those fair eyes \n
Authentic shall my verse in time to come; \n
When yet th' unborn shall say, Lo, where she lies! \n
Whose beauty made him speak, that else was dumb! \n
These are the arcs, the trophies I erect, \n
That fortify thy name against old age; \n
And these thy sacred virtues must protect \n
Against the Dark, and Time's consuming rage. \n
Though th' error of my youth in them appear, \n
Suffice, they show I lived, and loved thee dear. \n<|endoftext|>

Cut skin, \n
Matching Tattoos, \n
Alluring night, \n
Tantalizing moon, \n
Friends were on drugs \n
Sauntering down \n
The summer avenues, \n
Hands clasped tightly \n
By romantic youths \n
With sexual aspirations! \n
We made promises \n
To each other \n
Amid the madness \n
To remain \n
Tragically in love \n

Of this talking nature, \n
Only speaks the truth! \n
Says it louder \n
But we, going away \n
Ignore it, putting it to an end \n
To the signal that’s yelling \n
Happiness is within \n
Find it inside, not anywhere \n
In nature’s lap \n
Nowhere else \n
Chirping birds, crocking frogs \n
Newly born day \n
And its aroma \n
All is for free \n

Get it on time \n

happiness \n
I am no Christ, Buddha or Gandhi \n
Or a wandering fakir or sanyasi. \n
I am an ordinary human being, \n
If someone slaps me \n
I cannot turn the other cheek. \n
I don't think it makes me weak. \n
I find it difficult to walk \n
On the eight fold path. \n
I have no lofty mission \n
To free mankind of suffering. \n
If I can make one person smile, \n
It makes me feel satisfied. \n
For I can not spread happiness and cheer, \n
If I am miserable and full of fear. \n
I cannot be totally selfless, \n
And efface my identity. \n
I owe it to myself to love me, \n
I don’t care if others feel \n
I am selfish. \n
Happiness is not something \n
You can achieve \n
Merely for the asking. \n
With experience you will find \n
It is a state of mind, \n
You attain when you make peace \n
With what is. \n
Once the awareness comes, \n
You are no longer feverish and \n
Others naturally feel comfort \n
In your company. \n<|endoftext|>
happiness \n
The happiness of others is my happiness- \n
Their sadness is my sadness- \n
Without them I cannot wholly be who I am- \n
And what they are to me \n
Helps make me real to myself. \n<|endoftext|>
happiness \n
Happiness is that which everyone longs \n
but so few of us actually get \n
Happiness is that which rights all wrongs \n
and leaves us without regret \n
Why then does happiness torture us so \n
when all we want is to feel \n
what happiness does in the lowest of low \n
when everything just seems too real \n
Happiness comes to so many of you \n
you who think it will always be there \n
Happiness leaves you without the clue \n
that living without is a nightmare \n
If happiness could be passed on \n
would you then give it to me \n
Will you then cry when it is gone \n
and realise what it is to feel lonely \n

A smile or a laugh, \n

I asked the professors who teach the meaning of life to tell \n
me what is happiness. \n
And I went to famous executives who boss the work of \n
thousands of men. \n
They all shook their heads and gave me a smile as though \n
I was trying to fool with them \n
And then one Sunday afternoon I wandered out along \n

And I saw a crowd of Hungarians under the trees with \n
their women and children and a keg of beer and an \n

A child’s happy laugh, running free \n
Gasps of wonder, on making a discovery \n
That shy winsome giggle, on a first date \n
Silent conversations that leap beyond fate \n
A moan of delight when we soar together \n
When souls tenderly mingle, that hushed surrender \n
And that song between heartbeats \n
When a soulmate is near! \n<|endoftext|>
happiness \n
the irony of this pursuit is this: \n
the more you pursue it \n
the more it escapes \n
away from your grasp \n
you think your hands \n
finally catch \n
happiness, and you \n
hold on to it \n
tightly like you \n
are a bird with claws \n
like an eagle holding \n
on to the monkey \n
then blood drifts \n
on the holy mountains \n
the paradox lies \n
not in the taking of happiness \n
but in giving it away \n
and then the magic happens \n
the mountains dance \n
the caves open \n
and the rivers sing \n
it is clear, when you take it \n
you simply release it \n
then you are happy \n
and the pursuit is nothing \n
but \n
in simply the giving \n
the patience of waiting \n
like a tree whose fruits \n
are ripe where children \n
climb \n
gather the fruits \n
and chew and swallow \n

Let others sing of gold and gear, the joy of being rich; \n
But oh, the days when I was poor, a vagrant in a ditch! \n
When every dawn was like a gem, so radiant and rare, \n
And I had but a single coat, and not a single care; \n
When I would feast right royally on bacon, bread and beer, \n
And dig into a stack of hay and doze like any peer; \n
When I would wash beside a brook my solitary shirt, \n
And though it dried upon my back I never took a hurt; \n
When I went romping down the road contemptuous of care, \n
And slapped Adventure on the back -- by Gad! we were a pair; \n
When, though my pockets lacked a coin, and though my coat was old, \n
The largess of the stars was mine, and all the sunset gold; \n
When time was only made for fools, and free as air was I, \n
And hard I hit and hard I lived beneath the open sky; \n
When all the roads were one to me, and each had its allure . . . \n
Ye Gods! these were the happy days, the days when I was poor. \n
II \n
Or else, again, old pal of mine, do you recall the times \n
You struggled with your storyettes, I wrestled with my rhymes; \n
Oh, we were happy, were we not? -- we used to live so "high" \n
(A little bit of broken roof between us and the sky); \n
Upon the forge of art we toiled with hammer and with tongs; \n
You told me all your rippling yarns, I sang to you my songs. \n
Our hats were frayed, our jackets patched, our boots were down at heel, \n
But oh, the happy men were we, although we lacked a meal. \n
And if I sold a bit of rhyme, or if you placed a tale, \n
What feasts we had of tenderloins and apple-tarts and ale! \n
And yet how often we would dine as cheerful as you please, \n
Beside our little friendly fire on coffee, bread and cheese. \n
We lived upon the ragged edge, and grub was never sure, \n
But oh, these were the happy days, the days when we were poor. \n
III \n
Alas! old man, we're wealthy now, it's sad beyond a doubt; \n
We cannot dodge prosperity, success has found us out. \n
Your eye is very dull and drear, my brow is creased with care, \n
We realize how hard it is to be a millionaire. \n
The burden's heavy on our backs -- you're thinking of your rents, \n
I'm worrying if I'll invest in five or six per cents. \n
We've limousines, and marble halls, and flunkeys by the score, \n
We play the part . . . but say, old chap, oh, isn't it a bore? \n
We work like slaves, we eat too much, we put on evening dress; \n
We've everything a man can want, I think . . . but happiness. \n
Come, let us sneak away, old chum; forget that we are rich, \n
And earn an honest appetite, and scratch an honest itch. \n
Let's be two jolly garreteers, up seven flights of stairs, \n
And wear old clothes and just pretend we aren't millionaires; \n
And wonder how we'll pay the rent, and scribble ream on ream, \n
And sup on sausages and tea, and laugh and loaf and dream. \n
And when we're tired of that, my friend, oh, you will come with me; \n
And we will seek the sunlit roads that lie beside the sea. \n
We'll know the joy the gipsy knows, the freedom nothing mars, \n
The golden treasure-gates of dawn, the mintage of the stars. \n
We'll smoke our pipes and watch the pot, and feed the crackling fire, \n
And sing like two old jolly boys, and dance to heart's desire; \n
We'll climb the hill and ford the brook and camp upon the moor . . . \n
Old chap, let's haste, I'm mad to taste the Joy of Being Poor. \n<|endoftext|>
joy \n
The greatest joy on earth is our children; \n
To see them born healthy and grow up well; \n
To see them acquire God's precious ken, \n
That guides them to Heaven, avoiding hell. \n
What joy it is to see them walk on fours! \n
And learn to move, to utter sounds with sense; \n
What joy it is to hear their mental stores! \n
To see them worldly-wise, avoid non-sense. \n
What, joy to see the child, Father of man! \n
What joy to see them outdo their parents! \n
What joy when things we cannot do, they can! \n
What joy to see their God-given talents? \n
Our children are the apples of our eyes; \n
The Almighty God, we see, in their guise. \n<|endoftext|>
joy \n
Past ash cans and alley cats, \n
Fetid. overflowing gutters, \n
Leprous lines of rancid flats \n
Where the frowsy linen flutters; \n
With a rattle and a jar, \n
hark! I sing a happy ditty, \n
As I speed my Master far \n
From the poison of the City. \n
Speed him to the sportive sea, \n
Watch him walloping the briny, \n
Light his pipe and brew his tea \n
In a little wood that's piny; \n
Haven him to peace of mind. \n
Drowsy dreams in pleasant places, \n
Where the woman's eyes are kind, \n
And the men have ruddy faces. \n
Just a jaloppy am I, \n
But he's always been my lover, \n
So each Sunday morn I try \n
Youthful joy to re-discover. \n
For he loves the wild and free, \n
And though he would never know it, \n
Nature thrills him with the glee \n
And the rapture of the poet. \n
He's a little invoice clerk, \n
I'm a worn and ancient flivver; \n
I have an asthmatic spark, \n
He an alcoholic liver; \n
Yet with clatter, clang and creak \n
We are lyrical for one day; \n
Then another loathly week, \n
Living for another Sunday. \n<|endoftext|>

So high. My Life Is You You wrote your name in my heart. Because you \n
say you still love me so much. I Love you to. \n
To let this beautiful love go out of my lift. My \n

joy \n
I think I'm going to make it through, \n
It's been so long you see; \n
There's much more life behind me now \n
Than out in front of me. \n
There was a time, when not so sure; \n
I thought to end it then. \n
I didn't see how one could live \n
Without much joy and win. \n
But I found out you can endure \n
Without a special one. \n
And after all, it must be said; \n
Of fate, what's done is done. \n
And so I choose to carry on \n
With life and burdens bore. \n
I hope if I can carry these, \n
God may not give me more. \n
But if He did, I hope He'd grant, \n
My just one simple plea; \n
To end my life with one great love \n
Who'd bring great joy to me. \n
So now I'm near the end of life, \n
My joyless days near done. \n
I'd lie if I would dare to say, \n
I never did have fun. \n
But what is true, and that's the rub, \n
Of life, don't you agree; \n
Is love is really what's required, \n
For joy to be set free? \n
So on it is with what remains, \n
I hope, not very long; \n
Of life, perhaps to know great love, \n
If it should come along. \n
And as I go my separate way, \n
I'll not begrudge their joy; \n
If others feel what I once felt, \n
When I was just a boy. \n
Instead I'll smile and just recall \n
The joy I felt back then. \n
And know that I'll feel soon enough \n
Love's wondrous joy again. \n<|endoftext|>
joy \n
I love the way you take my hand and \n
Lead me through the lane, \n

So don't fell the pain. \n
A mother's love is the strongest type and \n
This you cannot deny, \n
Thank you for always being my light \n
You are the perfect guide. \n
I've never thought about much \n
'I love you' really means. \n
You've always found the time to listen \n
To my highs, lows and in betweens \n
I'll never really understand how \n
You have the energy to care, \n
There is no doubt about it I'll always respect \n
The joy you have to share. \n<|endoftext|>

How they glimmer, how they quiver! \n
Sparkling one another after, \n

Is the joy of joy \n
But i seek for the pain \n
The Sweetness in Pain \n
Pain in Silence \n
Silence in Loneliness \n
Loneliness in Joy \n
Cuz everything has its Joy! \n
Joy in joy can only be stong \n
If after the aeons of pain \n
A ray of mirth shines \n
So joy is even incomplete without pain, sorrow etc. \n
And so i plead to God \n
Fill my soul with bitterness \n
Fill my life with Pain \n

I will search my self \n<|endoftext|>

Joyful, joyful, we adore Thee, \n

Melt the clouds of sin and sadness; \n
Drive the dark of doubt away; \n
Giver of immortal gladness, \n
Fill us with the light of day! \n
All Thy works with joy surround Thee, \n
Earth and heaven reflect Thy rays, \n
Stars and angels sing around Thee, \n
Centre of unbroken praise: \n
Field and forest, vale and mountain, \n
Blooming meadow, flashing sea, \n
Chanting bird and flowing fountain, \n
Call us to rejoice in Thee. \n
Thou art giving and forgiving, \n
Ever blessing, ever blest, \n
Well-spring of the joy of living, \n
Ocean-depth of happy rest! \n
Thou our Father, Christ our Brother, -- \n
All who live in love are Thine: \n
Teach us how to love each other, \n
Lift us to the Joy Divine. \n
Mortals join the mighty chorus, \n
Which the morning stars began; \n
Father-love is reigning o'er us, \n
Brother-love binds man to man. \n
Ever singing march we onward, \n
Victors in the midst of strife; \n
Joyful music lifts us sunward \n

joy \n
Each day I live I thank the Lord \n
I do the work I love; \n
And in it find a rich reward, \n
All price and praise above. \n
For few may do the work they love, \n
The fond unique employ, \n
That fits them as a hand a glove, \n
And gives them joy. \n
Oh gentlefolk, do you and you \n
Who toil for daily hire, \n
Consider that the job you do \n
Is to your heart's desire? \n
Aye, though you are to it resigned, \n
And will no duty shirk, \n
Oh do you in your private mind \n
Adore your work? \n
Twice happy man whose job is joy, \n
Whose hand and heart combine, \n
In brave and excellent employ \n
As radiantly as mine! \n
But oh the weary, dreary day, \n
The wear and tear and irk \n
Of countless souls who cannot say: \n
'I love my work.' \n<|endoftext|>
joy \n
No matter how serene things \n
may be in my life, \n
how well things are going, \n
my body and soul \n
are two cliff peaks \n
from which a dream of who I can be \n
falls, and I must learn \n
to fly again each day, \n
or die. \n
Death draws respect \n
and fear from the living. \n
Death offers \n
no false starts. It is not \n
a referee with a pop-gun \n
at the startling \n
of a hundred yard dash. \n
I do not live to retrieve \n
or multiply what my father lost \n
or gained. \n
I continually find myself in the ruins \n
of new beginnings, \n
uncoiling the rope of my life \n
to descend ever deeper into unknown abysses, \n
tying my heart into a knot \n
round a tree or boulder, \n
to insure I have something that will hold me, \n
that will not let me fall. \n
My heart has many thorn-studded slits of flame \n
springing from the red candle jars. \n
My dreams flicker and twist \n
on the altar of this earth, \n
light wrestling with darkness, \n
light radiating into darkness, \n
to widen my day blue, \n
and all that is wax melts \n
in the flame- \n
I can see treetops! \n<|endoftext|>
joy \n
There's not a joy the world can give like that it takes away \n
When the glow of early thought declines in feeling's dull decay; \n
'Tis not on youth's smooth cheek the blush alone, which fades so fast, \n
But the tender bloom of heart is gone, ere youth itself be past. \n
Then the few whose spirits float above the wreck of happiness \n
Are driven o'er the shoals of guilt, or ocean of excess: \n
The magnet of their course is gone, or only points in vain \n
The shore to which their shivered sail shall never stretch again. \n
Then the mortal coldness of the soul like death itself comes down; \n
It cannot feel for others' woes, it dare not dream its own; \n
That heavy chill has frozen o'er the fountain of our tears, \n
And though the eye may sparkle still, 'tis where the ice appears. \n
Though wit may flash from fluent lips, and mirth distract the breast, \n
Through midnight hours that yield no more their former hope of rest, \n
'Tis but as ivy-leaves around the ruined turret wreath— \n
All green and wildly fresh without, but worn and grey beneath. \n
Oh, could I feel as I have felt, or be what I have been, \n
Or weep as I could once have wept, o'er many a vanished scene; \n
As springs in deserts found seem sweet, all brackish though they be, \n
So, midst the withered waste of life, those tears would flow to me. \n<|endoftext|>

My dearest Frank, I wish you joy \n
Of Mary's safety with a Boy, \n
Whose birth has given little pain \n
Compared with that of Mary Jane.-- \n

And well deserve his Parents' Love!-- \n
Endow'd with Art's and Nature's Good, \n
Thy Name possessing with thy Blood, \n
In him, in all his ways, may we \n
Another Francis WIlliam see!-- \n
Thy infant days may he inherit, \n
THey warmth, nay insolence of spirit;-- \n
We would not with one foult dispense \n
To weaken the resemblance. \n
May he revive thy Nursery sin, \n
Peeping as daringly within, \n
His curley Locks but just descried, \n
With 'Bet, my be not come to bide.'-- \n
Fearless of danger, braving pain, \n
And threaten'd very oft in vain, \n
Still may one Terror daunt his Soul, \n
One needful engine of Controul \n
Be found in this sublime array, \n
A neigbouring Donkey's aweful Bray. \n
So may his equal faults as Child, \n
Produce Maturity as mild! \n
His saucy words and fiery ways \n
In early Childhood's pettish days, \n
In Manhood, shew his Father's mind \n
Like him, considerate and Kind; \n
All Gentleness to those around, \n
And anger only not to wound. \n
Then like his Father too, he must, \n
To his own former struggles just, \n
Feel his Deserts with honest Glow, \n
And all his self-improvement know. \n
A native fault may thus give birth \n
To the best blessing, conscious Worth. \n
As for ourselves we're very well; \n
As unaffected prose will tell.-- \n
Cassandra's pen will paint our state, \n
The many comforts that await \n
Our Chawton home, how much we find \n
Already in it, to our mind; \n
And how convinced, that when complete \n
It will all other Houses beat \n
The ever have been made or mended, \n
With rooms concise, or rooms distended. \n
You'll find us very snug next year, \n
Perhaps with Charles and Fanny near, \n
For now it often does delight us \n

Love, faithful love, recalled thee to my mind-- \n
But how could I forget thee? Through what power, \n
Even for the least division of an hour, \n
Have I been so beguiled as to be blind \n
To my most grievous loss?--That thought's return \n
Was the worst pang that sorrow ever bore, \n

racism \n
Racism is the deadliest form of cancer \n
For our society, it is a serious danger \n
Racism is a form of terror \n
Racism is a cancerous disease \n
It is about ignorance and prejudice \n
It is in the streets, it is in the air \n
It is volatile, it is everywhere. \n
Racism is like a chameleon \n
It is a fatal and lethal weapon \n
Racism is a form of hatred and bigotry \n
It is a false sense of superiority \n
By many ignorant goons with a light pigmentation \n
It is about false ideologies and strange perception \n
It is about being evil and using unfair practices \n
It is about discriminating on false pretenses. \n
Not all obnoxious racists lack some forms of education \n
Many of them have advanced degrees, their contention \n
Is that those steadfast fools want to protect the status quos \n
They create all types of standard in order to block \n
Or prevent Non-Whites from reaching their potentials \n
They discriminate, humiliate, make fun of and mocked \n
Anybody that they consider weak intellectually \n
Or inferior. Racism is about hate, greed, and bigotry. \n
Racism is about prejudice, shame, and ignorance \n
It is about not giving somebody a one-time chance \n
It is about not second guessing. They just start shooting \n
Killing, destroying, discriminating and annihilating \n
Racism is about insecurity, and putting up blocks \n
Some Caucasians and others feel better than or superior \n
To Asians, Indians, Africans, Afro- Americans or Blacks \n
Those Whites have a mental state which is inferior \n
Deficient, weak, hollow, feeble, unstable, and challenged \n
Regardless, many Whites will die as racists; they will not change \n
And others, who are quietly biased, will be a bit tolerant \n
But they remain very dangerous, by being secretly defiant. \n
Racism is a deadly illness, a cancer \n
Racism about being rude and unfair \n
To other people by treating \n
Them badly, differently \n
And inhumanely \n
By poking them with a toxic syringe \n
Racism is to lead a rambunctious mob \n
Against someone who is innocent \n
Racism is to hire an African to do a job \n
And then creating a hostile working environment \n
Because he or she looks different \n
There is nothing good about racism \n
It is a form injustice, violence and fascism. \n

racism \n
I was born and reared in Southern Illinois. That region of Illinois then a part of the Segregated South. The schools I attended were not as functional as those the white kids enjoyed. Appreciating movies at the local Roxy Theatre required a lonely climb upstairs to the balcony. I've sipped water from fountains designated 'Negro Only, ' and well remember the 'Colored' signs at the rear of the 'Tri-City' bus. At an advanced age, in the center of one of the World's most renowned regions, where least expected, I've heard the disparaging word 'nigger' directed my way on separate occasions. \n
As an activated USMC Reservist during the Korean Conflict, I was deployed to Parris Island, South Carolina. Arriving in Beaufort soon after daybreak, famished, amid thoughts centered on an uncertain future, I was oblivious to the cultural mores around me. Dressed in full military regalia, toting a fully packed sea-bag, I entered the nearest restaurant seeking a mere breakfast meal. I was met at the door with words I shall never forget, 'We don't serve Colored People here.' My Country had just ordered me to submit my life to protect it, with death if necessary, yet found it convenient to deny me a decent meal in a comfortable setting. \n
Racial insensitivity, once experienced, remains indelibly ingrained, precisely defining bigotry whenever and wherever it appears. I've seen its presence in proliferated acts of political expediency. Known it denied in spite of the critical obvious. Have witnessed those who claim to abhor the practice, sit silently in tacit approval. Folks who observe, yet fail to condemn are as culpable, I'm convinced, as any committing the overt act. \n

Better golfers to learn proficient English just to get a check? \n
What’s happened to competition, head to head with the best? \n
Do we have to wait for another Olympics to put skill to the test? \n
I though only in politics via the cold war did this stuff exist, \n
Now the “sport” of women’s golf is going be added to the list. \n
Sports is an activity governed by a set of competitive rules, \n
Not to be goverend by where you did or did not go to school, \n
Going from one country to another you don’t need a visa to play, \n
Just a passport, there is no test as to what you can or cannot say. \n
True, not every country like our United States has free speech, \n
However, you need not be fluent in the local just to compete, \n
Playing against the world’s best is what makes golf so sweet, \n
Not sending them home because you’re tired of getting beat. \n
I know this is not all the players only a handful of spoiled quitters, \n
Sometimes is seems as though a few caddies are also baby sitters, \n
The one and only way to be the best is to beat the ones that are, \n
Who wants to watch a match with winners barely breaking par? \n
This a demeaning, stupid, selfish, insensitive, bitter, jealous rule, \n
You become a better golfer by going to UCLA instead of Q school? \n
I certainly hope this insensitiveness doesn’t too last long or go very far, \n
Will parking a Taurus next to a S600 Benz make the Ford a better car? \n
Didn’t the word golf mean, “Gentlemen Only Ladies Forbidden? ” \n
Now it’s the ladies who are trying to keep the best players hidden? \n
OK, hide your mama, jewelry, money, Picasso, Rembrandt or Monet, \n
But don’t hide the best foreign players by not allowing them to play. \n
There’s an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, EEOC, \n
We should have one for the Equal Opportunity To Play, EOTP, \n
The 1st means you have rights if American Black or Latino Brown, \n
Number two won’t discriminate if you can’t tell a verb from a noun. \n
Most born and raised here do not know, just listen to their speech, \n
Many are insturctors in class rooms and they are the ones who teach, \n
There was a time when slaves were killed teaching each other to read, \n
This is simply the principle of, “good old fashioned American Greed.” \n
First there was the “noose” incident around the neck of Tiger Woods, \n
Now players are going to be penalized because they are too good, \n
Have you heard the one about fast foods? What do you think of that? \n
World carry out & delivery will be illegal so only Americans can get fat. \n
Many are reporting the decision was made and it's the sponsors call, \n
Still, it’s up to the American players, they’re the ones who hit the ball, \n
Whomever, to see that it is wrong you don’t need the neck of a Giraffe, \n
How many LPGA pros from this country spoke up on the others behalf? \n
Do what the men’s tour did, improve the quality of your game, \n
Does it bring any excitement with the boring same old same? \n
Ladies it’s time to speak up and proudly declare, “Yes we can! ” \n
Whether it’s Sweeden, South America, Korea, China or Japan. \n
Flash! Ladies Golf recinded, public opinion has changed its mind, \n
It only shows things don’t always improve or get better with time, \n
Neither the Asians or any other nationality is killing the LPGA tour, \n
Just incompetent front office decisions made behind a closed door. \n<|endoftext|>

life \n
The more we live, more brief appear \n
Our life's succeeding stages; \n
A day to childhood seems a year, \n
And years like passing ages. \n
The gladsome current of our youth, \n
Ere passion yet disorders, \n
Steals lingering like a river smooth \n
Along its grassy borders. \n
But as the careworn cheek grows wan, \n
And sorrow's shafts fly thicker, \n
Ye stars, that measure life to man, \n
Why seem your courses quicker? \n
When joys have lost their bloom and breath, \n
And life itself is vapid, \n
Why, as we reach the Falls of Death \n
Feel we its tide more rapid? \n
It may be strange—yet who would change \n
Time's course to slower speeding, \n
When one by one our friends have gone, \n
And left our bosoms bleeding? \n
Heaven gives our years of fading strength \n
Indemnifying fleetness; \n
And those of youth, a seeming length, \n
Proportion'd to their sweetness. \n<|endoftext|>
life \n
TO THE HONOURED MR ENDYMION PORTER, GROOM OF \n
THE BED-CHAMBER TO HIS MAJESTY \n
Sweet country life, to such unknown, \n
Whose lives are others', not their own! \n
But serving courts and cities, be \n
Less happy, less enjoying thee. \n
Thou never plough'st the ocean's foam \n
To seek and bring rough pepper home: \n
Nor to the Eastern Ind dost rove \n
To bring from thence the scorched clove: \n
Nor, with the loss of thy loved rest, \n
Bring'st home the ingot from the West. \n
No, thy ambition's master-piece \n
Flies no thought higher than a fleece: \n
Or how to pay thy hinds, and clear \n
All scores: and so to end the year: \n
But walk'st about thine own dear bounds, \n
Not envying others' larger grounds: \n
For well thou know'st, 'tis not th' extent \n
Of land makes life, but sweet content. \n
When now the cock (the ploughman's horn) \n
Calls forth the lily-wristed morn; \n
Then to thy corn-fields thou dost go, \n
Which though well soil'd, yet thou dost know \n
That the best compost for the lands \n
Is the wise master's feet, and hands. \n
There at the plough thou find'st thy team, \n
With a hind whistling there to them: \n
And cheer'st them up, by singing how \n
The kingdom's portion is the plough. \n
This done, then to th' enamell'd meads \n
Thou go'st; and as thy foot there treads, \n
Thou seest a present God-like power \n
Imprinted in each herb and flower: \n
And smell'st the breath of great-eyed kine, \n
Sweet as the blossoms of the vine. \n
Here thou behold'st thy large sleek neat \n
Unto the dew-laps up in meat: \n
And, as thou look'st, the wanton steer, \n
The heifer, cow, and ox draw near, \n
To make a pleasing pastime there. \n
These seen, thou go'st to view thy flocks \n
Of sheep, safe from the wolf and fox, \n
And find'st their bellies there as full \n
Of short sweet grass, as backs with wool: \n
And leav'st them, as they feed and fill, \n
A shepherd piping on a hill. \n
For sports, for pageantry, and plays, \n
Thou hast thy eves, and holydays: \n
On which the young men and maids meet, \n
To exercise their dancing feet: \n
Tripping the comely country Round, \n
With daffadils and daisies crown'd. \n
Thy wakes, thy quintels, here thou hast, \n
Thy May-poles too with garlands graced; \n
Thy Morris-dance; thy Whitsun-ale; \n
Thy shearing-feast, which never fail. \n
Thy harvest home; thy wassail bowl, \n
That's toss'd up after Fox i' th' hole: \n
Thy mummeries; thy Twelve-tide kings \n
And queens; thy Christmas revellings: \n
Thy nut-brown mirth, thy russet wit, \n
And no man pays too dear for it.-- \n
To these, thou hast thy times to go \n
And trace the hare i' th' treacherous snow: \n
Thy witty wiles to draw, and get \n
The lark into the trammel net: \n
Thou hast thy cockrood, and thy glade \n
To take the precious pheasant made: \n
Thy lime-twigs, snares, and pit-falls then \n
To catch the pilfering birds, not men. \n
--O happy life! if that their good \n
The husbandmen but understood! \n
Who all the day themselves do please, \n
And younglings, with such sports as these: \n
And lying down, have nought t' affright \n
Sweet Sleep, that makes more short the night. \n

Who held the end was Death. He opens eyes \n
Slowly, to one long livid oozing plain \n
Closed down by the strange eyeless heavens. He lies; \n
And waits; and once in timeless sick surmise \n
Through the dead air heaves up an unknown hand, \n
Like a dry branch. No life is in that land, \n
Himself not lives, but is a thing that cries; \n
An unmeaning point upon the mud; a speck \n
Of moveless horror; an Immortal One \n
Cleansed of the world, sentient and dead; a fly \n
Fast-stuck in grey sweat on a corpse's neck. \n
I thought when love for you died, I should die. \n
It's dead. Alone, most strangely, I live on. \n<|endoftext|>

No fear of death and you will not mind. \n

In your toil, in your triumphs and in your fears. \n
Just enjoy the journey without looking back \n
Savour the senses and you will not lack. \n
Truth is more in the process than the result \n
Liberates you from thought and you can exult \n

Life is life, even though it’s tough, \n
You gotta live with it, even though it’s rough. \n
It’s a gift, given to us from up above, \n
So don’t use it for hatred, but use it for love. \n
Life is the most precious, and valuable gift of all, \n
So don’t throw it away, by jumping of a wall. \n
I know it myself, life can be hard, \n
So if your looking for help, just speak to God. \n
Life’s of too great value to be thrown away, \n
So thank God for letting you live – every, single day. \n
It doesn’t matter if you’re a boy or a girl, \n
No matter how you kill yourself, you’ve got a date with Lucifer. \n
You never know when your life will come to an end, \n
So live your life happily, get a family, and a best friend. \n
Would you rather have lovely granddaughters, and grandsons? , \n
Or kill yourself now, and burn in hell when Dooms day comes. \n
Live everyday as if it would be your last, \n
Be kind, happy, and have a blast. \n

life \n
Words beaten out of the frozen mouth are never remembered. \n
Memories as lovely as the moment when all sunflowers spring out in summer luxury are always thrown back into our knowledge luggage. \n
Songs are never remembered for a lifetime but memorised for sometime. \n
Money never stays behind but the reputation and the name that you carry as your prestige always sits near your doorstep as a welcome mat until death. \n
Love pulses your nerves and picks at your soul reminding you of the sorrows that your life holds at as a burden. \n
Your eye blinks at every note the wind peaks, \n
Your ear reacts to every sound that echoes and picks on your drum, \n
Your nose rubs the scent, aura and dust filled within the air, \n
Your heart bats, every second or so, your red-rose blood around your body, \n
Your limbs groove at every step that you are made to craft. \n
But all these die out with fun when all your senses are blinded and when you enter the most valuable place on earth, where there are unfulfilled dreams, desires and aims… \n
When light all around you dies out, only your soul leads you to the right direction. \n
The only reality is- beginning- middle- end- and then comes the freedom of your enslaved soul when it breaks through those bars of your beautiful but unreal body! \n<|endoftext|>

life \n
Meera was in the temple, \n
Along with common people, \n
Who also sang with her \n
Closely following her. \n
Her every divine song, \n
All the rural folks sang. \n
Thus these songs became \n
Popular in course of time. \n
Rana failed to bring her \n
To the family life forever. \n
His mother felt it a disgrace \n
To the entire Rajputs race. \n
His disgruntled widow-sister \n
And hard hearted mother, \n
Plotted against Meera then \n
To kill her with cobra poison. \n
A cup of milk with poison, \n
They gave her one fine morn, \n
In the temple, when she was \n
Alone offering her prayers. \n
It was poison, she knew well, \n
But she drank the cup full. \n
And continued her prayers. \n
What a surprise it was! \n
It didn’t act on Meera. \n
But the face of Krishna \n
At Dwaraka turned blue \n
Suddenly with no clue. \n
As an unexpected miracle, \n
The doors of the temple, \n
Both got themselves shut \n
And stuck up too tight. \n
As if nothing had happened, \n
Before Krishna she remained. \n
Her in-laws were desperate, \n
As even poison didn’t act. \n
Devotees from all corners \n
Rushed there to see her, \n
And the crowd was so thick \n
It threw also some risk. \n
Spies dressed like sadhus \n
Studied the strategic points \n
Thus weakening the position \n
On the defensive front-line. \n
One day two sadhus came \n
And gave Meera that time \n
A pearl chain as a gift \n
Which she did accept. \n
To Krishna she offered it, \n
The one that was a gift, \n
To the war-captive Allaudin, \n
When he was given a pardon. \n
Rana released him gracefully, \n
On an agreement mutually, \n
Offering him this chain, \n
Just a gift, as a token. \n
When the same chain \n
To Rana was shown, \n
He got terribly wild, \n
That he was being spied. \n
Immediately he ordered \n
The temple be destroyed \n
Which brought this crisis \n
To the very palace doors. \n
Devotees, not even a single, \n
Came out of the temple. \n
Even the elephants sent \n
To break, back they all went. \n
No damage could be done \n
To the temple or anyone. \n
For this incapable blame, \n
Too wild Rana became. \n
He sent cobras to bite her. \n
They did no damage to her. \n
As disgrace only she brought. \n
She was a witch, he thought. \n
Meera blamed only Krishna, \n
For changing the mind of Rana, \n
Who was so nice to her earlier \n

And so my poem begins as life as lower class \n
waking up to see the clouds dark and the summers cold \n
wishing to change wishing to make a difference \n
but i have nothing in life not even anything \n
admiring those will all and those with any \n
how it feels being someone with nothing at all \n<|endoftext|>
life \n
Death no wonder \n
its endless inferiority \n
known to us all \n
wonder is life \n
because we yet not know \n
the possibilities \n
yet to be exposed \n
death now simply a station \n
where a stop will blot a presence \n
but life shows fights \n
colorful its ignition \n
Wonder \n
wonderful \n
ambitious much to get \n
thousand times to taste life \n
infinite and endless... \n

★This Life This Life I Cannot Leave You Again \n
☆Luo Zhihai Lyrics and Translation \n
Where did your form appear? \n
On the golden seawall shone sunlight. \n
Carrying a packsack and seeking for you. \n
We were interesting to enjoy sunset and tide. \n
Rain poured down and wind raged. \n
Waves turned up and down and thunders from the sky. \n
Sailing side by side I snuggled with you. \n
Until pushing clouds and bringing to light. \n
Where did your steps climb and cross? \n
Jungle faint and mountain paths wound \n
By your gun, a wild boar was shot. \n
I caught up seeing that with my eyes. \n
Forest over the thorns and moss. \n
Wore enough clothes and opened your big eyes. \n
Listened to birds singing saying goodbye. \n
We were out of the jungle back to life. \n
Looking for your footprints with my dream. \n
Write our love in diaries at night. \n
Singing with karaoke and MP4. \n
Make love together in happy time. \n
Enjoy games and dancing every day. \n
Good mood, beautiful scene every day. \n
No matter where you go long distances. \n
This life this life I cannot leave you again. \n

life \n
Being released from the womb of a woman \n
We walk towards another \n
To be chained again \n
None is dependable \n
None is lovable \n
Life is a coplex road \n
Walls, stones, mud, water... \n
Life is a groaning running through \n
Graveyards \n
Free, imprisioned \n
Imprisioned, free \n
Only a desire weeping alone in solitude \n
Life is just like life with no comparison \n<|endoftext|>

What did I do \n
that I had to \n
choose between two loves? \n
Why did I choose \n
knowing I'd lose \n
affections thereof? \n
Who had made you \n
feel all was through \n
with my choice hereof? \n
When did you know \n
that you would go \n
if I chose Above? \n
Where would one be \n
without Life's Tree \n
and His Holy Dove? \n

Happy he who like Ulysses \n
Happy he who like Ulysses has returned \n
successful from his travels, or like he \n
who sought the Golden Fleece, to rest well earned - \n
wise to the world - amongst his family. \n
When shall I see again my place of birth, \n
its chimney smoke, and at what time of year, \n
when seen that little, modest, plot of earth \n
which means far more to me than I draw here. \n
I’m drawn far more to my ancestral home \n
than to a Roman palace fine and proud, \n
prefer fine slate to marble, rather roam \n
along the Loire than sport midst Tiber’s crowd. \n
My Liré I prefer to Palatine, \n
and to sea air, soft climate Angevine. \n

Heureux qui, comme Ulysse, a fait un beau voyage \n
Ou comme celui là qui conquit la toison, \n
Et puis est retourné, plein d’usage et raison, \n

Quand reverrai-je, hélas, de mon petit village \n
Fumer la cheminée: et en quelle saison \n
Reverrai-je le clos de ma pauvre maison, \n
Qui m’est une province, et beaucoup d’avantage! \n
Plus me plaît le séjour qu’ont bâti mes ayeux, \n
Que des palais Romains le front audacieux: \n
Plus que le marbre dur me plaît l’ardoise fine, \n
Plus mon Loire Gaulois que le Tibre Latin, \n
Plus mon petit Liré que le mont Palatin, \n
Et plus que l’air marin la douceur Angevine. \n
Joachim du Bellay 1515_1560 \n
Triste Qui, Comme Charles \n
Triste qui, comme Charles, a fait un beau mariage, \n
Et qui donc une fois conquise la toison, \n
Se retrouve chez soi, plein d’usage et raison, \n
Vivre entre ses parents le reste de son âge! \n
Quand donc reverra-t-il, sans ce remue-ménage \n
Fumer sa cheminée: et en quelle saison \n
Reverra-t-il le clos de Windsor et d’Eton, \n
Qui lui est royaume uni, et beaucoup d’avantages! \n
Plus lui plaît le séjour qu’ont bâti ses aïeux, \n
Que la face à Diane à[f]front audacieux: \n
Le palais brûlé - dur! - plaît plus qu’ardoise indigne, \n
Plus son livre Gallois que perdre son Latin, \n
Plus ses délires et rêves que le mont Vénusien, \n
Et plus que l’air malin la douceur Camilline. \n

Happy as the Cock \n
Happy proud rooster who has travelled far \n
Across life's stream with hens in indian file, \n
Preened white, red comb, and walked the gangplank trial \n
Penned in terse lines that verse bright humour's star. \n
Yearning for home, who roamed, to pen they are, \n
Assured of rest, returning, strut in style, \n
Say best nest eggs they'll lay, loud crow awhile. \n
Triumphant cock-a-doodle echoes jar \n
Hard-hearted humans who aren't up to par, \n
Eggs daily may not lay, nor soar mobile, \n
Current carried, fair through air agile, \n
Or cluck like duck to woodchuck. Men, bizarre, \n
Chuckle they are born to lead, indeed \n
Know not lead rots hot head, heads for poor breed! \n

happy \n
Into the rose gold westland, its yellow prairies roll, \n
World of the bison's freedom, home of the Indian's soul. \n
Roll out, O seas! in sunlight bathed, \n
Your plains wind-tossed, and grass enswathed. \n
Farther than vision ranges, farther than eagles fly, \n
Stretches the land of beauty, arches the perfect sky, \n
Hemm'd through the purple mists afar \n
By peaks that gleam like star on star. \n
Fringing the prairie billows, fretting horizon's line, \n
Darkly green are slumb'ring wildernesses of pine, \n
Sleeping until the zephyrs throng \n
To kiss their silence into song. \n
Whispers freighted with odour swinging into the air, \n
Russet needles as censers swing to an altar, where \n
The angels' songs are less divine \n
Than duo sung twixt breeze and pine. \n
Laughing into the forest, dimples a mountain stream, \n
Pure as the airs above it, soft as a summer dream, \n
O! Lethean spring thou'rt only found \n
Within this ideal hunting ground. \n
Surely the great Hereafter cannot be more than this, \n
Surely we'll see that country after Time's farewell kiss. \n
Who would his lovely faith condole? \n
Who envies not the Red-skin's soul, \n
Sailing into the cloud land, sailing into the sun, \n
Into the crimson portals ajar when life is done? \n
O! dear dead race, my spirit too \n
Would fain sail westward unto you. \n<|endoftext|>

The strong-girl of our home! \n
She did the hardest chores; \n
And helped mother at work, \n
And locked the house’s doors. \n
She was a simple dame; \n
But received all the blame; \n
She yearned for love and name; \n
Life played a cruel game! \n
She loved to talk her heart, \n
And learned on own some art; \n
Unlucky on her part, \n
She remains right from start. \n
She is an Aquarian; \n
Devoted Marian; \n
She leads a spinster’s life, \n
Alone, amidst much strife. \n
May God bless my sister, \n
On her birthday today! \n
And grant her will-power \n
To walk in Heaven’s way. \n

The happy life be these, I find:-- \n
The richesse left, not got with pain; \n
The fruitful ground, the quiet mind; \n
The equal friend; no grudge, no strife; \n
No charge of rule, nor governance; \n
Without disease, the healthful life; \n
The household of continuance; \n
The mean diet, no delicate fare; \n
True wisdom join'd with simpleness; \n
The night discharged of all care, \n
Where wine the wit may not oppress. \n
The faithful wife, without debate; \n
Such sleeps as may beguile the night: \n
Contented with thine own estate \n
Ne wish for death, ne fear his might. \n<|endoftext|>

A limerick dedicated to HRH Prince Leonard, * for his 79th Birthday. \n
A VERY HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DEAR PRINCE LEONARD! ! ! ! \n
There once was a farmer named Leonard, \n
quite a thinker and very well-mannered. \n
When they wanted his money \n
he found this not funny \n
and quickly became PRINCE Leonard. \n
And established a souvereign state, \n
without fuss or a lengthy debate. \n
as the world held its breath: \n
‘would he fight to the death? ’ \n
Or default and accept his fate? \n
So, it quickly became quite clear \n
that the Prince did not recognize fear. \n
Although high were the stakes \n
he quite had what it takes \n
and knew that vict’ry was near. \n
Then they threatened to come out in force, \n
to destroy this disgrace at its source. \n
By the end of the season \n
they would punish his treason \n
and undo this unlawful divorce. \n
“You will cease and desist”, they declared, \n
and in parliament tempers flared. \n
“You must lay down your weapon \n
lest dreadful things happen, \n
our country is owned, NEVER shared! ” \n
Yet Prince Leonard had needed no guns, \n
(a principle taught to his sons) . \n
‘twas abundantly plain \n
he had used his brain \n
to stand up to these modern day Huns. \n
So the stand-off continued unchanged, \n
with negotiations arranged. \n
People asked how one could \n
imitate Robin Hood, \n
(there was talk that this man was deranged) . \n
And the tabloids predicted defeat. \n
Told the man to return to his wheat. \n
Or this farmer of dirt \n
would most surely get hurt. \n
That this power he’d never beat. \n
Well three decades have passed at HUTT, \n
and its borders have never been shut. \n
Diplomatic relations \n
with many nations \n
are the future – and treason it’s NOT. \n
Now, the country called HRPP \n
is alive, independent and free. \n
Only once did it seem \n
an impossible dream \n
of a man who’s determined to be. \n
So what makes this story unique? \n
Is it showing the strong versus weak? \n
For, to simply secede \n
-an astonishing deed- \n
it belongs to a different league. \n
Well, I’m nearing the end of this story, \n
of freedom and courage and glory. \n
Don’t you wish that you had \n
as much guts as this lad, \n
he succeeded and never was sorry. \n
Just some parting words and the conclusion \n
‘bout a place of resplendent seclusion. \n
Me? -I like what I see! \n
It’s the place to be. \n
And, most certainly not an illusion. \n
On a map it is only a sliver. \n
To the pollies? It makes them shiver! \n
But wherever you are \n
it never seems far: \n
Our beautiful, precious Hutt River. \n

Happy the souls to Jesus joined, \n
And saved by grace alone, \n
Walking in all his ways they find \n
Their heaven on earth begun. \n
The church triumphant in thy love, \n
Their mighty joys we know; \n
They sing the Lamb in hymns above, \n
And we in hymns below. \n
Thee in thy glorious realm they praise, \n
And bow before thy throne, \n
We in the kingdom of thy grace: \n
The kingdoms are but one. \n
The holy to the holiest leads, \n
From thence our spirits rise, \n
And he that in thy statutes treads \n
Shall meet thee in the skies. \n<|endoftext|>
happy \n
And soon \n
we'll meet again, \n
old man. \n
Me, bearing flowers, \n
chaperoned by \n
one sweet niece, \n
'to show the ropes' \n
to me, the stranger. \n
And water things. \n
You, in the ground \n
since that cold day \n
in March, \n
with snow \n
still in the hills. \n
Your hills \n
where you meandered, \n
chased after that \n
psychopathic dog, \n
while reminiscing \n
over notable \n
advantages, \n
most imagined, \n
of long-gone days. \n
And of this, \n
the new world, \n
made entirely \n
for others. \n
Yet, you took pride \n
in always doing \n
your best \n
in any circumstance. \n
'Some day, \n
you said, \n
I'll be six feet under', \n
yeah, \n
and watching, \n
also judging, \n
maybe praising \n
surely condemning, \n
only the role \n
of executioner \n
to be denied. \n
That day did come. \n
You were prepared \n
of course. \n
The moment that \n
you closed \n
the final book, \n
and the last journal \n
where you had searched \n
with urgency \n
and all your brilliance, \n
for one more cure. \n
The one that would, \n
though hard to find, \n
be carrying your name. \n
When you were beaten \n
you would nod, \n
as if to say \n
'the subject's closed', \n
that's what you did. \n
As to the rest of us, \n
those left, \n
we were perplexed \n
and short of words, \n
of clever thoughts. \n
And were expected \n
(and observed) \n
to show appropriate \n
behaviour, \n
like grief \n
and talent \n
of an organising spirit. \n
Which, being in a \n
niche of status \n
in a society, \n
stitched and \n
held together \n
by musty remnants \n
of our everlasting \n
bourgeoisie. \n
We did. \n
This time, old man \n
I want to warn you \n
in advance \n
with unaccustomed \n
and antipodean-like \n
courtesy, \n
there will be little \n
if any \n
conversation. \n
What, with the kid, \n
she'd be so \n
ill-prepared \n
and might get \n
traumatised. \n
In any case, \n
we said our piece \n
last visit, \n
surely you remember, \n
it's when I asked \n
if you were comfy \n
in that hole, \n
hopefully not cold. \n
Not much to add this time, \n
though here is one, \n
a thought \n
to cheer you up, \n
I know it will, \n
you've had one \n
Father's Day already, \n
and I, respectful son, \n
who lives in \n
a Down Under \n
that's still above \n
the ground \n
(what a pun, sorry) , \n
brings you another one, \n
a different date \n
from different worlds. \n
Thus you get two \n
just for the price of one. \n
So, I must close now. \n
My plane is leaving, \n
soon, too soon perhaps, \n
just wanted you to know \n
that I'll be there \n
to say Hello and \n
Happy Father's Day. \n
'Til then, \n
from man to man, \n
I send respect \n
to you, while going \n
back in time \n
to very early \n
memories. \n<|endoftext|>

Oh, come with me to the Happy Isles \n
In the golden haze off yonder, \n
Where the song of the sun-kissed breeze beguiles, \n
And the ocean loves to wander. \n
Fragrant the vines that mantle those hills, \n
Proudly the fig rejoices; \n
Merrily dance the virgin rills, \n
Blending their myriad voices. \n
Our herds shall fear no evil there, \n
But peacefully feed and rest them; \n
Neither shall serpent nor prowling bear \n
Ever come there to molest them. \n
Neither shall Eurus, wanton bold, \n
Nor feverish drouth distress us, \n
But he that compasseth heat and cold \n
Shall temper them both to bless us. \n
There no vandal foot has trod, \n
And the pirate hosts that wander \n
Shall never profane the sacred sod \n
Of those beautiful Isles out yonder. \n
Never a spell shall blight our vines, \n
Nor Sirius blaze above us, \n
But you and I shall drink our wines \n
And sing to the loved that love us. \n
So come with me where Fortune smiles \n
And the gods invite devotion,-- \n
Oh, come with me to the Happy Isles \n
In the haze of that far-off ocean! \n<|endoftext|>

Love is here, just in time \n
my dark world has begun to shine \n
wherever i go, i want her near \n
cause she's what makes me happy \n
How long will this love last? \n
still can't believe she's mine \n
So attractive with a past so tragic \n
i'll do anything for her just as long as she's happy \n
She seems to hold and kiss me less \n
i feel so cold, her lips are blessed \n
i hope she never strays from me \n
she's what keeps me happy \n
She wants to free, it's in her eyes \n
Away from me, let her decide \n
an eclipse is what she sees in mine \n
cause love has made me happy \n
Then came the day, i lost my heart \n
she's gone away, forever we part \n
I find myself back in the dark \n
where nobody can be happy \n
I would hold you in my arms \n
No other hand in my palms \n
i thought the love of ours would last \n
she wants me to be happy \n
Forget about me \n
life has been tragic \n
im'a wait in the rain for you \n
just to see you happy \n
I'm stuck in a world where demons grab me \n
They stab me \n
...but im'a wait in the rain for you \n
As long as you're happy \n<|endoftext|>

Happy is England! I could be content \n
To see no other verdure than its own; \n
To feel no other breezes than are blown \n
Through its tall woods with high romances blent: \n
Yet do I sometimes feel a languishment \n
For skies Italian, and an inward groan \n
To sit upon an Alp as on a throne, \n
And half forget what world or worldling meant. \n
Happy is England, sweet her artless daughters; \n
Enough their simple loveliness for me, \n
Enough their whitest arms in silence clinging: \n
Yet do I often warmly burn to see \n
Beauties of deeper glance, and hear their singing, \n
And float with them about the summer waters. \n<|endoftext|>

beach \n
We went to the beach to get wind in our hair \n
to stand on the sand and simply to stare. \n
To let the surf tickle toes and dampen our clothes \n
as we played 'run away' \n
from the wavelets at play. \n
We went to the beach to climb on the rocks \n
find cool shallow pools where we'd take of our socks, \n
and peer in the waters to see what we might find \n
that the waves of the sea, \n
had last left behind. \n
We went to the beach to find coloured shells \n
the kind that when placed to our ears \n
make the sound of the ocean appear, \n
and gathered rocks that we never would find \n
in the places we walked, \n
for most of the time. \n
We went to the beach and all that, we did find \n
and the smell of the salt refreshed our tired minds. \n
I'll never forget the laughter and sounds \n
and the freedom to run, \n
on that wet sandy ground. \n
We went to the beach my family and I \n
and there we were one, \n
with the ocean, the beach, and the sky. \n<|endoftext|>

An umbrella being dragged at the day's end. \n
A seagull churns its wings, \n
avoiding sunlight, \n
the hard flight of Icarus. \n
Pink swimsuits blown in the wind, \n
in search of due course. \n
Time is needy, a bronzed babe walks by, a regular \n
statue of Liberty, her flesh turning to \n
green palor as the water cools. \n
In this empty beach dream of deepening sky, \n
the wet Kremlin and White House \n
are eroded as our childless hopes. \n
An old woman collects \n
seashells-caverns of poverty \n
to be sold to our deaf ears. \n
The ocean roars of stolen property. \n<|endoftext|>

ON the beach, at night, \n
Stands a child, with her father, \n
Watching the east, the autumn sky. \n
Up through the darkness, \n
While ravening clouds, the burial clouds, in black masses spreading, \n
Lower, sullen and fast, athwart and down the sky, \n
Amid a transparent clear belt of ether yet left in the east, \n
Ascends, large and calm, the lord-star Jupiter; \n
And nigh at hand, only a very little above, \n
Swim the delicate brothers, the Pleiades. 10 \n
From the beach, the child, holding the hand of her father, \n
Those burial-clouds that lower, victorious, soon to devour all, \n
Watching, silently weeps. \n
Weep not, child, \n
Weep not, my darling, \n
With these kisses let me remove your tears; \n
The ravening clouds shall not long be victorious, \n
They shall not long possess the sky- shall devour the stars only in \n
apparition: \n
Jupiter shall emerge- be patient- watch again another night- the \n
Pleiades shall emerge, \n
They are immortal- all those stars, both silvery and golden, shall \n
shine out again, 20 \n
The great stars and the little ones shall shine out again- they \n
endure; \n
The vast immortal suns, and the long-enduring pensive moons, shall \n
again shine. \n
Then, dearest child, mournest thou only for Jupiter? \n
Considerest thou alone the burial of the stars? \n
Something there is, \n
(With my lips soothing thee, adding, I whisper, \n
I give thee the first suggestion, the problem and indirection,) \n
Something there is more immortal even than the stars, \n
(Many the burials, many the days and nights, passing away,) \n
Something that shall endure longer even than lustrous Jupiter, 30 \n
Longer than sun, or any revolving satellite, \n
Or the radiant brothers, the Pleiades. \n<|endoftext|>

something is caught, \n

The beach is wiped clear \n

of the high tide, \n

Early one evening \n
I caught the lore \n
Of the fresh air \n
From the calm sea shore \n
I crept out of bed \n
Then out of the house \n
I made not a sound \n
Just like a mouse \n
I walked down the path \n
On to the sand \n
Loving the sea \n
And the layer of the land \n
I walked to the water \n
My feet felt it splash \n
I listen to the birds \n
And the waves crash \n
I looked in the distance \n
The suns going down \n
I backed from the water \n
And sat on the ground \n
The skies changing colors \n
From purple violet to red \n
I sat back resting \n
Relaxing my head \n
The sky continued to change \n
Every color shades \n
Every color bright and vivid \n
Not a one cascades \n
Orange yellow white \n
To gray \n
Theses beautiful colors \n
End another day \n
I watch the night \n
Slowly enter \n
Feeling as though \n
I’m in the center \n
I feel relaxed \n
Fully at peace \n
Watching the night \n
Fully increase \n
The colors are gone \n
The night is now black \n
I can’t wait till tomorrow \n
When the colors come back \n
I lay there awhile \n
Then get up and start walking \n
Stars shining bright \n
The crickets now talking \n
Of the sun setting colors I think \n
As I lay back in my bed \n
Their beauty their shade and their life \n
All relaxing inside of my head \n<|endoftext|>

I saw from the beach, when the morning was shining, \n
A bark o'er the waters move gloriously on; \n
I came when the sun o'er that beach was declining, \n
The bark was still there, but the waters were gone. \n
And such is the fate of our life's early promise, \n
So passing the spring-tide of joy we have known; \n
Each wave that we danced on at morning ebbs from us, \n
And leaves us, at eve, on the bleak shore alone. \n
Oh, who would not welcome that moment's returning \n
When passion first waked a new life through his frame, \n
And his soul, like the wood that grows precious in burning, \n
Gave out all its sweets to love's exquisite flame. \n<|endoftext|>

We would climb the highest dune, \n
from there to gaze and come down: \n
the ocean was performing; \n
we contributed our climb. \n
Waves leapfrogged and came \n
straight out of the storm. \n
What should our gaze mean? \n
Kit waited for me to decide. \n
Standing on such a hill, \n
what would you tell your child? \n
That was an absolute vista. \n
Those waves raced far, and cold. \n
'How far could you swim, Daddy, \n
in such a storm?' \n
'As far as was needed,' I said, \n
and as I talked, I swam. \n<|endoftext|>

On A Far Away Beach At Dawn \n
Your face is etched in the stars that dot a sky about to lose its black \n
Mirrored as a reflection on a luminous sheet of sea at low tide \n
The image skittered like sand pipers dissolving as the first rays \n
Of an impatient sun scattered light on the slate gray sand \n
A harsh westerly blew to shore and slapped my face \n
Assails my nose with the briny redolence of shoreline waste \n
From afar clam diggers sat on empty pails digging and \n
Poking with bamboo spatulas the water logged sand \n
I heard your voice mingle with the twittering of the shore birds \n
As they skipped and darted leaving their v marks on the glistening sand \n
I thought of my easy chair, my garden, I thought of your smile...of home \n
A harsh westerly slapped my face, a briny redolence assailed my nose. \n<|endoftext|>

In retrospect the tragic nature \n
of sea is a taste wept too daily, \n
too depleted by freedom's rupture; \n
the eyes have other secrets to see \n
and deeper use for the detritus \n
within us: the bright effluvium \n
of ego dries up, mired as it is \n
in wealth, that remedial medium. \n
Blame it on fate, on beach memories-- \n
pebble put in the pocket or shell \n
fragments; any memento carries \n
us as much as we it. Time capsule \n
contains every evening's interval. \n

"Tie stille, barn min! \n
Imorgen kommer Fin, \n
Fa'er din, \n
Og gi'er dich Esbern Snares öine og hjerte at lege med!" \n
Zealand Rhyme. \n
"BUILD at Kallundborg by the sea \n
A church as stately as church may be, \n
And there shalt thou wed my daughter fair," \n
Said the Lord of Nesvek to Esbern Snare. \n
And the Baron laughed. But Esbern said, \n
"Though I lose my soul, I will Helva wed!" \n
And off he strode, in his pride of will, \n
To the Troll who dwelt in Ulshoi hill. \n
"Build, O Troll, a church for me \n
At Kallundborg by the mighty sea; \n
Build it stately, and build it fair, \n
Build it quickly," said Esbern Snare. \n
But the sly Dwarf said, "No work is wrought \n
By Trolls of the Hills, O man, for naught. \n
What wilt thou give for thy church so fair?" \n
"Set thy own price," quoth Esbern Snare. \n
"When Kallundborg church is builded well, \n
Thou must the name of its builder tell, \n
Or thy heart and thy eyes must be my boon." \n
"Build," said Esbern, "and build it soon." \n
By night and by day the Troll wrought on; \n
He hewed the timbers, he piled the stone; \n
But day by day, as the walls rose fair, \n
Darker and sadder grew Esbern Snare. \n
He listened by night, he watched by day, \n
He sought and thought, but he dared not pray; \n
In vain he called on the Elle-maids shy, \n
And the Neck and the Nis gave no reply. \n
Of his evil bargain far and wide \n
A rumor ran through the country-side; \n
And Helva of Nesvek, young and fair, \n
Prayed for the soul of Esbern Snare. \n
And now the church was wellnigh done; \n
One pillar it lacked, and one alone; \n
And the grim Troll muttered, "Fool thou art! \n
To-morrow gives me thy eyes and heart!" \n
By Kallundborg in black despair, \n
Through wood and meadow, walked Esbern Snare, \n
Till, worn and weary, the strong man sank \n
Under the birches on Ulshoi bank. \n
At his last day's work he heard the Troll \n
Hammer and delve in the quarry's hole; \n
Before him the church stood large and fair: \n
"I have builded my tomb," said Esbern Snare. \n
And he closed his eyes the sight to hide, \n
When he heard a light step at his side: \n
"O Esbern Snare! a sweet voice said, \n
"Would I might die now in thy stead!" \n
With a grasp by love and by fear made strong, \n
He held her fast, and he held her long; \n
With the beating heart of a bird afeard, \n
She hid her face in his flame-red beard. \n
"O love!" he cried, "let me look to-day \n
In thine eyes ere mine are plucked away; \n
Let me hold thee close, let me feel thy heart \n
Ere mine by the Troll is torn apart! \n
"I sinned, O Helva, for love of thee! \n
Pray that the Lord Christ pardon me!" \n
But fast as she prayed, and faster still, \n
Hammered the Troll in Ulshoi hill. \n
He knew, as he wrought, that a loving heart \n
Was somehow baffling his evil art; \n
For more than spell of Elf or Troll \n
Is a maiden's prayer for her lover's soul. \n
And Esbern listened, and caught the sound \n
Of a Troll-wife singing underground: \n
"To-morrow comes Fine, father thine: \n
Lie still and hush thee, baby mine! \n
"Lie still, my darling! next sunrise \n
Thou'lt play with Esbern Snare's heart and eyes!" \n
"Ho! ho!" quoth Esbern, "is that your game? \n
Thanks to the Troll-wife, I know his name!" \n
The Troll he heard him, and hurried on \n
To Kallundborg church with the lacking stone. \n
"Too late, Gaffer Fine!" cried Esbern Snare; \n
And Troll and pillar vanished in air! \n
That night the harvesters heard the sound \n
Of a woman sobbing underground, \n
And the voice of the Hill-Troll loud with blame \n
Of the careless singer who told his name. \n
Of the Troll of the Church they sing the rune \n
By the Northern Sea in the harvest moon; \n
And the fishers of Zealand hear him still \n
Scolding his wife in Ulshoi hill. \n
And seaward over its groves of birch \n
Still looks the tower of Kallundborg church \n
Where, first at its altar, a wedded pair, \n
Stood Helva of Nesvek and Esbern Snare! \n<|endoftext|>

IT was the calm and silent night! \n
Seven hundred years and fifty-three \n
Had Rome been growing up to might, \n
And now was Queen of land and sea. \n
No sound was heard of clashing wars; \n
Peace brooded o’er the hush’d domain; \n
Apollo, Pallas, Jove and Mars, \n
Held undisturb’d their ancient reign, \n
In the solemn midnight \n
Centuries ago. \n
’T was in the calm and silent night! \n
The senator of haughty Rome \n
Impatient urged his chariot’s flight, \n
From lordly revel rolling home. \n
Triumphal arches gleaming swell \n
His breast with thoughts of boundless sway; \n
What reck’d the Roman what befell \n
A paltry province far away, \n
In the solemn midnight \n
Centuries ago! \n
Within that province far away \n
Went plodding home a weary boor: \n
A streak of light before him lay, \n
Fall’n through a half-shut stable door \n
Across his path. He pass’d—for nought \n
Told what was going on within; \n
How keen the stars! his only thought; \n
The air how calm and cold and thin, \n
In the solemn midnight \n
Centuries ago! \n
O strange indifference!—low and high \n
Drows’d over common joys and cares: \n
The earth was still—but knew not why; \n
The world was listening—unawares. \n
How calm a moment may precede \n
One that shall thrill the world for ever! \n
To that still moment none would heed, \n
Man’s doom was link’d, no more to sever, \n
In the solemn midnight \n
Centuries ago. \n
It is the calm and solemn night! \n
A thousand bells ring out, and throw \n
Their joyous peals abroad, and smite \n
The darkness, charm’d and holy now. \n
The night that erst no name had worn, \n
To it a happy name is given; \n
For in that stable lay new-born \n
The peaceful Prince of Earth and Heaven, \n
In the solemn midnight \n
Centuries ago. \n<|endoftext|>

But if they'd give us toys and twice the stuff most \n
parents splurge on the average kid, orphans, I submit, need more than enough; \n
in fact, stacks wrapped with our names nearly hid \n

I knew exactly what it was I missed as we were lined up number rank and file: \n

christmas \n
A farmer's wife, both young and gay, \n
And fresh as op'ning buds of May; \n
Had taken to herself, a Spouse, \n
And plighted many solemn vows, \n
That she a faithful mate would prove, \n
In meekness, duty, and in love! \n
That she, despising joy and wealth, \n
Would be, in sickness and in health, \n
His only comfort and his Friend-- \n
But, mark the sequel,--and attend! \n
This Farmer, as the tale is told-- \n
Was somewhat cross, and somewhat old! \n
His, was the wintry hour of life, \n
While summer smiled before his wife; \n
A contrast, rather form'd to cloy \n
The zest of matrimonial joy! \n
'Twas Christmas time, the peasant throng \n
Assembled gay, with dance and Song: \n
The Farmer's Kitchen long had been \n
Of annual sports the busy scene; \n
The wood-fire blaz'd, the chimney wide \n
Presented seats, on either side; \n
Long rows of wooden Trenchers, clean, \n
Bedeck'd with holly-boughs, were seen; \n
The shining Tankard's foamy ale \n
Gave spirits to the Goblin tale, \n
And many a rosy cheek--grew pale. \n
It happen'd, that some sport to shew \n
The ceiling held a MISTLETOE. \n
A magic bough, and well design'd \n
To prove the coyest Maiden, kind. \n
A magic bough, which DRUIDS old \n
Its sacred mysteries enroll'd; \n
And which, or gossip Fame's a liar, \n
Still warms the soul with vivid fire; \n
Still promises a store of bliss \n
While bigots snatch their Idol's kiss. \n
This MISTLETOE was doom'd to be \n
The talisman of Destiny; \n
Beneath its ample boughs we're told \n
Full many a timid Swain grew bold; \n
Full many a roguish eye askance \n
Beheld it with impatient glance, \n
And many a ruddy cheek confest, \n
The triumphs of the beating breast; \n
And many a rustic rover sigh'd \n
Who ask'd the kiss, and was denied. \n
First MARG'RY smil'd and gave her Lover \n
A Kiss; then thank'd her stars, 'twas over! \n
Next, KATE, with a reluctant pace, \n
Was tempted to the mystic place; \n
Then SUE, a merry laughing jade \n
A dimpled yielding blush betray'd; \n
While JOAN her chastity to shew \n
Wish'd "the bold knaves would serve her so," \n
She'd "teach the rogues such wanton play!" \n
And well she could, she knew the way. \n
The FARMER, mute with jealous care, \n
Sat sullen, in his wicker chair; \n
Hating the noisy gamesome host \n
Yet, fearful to resign his post; \n
He envied all their sportive strife \n
But most he watch'd his blooming wife, \n
And trembled, lest her steps should go, \n
Incautious, near the MISTLETOE. \n
Now HODGE, a youth of rustic grace \n
With form athletic; manly face; \n
On MISTRESS HOMESPUN turn'd his eye \n
And breath'd a soul-declaring sigh! \n
Old HOMESPUN, mark'd his list'ning Fair \n
And nestled in his wicker chair; \n
HODGE swore, she might his heart command-- \n
The pipe was dropp'd from HOMESPUN'S hand! \n
HODGE prest her slender waist around; \n
The FARMER check'd his draught, and frown'd! \n
And now beneath the MISTLETOE \n
'Twas MISTRESS HOMESPUN'S turn to go; \n
Old Surly shook his wicker chair, \n
And sternly utter'd--"Let her dare!" \n
HODGE, to the FARMER'S wife declar'd \n
Such husbands never should be spar'd; \n
Swore, they deserv'd the worst disgrace, \n
That lights upon the wedded race; \n
And vow'd--that night he would not go \n
Unblest, beneath the MISTLETOE. \n
The merry group all recommend \n
An harmless Kiss, the strife to end: \n
"Why not ?" says MARG'RY, "who would fear, \n
"A dang'rous moment, once a year?" \n
SUSAN observ'd, that "ancient folks \n
"Were seldom pleas'd with youthful jokes;" \n
But KATE, who, till that fatal hour, \n
Had held, o'er HODGE, unrivall'd pow'r, \n
With curving lip and head aside \n
Look'd down and smil'd in conscious pride, \n
Then, anxious to conceal her care, \n
She humm'd--"what fools some women are!" \n
Now, MISTRESS HOMESPUN, sorely vex'd, \n
By pride and jealous rage perplex'd, \n
And angry, that her peevish spouse \n
Should doubt her matrimonial vows, \n
But, most of all, resolved to make \n
An envious rival's bosom ache; \n
Commanded Hodge to let her go, \n
Nor lead her to the Mistletoe; \n
"Why should you ask it o'er and o'er?" \n
Cried she, "we've been there twice before!" \n
'Tis thus, to check a rival's sway, \n
That Women oft themselves betray; \n
While VANITY, alone, pursuing, \n
They rashly prove, their own undoing. \n<|endoftext|>

From our happy home \n
Through the world we roam \n
One week in all the year, \n
Making winter spring \n
With the joy we bring \n
For Christmas-tide is here. \n
Now the eastern star \n
Shines from afar \n
To light the poorest home; \n
Hearts warmer grow, \n
Gifts freely flow, \n
For Christmas-tide has come. \n
Now gay trees rise \n
Before young eyes, \n
Abloom with tempting cheer; \n
Blithe voices sing, \n
And blithe bells ring, \n
For Christmas-tide is here. \n
Oh, happy chime, \n
Oh, blessed time, \n

A time for being with family \n
A time that's gone so fleetingly \n
Yet lives for always deep in me. \n
A Christmas tree! A Christmas tree! \n
When twelfth night comes whole hauntingly \n
One lingered look and then i see \n
No Christmas tree where it would be. \n

No corner in my house to see \n

’T IS Christmas, and the North wind blows; ’t was two years yesterday \n
Since from the Lusitania’s bows I looked o’er Table Bay, \n
A tripper round the narrow world, a pilgrim of the main, \n
Expecting when her sails unfurled to start for home again. \n
’T is Christmas, and the North wind blows; to-day our hearts are one, \n
Though you are ’mid the English snows and I in Austral sun; \n
You, when you hear the Northern blast, pile high a mightier fire, \n
Our ladies cower until it ’s past in lawn and lace attire. \n
I fancy I can picture you upon this Christmas night, \n
Just sitting as you used to do, the laughter at its height: \n
And then a sudden, silent pause intruding on your glee, \n
And kind eyes glistening because you chanced to think of me. \n
This morning when I woke and knew ’t was Christmas come again, \n
I almost fancied I could view white rime upon the pane, \n
And hear the ringing of the wheels upon the frosty ground, \n
And see the drip that downward steals in icy casket bound. \n
I daresay you ’ll be on the lake, or sliding on the snow, \n
And breathing on your hands to make the circulation flow, \n
Nestling your nose among the furs of which your boa ’s made,— \n
The Fahrenheit here registers a hundred in the shade. \n
It is not quite a Christmas here with this unclouded sky, \n
This pure transparent atmosphere, this sun midheaven-high; \n
To see the rose upon the bush, young leaves upon the trees, \n
And hear the forest’s summer hush or the low hum of bees. \n
But cold winds bring not Christmastide, nor budding roses June, \n
And when it ’s night upon your side we ’re basking in the noon. \n
Kind hearts make Christmas—June can bring blue sky or clouds above; \n
The only universal spring is that which comes of love. \n
And so it ’s Christmas in the South as on the North-Sea coasts, \n
Though we are starved with summer-drouth and you with winter frosts. \n
And we shall have our roast beef here, and think of you the while, \n
Though all the watery hemisphere cuts off the mother isle. \n
Feel sure that we shall think of you, we who have wandered forth, \n
And many a million thoughts will go to-day from south to north; \n
Old heads will muse on churches old, where bells will ring to-day— \n
The very bells, perchance, which tolled their fathers to the clay. \n
And now, good-night! and I shall dream that I am with you all, \n
Watching the ruddy embers gleam athwart the panelled hall; \n
Nor care I if I dream or not, though severed by the foam, \n
My heart is always in the spot which was my childhood’s home. \n<|endoftext|>
christmas \n
Our Christmas tree, stood straight and tall, \n
We had it standing in the hall, \n
With decorations, sparkling bright, \n
And baubles, glittering in the light, \n
Rich tinsel laced around branches wide, \n
With bells and bows, that could be spied \n
Hiding among the dark green pine, \n
In silver and gold, boldly they did shine, \n
And at the very top, such a wondrous sight, \n
A star was placed there, which gave delight. \n
The whole effect so pleasured the eye. \n
We planted it outside, now it's 18 feet high. \n
This year it will once again, be a thrill, \n
Hung with big coloured lights, in the crisp winter chill. \n

"I heard the bells on Christmas Day \n
Their old familiar carols play, \n
And wild and sweet \n
The words repeat \n
Of peace on earth, good-will to men! \n
And thought how, as the day had come, \n
The belfries of all Christendom \n
Had rolled along \n
The unbroken song \n
Of peace on earth, good-will to men! \n
Till, ringing, singing on its way, \n
The world revolved from night to day, \n
A voice, a chime \n
A chant sublime \n
Of peace on earth, good-will to men! \n
Then from each black accursed mouth \n
The cannon thundered in the South, \n
And with the sound \n
The carols drowned \n
Of peace on earth, good-will to men! \n
It was as if an earthquake rent \n
The hearth-stones of a continent, \n
And made forlorn \n
The households born \n
Of peace on earth, good-will to men! \n
And in despair I bowed my head; \n
"There is no peace on earth," I said; \n
"For hate is strong, \n
And mocks the song \n
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!" \n
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep: \n
"God is not dead; nor doth he sleep! \n
The Wrong shall fail, \n
The Right prevail, \n
With peace on earth, good-will to men!" \n<|endoftext|>
christmas \n
Christmas is a-comin’ – but \n
this goose is gettin’ thin… \n
why do I feel I’m in the dock \n
of some unauthorised court of moral judgment \n
with the prospect of spending New Year \n
in some condemned cell of \n
personal opinion remarkably similar to \n
a Dickensian prison now electrified in just one wing…? \n
Forget the whole giving-presents thing – that’s \n
relatively simple – it’s those bloody \n
Christmas cards. Sent yours yet? \n
I’m with the angels on this one – \n
peace on earth and goodwill to all, uh, \n
persons… I’m fully paid up on \n
this one – so – can we stick with that? \n
or do we have to prove it with \n
a ready-printed message once a year? \n
It’s Christmas, dammit – maybe my year-round goodwill \n
is equalled by the whole other lot of you out there? \n
in which case, can we just take that as read, \n
a universal love-in on a level playing field? \n
It’s the subtext – ‘I’ve forgotten your personal existence \n
all the year, but look – Goody Two-Shoes is sending this \n
to show you up – and I’m posting it \n
so late that short of posting in the press \n
one of those announcements that say \n
‘This year Mr and Mrs Smith are sending \n
a donation to charity in place of the many Christmas cards \n
they would have sent to their many friends…’ – or \n
a postcard, \n
‘Now we’re back from our Antarctic trip, \n
Happy New Year! ’ you’re too late to reply…’ \n
which means? \n
Or there's the subtext \n
'We're sending you a very \n
religious card with just the faintest hint that \n
although you may not have noticed it \n
when we had that blazing row \n
across the fence which has \n
simmered on all year, nevertheless \n
we're really more - well, everything - \n
than you bastards - however \n
this puts us, spiritually, \n
one up...' \n
‘Darling, Christmas cards – who sent us one \n
last year? ’ – say no more… \n
Would \n
‘No, we hadn’t quite forgotten you \n
in case you thought we had, and \n
I bet it’s mutual? ’ cards, tastefully \n
designed, be more fun? or \n
'Why should we even know your \n
name and address if we \n
hadn't once thought you worth loving and \n
if so, why should that change? ' \n
I reckon one acid test for those you love \n
is, only think of sending cards to \n
those you’d think of phoning on \n
Christmas Eve or Christmas Day – and then, \n
do just that – no need to send a card as well? \n
Oh well, any excuse to say, I love you.. especially \n
if we mean it... \n
so, anyone who reads this (apart from those \n
who only read to check whether they’d \n
sent us one too) – \n
If an individual can claim to share \n
that universal love which, do we need reminding, \n
should live our lives for us all the year round, \n
please feel my universal love \n
blazing, blazing, towards you… \n
…‘what’s that, darling? Oh yes, I suppose \n
we’d better send them one, in case \n
they think we’d forgotten them… which evidently \n
we had, hadn’t we…? ’ \n
Have a happy holiday and \n
a loving New Year full of peace \n
No really I mean it \n<|endoftext|>

You were never told, Mother, how old Illyawas drunk \n
That last holiday, for five days and nights \n
He stumbled through Petersburg forming \n
A choir of mutes, he dressed them in pink ascension gowns \n
And, then, sold Father's Tirietz stallion so to rent \n
A hall for his Christmas recital: the audience \n
Was rowdy but Illya in his black robes turned on them \n
And gave them that look of his; the hall fell silent \n
And violently he threw his hair to the side and up \n
Went the baton, the recital ended exactly one hour \n
Later when Illya suddenly turned and bowed \n
And his mutes bowed, and what applause and hollering \n
Followed. \n
All of his cronies were there! \n
Illya told us later that he thought the voices \n
Of mutes combine in a sound \n
Like wind passing through big, winter pines. \n
Mother, if for no other reason I regret the war \n
With Japan for, you must now be told, \n
It took the servant, Illya, from us. It was confirmed. \n
He would sit on the rocks by the water and with his stiletto \n
Open clams and pop the raw meats into his mouth \n
And drool and laugh at us children. \n
We hear guns often, now, down near the village. \n
Don't think me a coward, Mother, but it is comfortable \n
Now that I am no longer Czar. I can take pleasure \n
From just a cup of clear water. I hear Illya's choir often. \n
I teach the children about decreasing fractions, that is \n
A lesson best taught by the father. \n
Alexandra conducts the French and singing lessons. \n
Mother, we are again a physical couple. \n
I brush out her hair for her at night. \n
She thinks that we'll be rowing outside Geneva \n
By the spring. I hope she won't be disappointed. \n
Yesterday morning while bread was frying \n
In one corner, she in another washed all of her legs \n
Right in front of the children. I think \n
We became sad at her beauty. She has a purple bruise \n
On an ankle. \n
Like Illya I made her chew on mint. \n
Our Christmas will be in this excellent barn. \n
The guards flirt with your granddaughters and I see... \n
I see nothing wrong with it. Your little one, who is \n
Now a woman, made one soldier pose for her, she did \n
Him in charcoal, but as a bold nude. He was \n
Such an obvious virgin about it; he was wonderful! \n
Today, that same young man found us an enormous azure \n
And pearl samovar. Once, he called me Great Father \n
And got confused. \n
He refused to let me touch him. \n
I know they keep your letters from us. But, Mother, \n
The day they finally put them in my hands \n
I'll know that possessing them I am condemned \n
And possibly even my wife, and my children. \n
We will drink mint tea this evening. \n
Will each of us be increased by death? \n
With fractions as the bottom integer gets bigger, Mother, it \n
Represents less. That's the feeling I have about \n
This letter. I am at your request, The Czar. \n
And I am Nicholas. \n<|endoftext|>
christmas \n
It is the longest night in all the year, \n
Near on the day when the Lord Christ was born; \n
Six hours ago I came and sat down here, \n
And ponder'd sadly, wearied and forlorn. \n
The winter wind that pass'd the chapel door, \n
Sang out a moody tune, that went right well \n
With mine own thoughts: I look'd down on the floor, \n
Between my feet, until I heard a bell \n
Sound a long way off through the forest deep, \n
And toll on steadily; a drowsiness \n
Came on me, so that I fell half asleep, \n
As I sat there not moving: less and less \n
I saw the melted snow that hung in beads \n
Upon my steel-shoes; less and less I saw \n
Between the tiles the bunches of small weeds: \n
Heartless and stupid, with no touch of awe \n
Upon me, half-shut eyes upon the ground, \n
I thought: O Galahad! the days go by, \n
Stop and cast up now that which you have found, \n
So sorely you have wrought and painfully. \n
Night after night your horse treads down alone \n
The sere damp fern, night after night you sit \n
Holding the bridle like a man of stone, \n
Dismal, unfriended: what thing comes of it? \n
And what if Palomydes also ride, \n
And over many a mountain and bare heath \n
Follow the questing beast with none beside? \n
Is he not able still to hold his breath \n
With thoughts of Iseult? doth he not grow pale \n
With weary striving, to seem best of all \n
To her, "as she is best," he saith? to fail \n
Is nothing to him, he can never fall. \n
For unto such a man love-sorrow is \n
So dear a thing unto his constant heart, \n
That even if he never win one kiss, \n
Or touch from Iseult, it will never part. \n
And he will never know her to be worse \n
Than in his happiest dreams he thinks she is: \n
Good knight, and faithful, you have 'scaped the curse \n
In wonderful-wise; you have great store of bliss. \n
Yea, what if Father Launcelot ride out, \n
Can he not think of Guenevere's arms, round \n
Warm and lithe, about his neck, and shout \n
Till all the place grows joyful with the sound? \n
And when he lists can often see her face, \n
And think, "Next month I kiss you, or next week, \n
And still you think of me": therefore the place \n
Grows very pleasant, whatsoever he seek. \n
But me, who ride alone, some carle shall find \n
Dead in my arms in the half-melted snow, \n
When all unkindly with the shifting wind, \n
The thaw comes on at Candlemas: I know \n
Indeed that they will say: "This Galahad \n
If he had lived had been a right good knight; \n
Ah! poor chaste body!" but they will be glad, \n
Not most alone, but all, when in their sight \n
That very evening in their scarlet sleeves \n
The gay-dress'd minstrels sing; no maid will talk \n
Of sitting on my tomb, until the leaves, \n
Grown big upon the bushes of the walk, \n
East of the Palace-pleasaunce, make it hard \n
To see the minster therefrom: well-a-day! \n
Before the trees by autumn were well bared, \n
I saw a damozel with gentle play, \n
Within that very walk say last farewell \n
To her dear knight, just riding out to find \n
(Why should I choke to say it?) the Sangreal, \n
And their last kisses sunk into my mind, \n
Yea, for she stood lean'd forward on his breast, \n
Rather, scarce stood; the back of one dear hand, \n
That it might well be kiss'd, she held and press'd \n
Against his lips; long time they stood there, fann'd \n
By gentle gusts of quiet frosty wind, \n
Till Mador de la porte a-going by, \n
And my own horsehoofs roused them; they untwined, \n
And parted like a dream. In this way I, \n
With sleepy face bent to the chapel floor, \n
Kept musing half asleep, till suddenly \n
A sharp bell rang from close beside the door, \n
And I leapt up when something pass'd me by, \n
Shrill ringing going with it, still half blind \n
I stagger'd after, a great sense of awe \n
At every step kept gathering on my mind, \n
Thereat I have no marvel, for I saw \n
One sitting on the altar as a throne, \n
Whose face no man could say he did not know, \n
And though the bell still rang, he sat alone, \n
With raiment half blood-red, half white as snow. \n
Right so I fell upon the floor and knelt, \n
Not as one kneels in church when mass is said, \n
But in a heap, quite nerveless, for I felt \n
The first time what a thing was perfect dread. \n
But mightily the gentle voice came down: \n
"Rise up, and look and listen, Galahad, \n
Good knight of God, for you will see no frown \n
Upon my face; I come to make you glad. \n
"For that you say that you are all alone, \n
I will be with you always, and fear not \n
You are uncared for, though no maiden moan \n
Above your empty tomb; for Launcelot, \n
"He in good time shall be my servant too, \n
Meantime, take note whose sword first made him knight, \n
And who has loved him alway, yea, and who \n
Still trusts him alway, though in all men's sight, \n
"He is just what you know, O Galahad, \n
This love is happy even as you say, \n
But would you for a little time be glad, \n
To make ME sorry long, day after day? \n
"Her warm arms round his neck half throttle ME, \n
The hot love-tears burn deep like spots of lead, \n
Yea, and the years pass quick: right dismally \n
Will Launcelot at one time hang his head; \n
"Yea, old and shrivell'd he shall win my love. \n
Poor Palomydes fretting out his soul! \n
Not always is he able, son, to move \n
His love, and do it honour: needs must roll \n
"The proudest destrier sometimes in the dust, \n
And then 'tis weary work; he strives beside \n
Seem better than he is, so that his trust \n
Is always on what chances may betide; \n
"And so he wears away, my servant, too, \n
When all these things are gone, and wretchedly \n
He sits and longs to moan for Iseult, who \n
Is no care now to Palomydes: see, \n
"O good son, Galahad, upon this day, \n
Now even, all these things are on your side, \n
But these you fight not for; look up, I say, \n
And see how I can love you, for no pride \n
"Closes your eyes, no vain lust keeps them down. \n
See now you have ME always; following \n
That holy vision, Galahad, go on, \n
Until at last you come to ME to sing \n
"In Heaven always, and to walk around \n
The garden where I am." He ceased, my face \n
And wretched body fell upon the ground; \n
And when I look'd again, the holy place \n
Was empty; but right so the bell again \n
Came to the chapel-door, there entered \n
Two angels first, in white, without a stain, \n
And scarlet wings, then, after them, a bed \n
Four ladies bore, and set it down beneath \n
The very altar-step, and while for fear \n
I scarcely dared to move or draw my breath, \n
Those holy ladies gently came a-near, \n
And quite unarm'd me, saying: "Galahad, \n
Rest here awhile and sleep, and take no thought \n
Of any other thing than being glad; \n
Hither the Sangreal will be shortly brought, \n
"Yet must you sleep the while it stayeth here." \n
Right so they went away, and I, being weary, \n
Slept long and dream'd of Heaven: the bell comes near, \n
I doubt it grows to morning. Miserere! \n
[Enter Two Angels in white, with scarlet wings; also, Four Ladies in gowns of red and green; also an Angel, bearing in his hands a surcoat of white, with a red cross.] \n
AN ANGEL \n
O servant of the high God, Galahad! \n
Rise and be arm'd: the Sangreal is gone forth \n
Through the great forest, and you must be had \n
Unto the sea that lieth on the north: \n
There shall you find the wondrous ship wherein \n
The spindles of King Solomon are laid, \n
And the sword that no man draweth without sin, \n
But if he be most pure: and there is stay'd, \n
Hard by, Sir Launcelot, whom you will meet \n
In some short space upon that ship: first, though, \n
Will come here presently that lady sweet, \n
Sister of Percival, whom you well know, \n
And with her Bors and Percival: stand now, \n
These ladies will to arm you. \n
[FIRST LADY, putting on the hauberk] \n
Galahad, \n
That I may stand so close beneath your brow, \n
Margaret of Antioch, am glad. \n
[SECOND LADY, girding him with the sword.] \n
That I may stand and touch you with my hand, \n
O Galahad, I, Cecily, am glad. \n
[THIRD LADY, buckling on the spurs.] \n
That I may kneel while up above you stand, \n
And gaze at me, O holy Galahad, \n
I, Lucy, am most glad. \n
[FOURTH LADY, putting on the basnet.] \n
O gentle knight, \n
That you bow down to us in reverence, \n
We are most glad, I, Katherine, with delight \n
Must needs fall trembling. \n
[ANGEL, putting on the crossed surcoat.] \n
Galahad, we go hence, \n
For here, amid the straying of the snow, \n
Come Percival's sister, Bors, and Percival. \n
[The Four Ladies carry out the bed, and all go but Galahad.] \n
GALAHAD. \n
How still and quiet everything seems now: \n
They come, too, for I hear the horsehoofs fall. \n
[Enter Sir Bors, Sir Percival and his Sister.] \n
Fair friends and gentle lady, God you save! \n
A many marvels have been here to-night; \n
Tell me what news of Launcelot you have, \n
And has God's body ever been in sight? \n
SIR BORS. \n
Why, as for seeing that same holy thing, \n
As we were riding slowly side by side, \n
An hour ago, we heard a sweet voice sing, \n
And through the bare twigs saw a great light glide, \n
With many-colour'd raiment, but far off; \n
And so pass'd quickly: from the court nought good; \n
Poor merry Dinadan, that with jape and scoff \n
Kept us all merry, in a little wood \n
Was found all hack'd and dead: Sir Lionel \n
And Gauwaine have come back from the great quest, \n
Just merely shamed; and Lauvaine, who loved well \n
Your father Launcelot, at the king's behest \n
Went out to seek him, but was almost slain, \n
Perhaps is dead now; everywhere \n
The knights come foil'd from the great quest, in vain; \n
In vain they struggle for the vision fair. \n<|endoftext|>

I heard the bells on Christmas day \n
Their old familiar carols play, \n
And wild and sweet the words repeat \n
Of peace on earth, good will to men. \n
I thought how, as the day had come, \n
The belfries of all Christendom \n
Had rolled along th'unbroken song \n
Of peace on earth, good will to men. \n
And in despair I bowed my head: \n
'There is no peace on earth, ' I said \n
'For hate is strong, and mocks the song \n
Of peace on earth, good will to men.' \n
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep: \n
'God is not dead, nor doth He sleep; \n
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail, \n
With peace on earth, good will to men.' \n
Till, ringing, singing on its way, \n
The world revolved from night to day \n
A voice, a chime, a chant sublime, \n
Of peace on earth, good will to men. \n<|endoftext|>

Their coats were brown and old; \n
They brought Him little new-born lambs-- \n
They had not any gold. \n
The wise men came from out the east, \n

Wrapt in impenetrable Shade \n

Impell'd by his eternal Love \n
He left his Palaces above \n

When God appeared in mortal clay, \n
The mark of worldly scorn; \n
When the Archangel's heavenly Lays, \n
Attempted the Redeemer's Praise \n

A Humble Form the Godhead wore, \n
The Pains of Poverty he bore, \n
To gaudy Pomp unknown; \n
Tho' in a human walk he trod \n
Still was the Man Almighty God \n
In Glory all his own. \n
Despis'd, oppress'd, the Godhead bears \n
The Torments of this Vale of tears; \n
Nor bade his Vengeance rise; \n
He saw the Creatures he had made, \n
Revile his Power, his Peace invade; \n
He saw with Mercy's Eyes. \n
How shall we celebrate his Name, \n
Who groan'd beneath a Life of shame \n
In all Afflictions tried! \n
The Soul is raptured to concieve \n
A Truth, which Being must believe, \n
The God Eternal died. \n
My Soul exert thy Powers, adore, \n

Mr. Smiggs was a gentleman, \n
And he lived in London town; \n
His wife she was a good kind soul, \n
And seldom known to frown. \n
'Twas on Christmas eve, \n
And Smiggs and his wife lay cosy in bed, \n
When the thought of buying a goose \n
Came into his head. \n
So the next morning, \n
Just as the sun rose, \n
He jump'd out of bed, \n
And he donn'd his clothes, \n
Saying, "Peggy, my dear. \n
You need not frown, \n
For I'll buy you the best goose \n
In all London town." \n
So away to the poultry shop he goes, \n
And bought the goose, as he did propose, \n
And for it he paid one crown, \n
The finest, he thought, in London town. \n
When Smiggs bought the goose \n
He suspected no harm, \n
But a naughty boy stole it \n
From under his arm. \n
Then Smiggs he cried, "Stop, thief! \n
Come back with my goose!" \n
But the naughty boy laugh'd at him, \n
And gave him much abuse. \n
But a policeman captur'd the naughty boy, \n
And gave the goose to Smiggs, \n
And said he was greatly bother'd \n
By a set of juvenile prigs. \n
So the naughty boy was put in prison \n
For stealing the goose., \n
And got ten days' confinement \n
Before he got loose. \n
So Smiggs ran home to his dear Peggy, \n
Saying, "Hurry, and get this fat goose ready, \n
That I have bought for one crown; \n
So, my darling, you need not frown." \n
"Dear Mr Smiggs, I will not frown: \n
I'm sure 'tis cheap for one crown, \n
Especially at Christmas time -- \n
Oh! Mr Smiggs, it's really fine." \n
"Peggy. it is Christmas time, \n
So let us drive dull care away, \n
For we have got a Christmas goose, \n
So cook it well, I pray. \n
"No matter how the poor are clothed, \n
Or if they starve at home, \n
We'll drink our wine, and eat our goose, \n
Aye, and pick it to the bone." \n<|endoftext|>

To be a mother-father, brother-sister, \n

A social activity related to the service of others \n
Is rewarded by a sense of elation and stimulation. \n
In an environment where wider consciousness \n

Sense of oneness is diminished. \n

Con sternation was caused when a name change was brought about in Feb.2002 and the well known and well worn sound of FINISTERRE was transformed into FITZROY. It was as if one had attacked a living person...a great British institution and there was uproar and pandemonium. \n
But FITZROY won the day and the man who carried Darwin on the BEAGLE and invented the weather forecast was the new sound in town. He was a Christian creationist and never forgave himself for evolving Darwin and indeed committed suicide later on in life over the grief of this.) \n

I've been feeling slightly odd lately \n
And I wish that I could say \n
That I'll be over it quite quickly \n
But I think I've lost my way... \n
My bearings are all boggled \n
And I've gotten all mixed up \n
Am I really upside down... \n
Or is it actually downside up? ? \n
I have no wish to offend thee \n
But surely you can see \n
If you give me back my maple leaf \n
I'll be as happy as can be! ! \n

The thief of my Identity \n
To my Friends and Family \n
My true Identity \n
Is all that makes me \n
I stole my identity \n
My personality \n
What I live for, What I breath for \n
What I'd fight for, what I'd die for \n
If not for my soul, \n
I would be lost once again \n
For my True Identity has fled me \n
Fled me for another \n
It is the dancing shadow you play with, \n
The beauty you can see in yourself, \n
And the hostility. \n
It wants to see you suffer, \n
It is most content, when you are in despair. \n
When I can look into my self \n
and find the real Identity of my inner self, \n
Until then I will not blame anyone \n
for my misfortune \n<|endoftext|>

Personal identity \n
Women always need attention \n
If all want its retention \n
In life and elsewhere \n
One must always stand firmly and dare \n
No doubt, they have suffered most \n
At heavy cost \n
Cruelty in behavior \n
And almost compromise with honor \n
She has stood ground well \n
For the whole of world to tell \n
'Look we are no mean creature' \n
But you’re sure future \n
Generations have been bought \n
But we are always caught \n
Between good and devil \n
We shall survive still \n
We shall rise from dust \n
As our main asset is trust \n
We hold it most \n
As time is still not lost \n
Give them strength \n
As they serve till death \n

Forgive me, I thought somebody cared, \n
I thought it was you \n
Or I would surely never dared \n
Reveal myself through \n
Who made you guardian of my days, \n
Master of each step? \n
The spirit will retaliates, \n
Becoming suppressed. \n
I thought it was you, \n
Wearing an angelical smile \n
And with sparkling eyes \n
Bewitching me with its magic. \n
As time slowly passed. \n
The truth was clearly revealed \n
When I saw the fake lover \n
Hiding behind the mask. \n
I thought it was you, \n
The one permanently fixed \n
In my heart and mind \n
And also in my dreams. \n
Disappointed now I am \n
But with faith and hope \n
I will eventually survive \n
And see a brighter light. \n
One sunny day \n
While the butterflies dance \n
And the birds happily sing, \n
I shall find you my angel, \n
The woman of my dream \n

summer \n
Fair summer droops, droop men and beasts therefore, \n
So fair a summer look for nevermore: \n
All good things vanish less than in a day, \n
Peace, plenty, pleasure, suddenly decay. \n
Go not yet away, bright soul of the sad year, \n
The earth is hell when thou leav'st to appear. \n
What, shall those flowers that decked thy garland erst, \n
Upon thy grave be wastefully dispersed? \n
O trees, consume your sap in sorrow's source, \n
Streams, turn to tears your tributary course. \n
Go not yet hence, bright soul of the sad year, \n

How loudly in the sun's clear rays \n
The sweet birds carol forth their lays! \n
But, ah! above, \n
Where saw I my love, \n
Within her room, \n
Small, mantled in gloom, \n
Enclosed around, \n
Where sunlight was drown'd, \n
How little there was earth to me, \n

So near you are, summer stars, \n
So near, strumming, strumming, \n

summer \n
In spring and summer winds may blow, \n
And rains fall after, hard and fast; \n
The tender leaves, if beaten low, \n
Shine but the more for shower and blast \n
But when their fated hour arrives, \n
When reapers long have left the field, \n
When maidens rifle turn'd-up hives, \n
And their last juice fresh apples yield, \n
A leaf perhaps may still remain \n
Upon some solitary tree, \n
Spite of the wind and of the rain . . . \n
A thing you heed not if you see. \n
At last it falls. Who cares? Not one: \n
And yet no power on earth can ever \n
Replace the fallen leaf upon \n
Its spray, so easy to dissever. \n
If such be love, I dare not say. \n
Friendship is such, too well I know: \n
I have enjoyed my summer day; \n
'Tis past; my leaf now lies below. \n<|endoftext|>
summer \n
The last rose of summer lingers of a soft fragrance \n
as the days of summer fade into days only remembered \n
over the fires embers that stir yesterdays moment. \n
The last rose of summer whose beauty brought love and caring \n
in the cool evening breeze to a heart \n
touched briefly by its petals of soft color. \n
The last rose of summer that but briefly spoke of tenderness \n
to a heart in the stillness of the night \n
to be remembered in the quiet fragrance of a rose. \n
The last rose of summer whose petals are pressed to a book \n
hiding it's treasure of yesterdays love \n
remembering days held in time not to be forgotten. \n<|endoftext|>
summer \n
A seated statue of himself he seems. \n
A bronze slowness becomes him. Patently \n
The page he contemplates he doesn't see. \n
The lesson, the long lesson, has been summer. \n
His mind holds summer, as his skin holds sun. \n
For once the homework, all of it, was done. \n
What were the crops, where were the fiery fields \n
Where for so many days so many hours \n
The sun assaulted him with glittering showers. \n
Expect a certain absence in his presence. \n
Expect all winter long a summer scholar, \n
For scarcely all its snows can cool that color. \n<|endoftext|>
summer \n
On the idle hill of summer, \n
Sleepy with the flow of streams, \n
Far I hear the steady drummer \n
Drumming like a noise in dreams. \n
Far and near and low and louder \n
On the roads of earth go by, \n
Dear to friends and food for powder, \n
Soldiers marching, all to die. \n
East and west on fields forgotten \n
Bleach the bones of comrades slain, \n
Lovely lads and dead and rotten; \n
None that go return again. \n
Far the calling bugles hollo, \n
High the screaming fife replies, \n
Gay the files of scarlet follow: \n
Woman bore me, I will rise. \n<|endoftext|>
summer \n
Athwart the star-lit midnight sky \n
Luminous fleecy clouds drift by, \n
As the mysterious, pallid moon \n
Sinks in the waveless still lagoon. \n
Now that the queen of night is dead, \n
The starry commonwealth o'erhead \n
(Softer and fairer than gaudy day) \n
Sheds lustrous light from the Milky Way; \n
While the Dog-star gleams, and the Sisters Seven, \n
Float tremulously in the misty heaven. \n
Faintly, afar the horse-bells ring; \n
Myriads of wakened crickets sing; \n
And the spirit voices of the night \n
Sing snatches of fairy music bright, \n
Old-world melodies - lang syne sung - \n
Recalling days when the heart was young, \n
Whose wonderful cadences fall and rise, \n
As the wind in the casuarina sighs; \n
And the world seems 'gulfed, this summer night, \n
In a flood of delicious, dreamy light. \n<|endoftext|>
summer \n
I looked into my heart to write \n
And found a desert there. \n
But when I looked again I heard \n
Howling and proud in every word \n
The hyena despair. \n
Great summer sun, great summer sun, \n
All loss burns in trophies; \n
And in the cold sheet of the sky \n
Lifelong the fishlipped lovers lie \n
Kissing catastrophes. \n
O loving garden where I lay \n
When under the breasted tree \n
My son stood up behind my eyes \n
And groaned: Remember that the price \n
Is vinegar for me. \n
Great summer sun, great summer sun, \n
Turn back to the designer: \n
I would not be the one to start \n
The breaking day and the breaking heart \n
For all the grief in China. \n
My one, my one, my only love, \n
Hide, hide your face in a leaf, \n
And let the hot tear falling burn \n
The stupid heart that will not learn \n
The everywhere of grief. \n
Great summer sun, great summer sun, \n
Turn back to the never-never \n
Cloud-cuckoo, happy, far-off land \n
Where all the love is true love, and \n
True love goes on for ever. \n<|endoftext|>
summer \n
No matter how hard I listen, the wind speaks \n
One syllable, which has no comfort in it-- \n
Only a rasping of air through the dead elm. \n
Once a poet told me of his friend who was torn apart \n
By two pigs in a field in Poland. The man \n
Was a prisoner of the Nazis, and they watched, \n
He said, with interest and a drunken approval . . . \n
If terror is a state of complete understanding, \n
Then there was probably a point at which the man \n
Went mad, and felt nothing, though certainly \n
He understood everything that was there: after all, \n
He could see blood splash beneath him on the stubble, \n
He could hear singing float toward him from the barracks. \n
And though I don't know much about madness, \n
I know it lives in the thin body like a harp \n
Behind the rib cage. It makes it painful to move. \n
And when you kneel in madness your knees are glass, \n
And so you must stand up again with great care. \n
Maybe this wind was what he heard in 1941. \n
Maybe I have raised a dead man into this air, \n
And now I will have to bury him inside my body, \n
And breathe him in, and do nothing but listen-- \n
Until I hear the black blood rushing over \n
The stone of my skull, and believe it is music. \n
But some things are not possible on the earth. \n
And that is why people make poems about the dead. \n
And the dead watch over then, until they are finished: \n
Until their hands feel like glass on the page, \n
And snow collects in the blind eyes of statues. \n<|endoftext|>

summer \n
THE wind has swept from the wide atmosphere \n
Each vapour that obscured the sunset's ray, \n
And pallid Evening twines its beaming hair \n
In duskier braids around the languid eyes of Day: \n
Silence and Twilight, unbeloved of men, \n
Creep hand in hand from yon obscurest glen. \n
They breathe their spells towards the departing day, \n
Encompassing the earth, air, stars, and sea; \n
Light, sound, and motion, own the potent sway, \n
Responding to the charm with its own mystery. \n
The winds are still, or the dry church-tower grass \n
Knows not their gentle motions as they pass. \n
Thou too, aerial pile, whose pinnacles \n
Point from one shrine like pyramids of fire, \n
Obey'st I in silence their sweet solemn spells, \n
Clothing in hues of heaven thy dim and distant spire, \n
Around whose lessening and invisible height \n
Gather among the stars the clouds of night. \n
The dead are sleeping in their sepulchres: \n
And, mouldering as they sleep, a thrilling sound, \n
Half sense half thought, among the darkness stirs, \n
Breathed from their wormy beds all living things around, \n
And, mingling with the still night and mute sky, \n
Its awful hush is felt inaudibly. \n
Thus solemnized and softened, death is mild \n
And terrorless as this serenest night. \n
Here could I hope, like some enquiring child \n
Sporting on graves, that death did hide from human sight \n
Sweet secrets, or beside its breathless sleep \n
That loveliest dreams perpetual watch did keep. \n<|endoftext|>
summer \n
Pray but one prayer for me 'twixt thy closed lips, \n
Think but one thought of me up in the stars. \n
The summer night waneth, the morning light slips, \n
Faint and grey 'twixt the leaves of the aspen, betwixt the cloud-bars \n
That are patiently waiting there for the dawn: \n
Patient and colourless, though Heaven's gold \n
Waits to float through them along with the sun. \n
Far out in the meadows, above the young corn, \n
The heavy elms wait, and restless and cold \n
The uneasy wind rises; the roses are dun; \n
Through the long twilight they pray for the dawn, \n
Round the lone house in the midst of the corn, \n
Speak but one word to me over the corn, \n
Over the tender, bow'd locks of the corn. \n<|endoftext|>
summer \n
Now swarthy Summer, by rude health embrowned, \n
Precedence takes of rosy fingered Spring; \n
And laughing Joy, with wild flowers prank'd, and crown'd, \n
A wild and giddy thing, \n
And Health robust, from every care unbound, \n
Come on the zephyr's wing, \n
And cheer the toiling clown. \n
Happy as holiday-enjoying face, \n
Loud tongued, and "merry as a marriage bell," \n
Thy lightsome step sheds joy in every place; \n
And where the troubled dwell, \n
Thy witching charms wean them of half their cares; \n
And from thy sunny spell, \n
They greet joy unawares. \n
Then with thy sultry locks all loose and rude, \n
And mantle laced with gems of garish light, \n
Come as of wont; for I would fain intrude, \n
And in the world's despite, \n
Share the rude wealth that thy own heart beguiles; \n
If haply so I might \n
Win pleasure from thy smiles. \n
Me not the noise of brawling pleasure cheers, \n
In nightly revels or in city streets; \n
But joys which soothe, and not distract the ears, \n
That one at leisure meets \n
In the green woods, and meadows summer-shorn, \n
Or fields, where bee-fly greets \n
The ear with mellow horn. \n
The green-swathed grasshopper, on treble pipe, \n
Sings there, and dances, in mad-hearted pranks; \n
There bees go courting every flower that's ripe, \n
On baulks and sunny banks; \n
And droning dragon-fly, on rude bassoon, \n
Attempts to give God thanks \n
In no discordant tune. \n
The speckled thrush, by self-delight embued, \n
There sings unto himself for joy's amends, \n
And drinks the honey dew of solitude. \n
There Happiness attends \n
With inbred Joy until the heart o'erflow, \n
Of which the world's rude friends, \n
Nought heeding, nothing know. \n
There the gay river, laughing as it goes, \n
Plashes with easy wave its flaggy sides, \n
And to the calm of heart, in calmness shows \n
What pleasure there abides, \n
To trace its sedgy banks, from trouble free: \n
Spots Solitude provides \n
To muse, and happy be. \n
There ruminating 'neath some pleasant bush, \n
On sweet silk grass I stretch me at mine ease, \n
Where I can pillow on the yielding rush; \n
And, acting as I please, \n
Drop into pleasant dreams; or musing lie, \n
Mark the wind-shaken trees, \n
And cloud-betravelled sky. \n
There think me how some barter joy for care, \n
And waste life's summer-health in riot rude, \n
Of nature, nor of nature's sweets aware. \n
When passions vain intrude, \n
These, by calm musings, softened are and still; \n
And the heart's better mood \n
Feels sick of doing ill. \n
There I can live, and at my leisure seek \n
Joys far from cold restraints--not fearing pride-- \n
Free as the winds, that breathe upon my cheek \n
Rude health, so long denied. \n
Here poor Integrity can sit at ease, \n
And list self-satisfied \n
The song of honey-bees. \n
The green lane now I traverse, where it goes \n
Nought guessing, till some sudden turn espies \n
Rude batter'd finger post, that stooping shows \n
Where the snug mystery lies; \n
And then a mossy spire, with ivy crown, \n
Cheers up the short surprise, \n
And shows a peeping town. \n
I see the wild flowers, in their summer morn \n
Of beauty, feeding on joy's luscious hours; \n
The gay convolvulus, wreathing round the thorn, \n
Agape for honey showers; \n
And slender kingcup, burnished with the dew \n
Of morning's early hours, \n
Like gold yminted new. \n
And mark by rustic bridge, o'er shallow stream, \n
Cow-tending boy, to toil unreconciled, \n
Absorbed as in some vagrant summer dream; \n
Who now, in gestures wild, \n
Starts dancing to his shadow on the wall, \n
Feeling self-gratified, \n
Nor fearing human thrall. \n
Or thread the sunny valley laced with streams, \n
Or forests rude, and the o'ershadow'd brims \n
Of simple ponds, where idle shepherd dreams, \n
Stretching his listless limbs; \n
Or trace hay-scented meadows, smooth and long, \n
Where joy's wild impulse swims \n
In one continued song. \n
I love at early morn, from new mown swath, \n
To see the startled frog his route pursue; \n
To mark while, leaping o'er the dripping path, \n
His bright sides scatter dew, \n
The early lark that from its bustle flies, \n
To hail his matin new; \n
And watch him to the skies. \n
To note on hedgerow baulks, in moisture sprent, \n
The jetty snail creep from the mossy thorn, \n
With earnest heed, and tremulous intent, \n
Frail brother of the morn, \n
That from the tiny bent's dew-misted leaves \n
Withdraws his timid horn, \n
And fearful vision weaves. \n
Or swallow heed on smoke-tanned chimney top, \n
Wont to be first unsealing Morning's eye, \n
Ere yet the bee hath gleaned one wayward drop \n
Of honey on his thigh; \n
To see him seek morn's airy couch to sing, \n
Until the golden sky \n
Bepaint his russet wing. \n
Or sauntering boy by tanning corn to spy, \n
With clapping noise to startle birds away, \n
And hear him bawl to every passer by \n
To know the hour of day; \n
While the uncradled breezes, fresh and strong, \n
With waking blossoms play, \n
And breathe Æolian song. \n
I love the south-west wind, or low or loud, \n
And not the less when sudden drops of rain \n
Moisten my glowing cheek from ebon cloud, \n
Threatening soft showers again, \n
That over lands new ploughed and meadow grounds, \n
Summer's sweet breath unchain, \n
And wake harmonious sounds. \n
Rich music breathes in Summer's every sound; \n
And in her harmony of varied greens, \n
Woods, meadows, hedge-rows, corn-fields, all around \n
Much beauty intervenes, \n
Filling with harmony the ear and eye; \n
While o'er the mingling scenes \n
Far spreads the laughing sky. \n
See, how the wind-enamoured aspen leaves \n
Turn up their silver lining to the sun! \n
And hark! the rustling noise, that oft deceives, \n
And makes the sheep-boy run: \n
The sound so mimics fast-approaching showers, \n
He thinks the rain's begun, \n
And hastes to sheltering bowers. \n
But now the evening curdles dank and grey, \n
Changing her watchet hue for sombre weed; \n
And moping owls, to close the lids of day, \n
On drowsy wing proceed; \n
While chickering crickets, tremulous and long, \n
Light's farewell inly heed, \n
And give it parting song. \n
The pranking bat its flighty circlet makes; \n
The glow-worm burnishes its lamp anew; \n
O'er meadows dew-besprent, the beetle wakes \n
Inquiries ever new, \n
Teazing each passing ear with murmurs vain, \n
As wanting to pursue \n
His homeward path again. \n
Hark! 'tis the melody of distant bells \n
That on the wind with pleasing hum rebounds \n
By fitful starts, then musically swells \n
O'er the dim stilly grounds; \n
While on the meadow-bridge the pausing boy \n
Listens the mellow sounds, \n
And hums in vacant joy. \n
Now homeward-bound, the hedger bundles round \n
His evening faggot, and with every stride \n
His leathern doublet leaves a rustling sound, \n
Till silly sheep beside \n
His path start tremulous, and once again \n
Look back dissatisfied, \n
And scour the dewy plain. \n
How sweet the soothing calmness that distills \n
O'er the heart's every sense its opiate dews, \n
In meek-eyed moods and ever balmy trills! \n
That softens and subdues, \n
With gentle Quiet's bland and sober train, \n
Which dreamy eve renews \n
In many a mellow strain! \n
I love to walk the fields, they are to me \n
A legacy no evil can destroy; \n
They, like a spell, set every rapture free \n
That cheer'd me when a boy. \n
Play--pastime--all Time's blotting pen conceal'd, \n
Comes like a new-born joy, \n
To greet me in the field. \n
For Nature's objects ever harmonize \n
With emulous Taste, that vulgar deed annoys; \n
Which loves in pensive moods to sympathize, \n
And meet vibrating joys \n
O'er Nature's pleasing things; nor slighting, deems \n
Pastimes, the Muse employs, \n
Vain and obtrusive themes. \n<|endoftext|>
summer \n
In the wild soft summer darkness \n
How many and many a night we two together \n
Sat in the park and watched the Hudson \n
Wearing her lights like golden spangles \n
Glinting on black satin. \n
The rail along the curving pathway \n
Was low in a happy place to let us cross, \n
And down the hill a tree that dripped with bloom \n
Sheltered us, \n
While your kisses and the flowers, \n
Falling, falling, \n
Tangled in my hair. . . . \n
The frail white stars moved slowly over the sky. \n
And now, far off \n
In the fragrant darkness \n
The tree is tremulous again with bloom \n
For June comes back. \n

Dreamily before her mirror shakes from her hair \n
This year's blossoms, clinging to its coils? \n<|endoftext|>
summer \n
The turquoise pool rose up to meet us, \n
its slide a silver afterthought down which \n
we plunged, screaming, into a mirage of bubbles. \n
We did not exist beyond the gaze of a boy. \n
Shaking water off our limbs, we lifted \n
up from ladder rungs across the fern-cool \n
lip of rim. Afternoon. Oiled and sated, \n
we sunbathed, rose and paraded the concrete, \n
danced to the low beat of "Duke of Earl". \n
Past cherry colas, hot-dogs, Dreamsicles, \n
we came to the counter where bees staggered \n
into root beer cups and drowned. We gobbled \n
cotton candy torches, sweet as furtive kisses, \n
shared on benches beneath summer shadows. \n
Cherry. Elm. Sycamore. We spread our chenille \n
blankets across grass, pressed radios to our ears, \n
mouthing the old words, then loosened \n
thin bikini straps and rubbed baby oil with iodine \n
across sunburned shoulders, tossing a glance \n
through the chain link at an improbable world. \n<|endoftext|>

As summer's heat may simmer as weld. \n
Some summer's heat can burn as long... \n
This summer's heat can impel a song. \n
Summer's heat can cook and bake... \n
Summer's heat of life can take. \n
Boil and broil a heart so hot... \n
A summer's heat can break that romanceful knot. \n
This heat of summer can smoulder and rot. \n
Anger's heat, heats up my libido's furnace... \n
This love of summer can invoke to heart, a loving furnish. \n
Love of summer brings to mind, a resurgance of love... \n
Summer's sun may bathe one and all with heat fro' above. \n
Summer's heat can bring to beaches and swimming pools... \n
Visions of women in bikinied thongs, these things my eyes do love. \n<|endoftext|>
summer \n
I \n
The dawn laughs out on orient hills \n
And dances with the diamond rills; \n
The ambrosial wind but faintly stirs \n
The silken, beaded gossamers; \n
In the wide valleys, lone and fair, \n
Lyrics are piped from limpid air, \n
And, far above, the pine trees free \n
Voice ancient lore of sky and sea. \n
Come, let us fill our hearts straightway \n
With hope and courage of the day. \n
II \n
Noon, hiving sweets of sun and flower, \n
Has fallen on dreams in wayside bower, \n
Where bees hold honeyed fellowship \n
With the ripe blossom of her lip; \n
All silent are her poppied vales \n
And all her long Arcadian dales, \n
Where idleness is gathered up \n
A magic draught in summer's cup. \n
Come, let us give ourselves to dreams \n
By lisping margins of her streams. \n
III \n
Adown the golden sunset way \n
The evening comes in wimple gray; \n
By burnished shore and silver lake \n
Cool winds of ministration wake; \n
O'er occidental meadows far \n
There shines the light of moon and star, \n
And sweet, low-tinkling music rings \n
About the lips of haunted springs. \n
In quietude of earth and air \n
'Tis meet we yield our souls to prayer. \n<|endoftext|>

summer \n
That strain again? It seems to tell \n
Of something like a joy departed; \n
I love its mourning accents well, \n
Like voice of one, ah! broken-hearted. \n
That note that pensive dies away, \n
And can each answering thrill awaken, \n
It sadly, wildly, seems to say, \n
Thy meek heart mourns its truth forsaken. \n
Or there was one who never more \n
Shall meet thee with the looks of gladness, \n
When all of happier life was o'er, \n
When first began thy night of sadness. \n
Sweet mourner, cease that melting strain, \n
Too well it suits the grave's cold slumbers; \n
Too well the heart that loved in vain \n
Breathes, lives, and weeps in those wild numbers. \n<|endoftext|>

Break off! Dance no more! \n
Danger is at the door. \n
Music is in arms. \n
To signal war's alarms. \n
Hark, a sudden trumpet calling \n
Over the hill! \n
Why are you calling, trumpet, calling? \n
What is your will? \n
Men, men, men ! \n
Men who are ready to fight \n
For their country's life, and the right \n
Of a liberty-loving land to be \n
Free, free, free! \n
Free from a tyrant's chain, \n
Free from dishonor's stain, \n
Free to guard and maintain \n
All that her fathers fought for, \n
All that her sons have wrought for, \n
Resolute, brave, and free! \n
Call again, trumpet, call again, \n
Call up the men! \n
Do you hear the storm of cheers \n
Mingled with the women's tears \n
And the tramp, tramp, tramp of marching feet? \n
Do you hear the throbbing drum \n
As the hosts of battle come \n
Keeping time, time, time to its beat? \n
O Music give a song \n
To make their spirit strong \n
For the fury of the tempest they must meet. \n
The hoarse roar \n
Of the monster guns; \n
And the sharp bark \n
Of the lesser guns; \n
The whine of the shells, \n
The rifles' clatter \n
Where the bullets patter, \n
The rattle, rattle, rattle \n
Of the mitrailleuse in battle, \n
And the yells \n
Of the men who charge through hells \n
Where the poison gas descends, \n
And the bursting shrapnel rends \n
Limb from limb \n
In the dim \n
Chaos and clamor of the strife \n
Where no man thinks of his life \n
But only of fighting through, \n
Blindly fighting through, through! \n
'Tis done \n
At last! \n
The victory won, \n
The dissonance of warfare past! \n
O Music mourn the dead \n
Whose loyal blood was shed, \n
And sound the taps for every hero slain; \n
Then lead into the song \n
That made their spirit strong, \n
And tell the world they did not die in vain. \n
Thank God we can see, in the glory of morn, \n
The invincible flag that our fathers defended; \n
And our hearts can repeat what the heroes have sworn, \n
That war shall not end till the war-lust is ended. \n
Then the bloodthirsty sword shall no longer be lord \n
Of the nations oppressed by the conqueror's horde, \n
But the banners of freedom shall peacefully wave \n
O'er the world of the free and the lands of the brave. \n<|endoftext|>

Whether with Freedom, stretched in her own gore, \n
Whose pleading hands and suppliant distress \n
Still offer hearts that thirst for Righteousness \n
A glorious cause to strike or perish for. \n
England, which side is thine? Thou hast had sons \n
Would shrink not from the choice however grim, \n
Were Justice trampled on and Courage downed; \n

AMONGST THE HIGHLY PLACED \n
It is considered low to talk about food. \n
The fact is: they have \n
Already eaten. \n
The lowly must leave this earth \n
Without having tasted \n
Any good meat. \n
For wondering where they come from and \n
Where they are going \n
The fine evenings find them \n
Too exhausted. \n
They have not yet seen \n
The mountains and the great sea \n
When their time is already up. \n
If the lowly do not \n
Think about what's low \n
They will never rise. \n
THE BREAD OF THE HUNGRY HAS \n
ALL BEEN EATEN \n
Meat has become unknown. Useless \n
The pouring out of the people's sweat. \n
The laurel groves have been \n
Lopped down. \n
From the chimneys of the arms factories \n
Rises smoke. \n
THE HOUSE-PAINTER SPEAKS OF \n
GREAT TIMES TO COME \n
The forests still grow. \n
The fields still bear \n
The cities still stand. \n
The people still breathe. \n
ON THE CALENDAR THE DAY IS NOT \n
YET SHOWN \n
Every month, every day \n
Lies open still. One of those days \n
Is going to be marked with a cross. \n
THE WORKERS CRY OUT FOR BREAD \n
The merchants cry out for markets. \n
The unemployed were hungry. The employed \n
Are hungry now. \n
The hands that lay folded are busy again. \n
They are making shells. \n
THOSE WHO TAKE THE MEAT FROM THE TABLE \n
Teach contentment. \n
Those for whom the contribution is destined \n
Demand sacrifice. \n
Those who eat their fill speak to the hungry \n
Of wonderful times to come. \n
Those who lead the country into the abyss \n
Call ruling too difficult \n
For ordinary men. \n
WHEN THE LEADERS SPEAK OF PEACE \n
The common folk know \n
That war is coming. \n
When the leaders curse war \n
The mobilization order is already written out. \n
THOSE AT THE TOP SAY: PEACE \n
AND WAR \n
Are of different substance. \n
But their peace and their war \n
Are like wind and storm. \n
War grows from their peace \n
Like son from his mother \n
He bears \n
Her frightful features. \n
Their war kills \n
Whatever their peace \n
Has left over. \n
ON THE WALL WAS CHALKED: \n
They want war. \n
The man who wrote it \n
Has already fallen. \n
THOSE AT THE TOP SAY: \n
This way to glory. \n
Those down below say: \n
This way to the grave. \n
THE WAR WHICH IS COMING \n
Is not the first one. There were \n
Other wars before it. \n
When the last one came to an end \n
There were conquerors and conquered. \n
Among the conquered the common people \n
Starved. Among the conquerors \n
The common people starved too. \n
THOSE AT THE TOP SAY COMRADESHIP \n
Reigns in the army. \n
The truth of this is seen \n
In the cookhouse. \n
In their hearts should be \n
The selfsame courage. But \n
On their plates \n
Are two kinds of rations. \n
WHEN IT COMES TO MARCHING MANY DO NOT \n
KNOW \n
That their enemy is marching at their head. \n
The voice which gives them their orders \n
Is their enemy's voice and \n
The man who speaks of the enemy \n
Is the enemy himself. \n
IT IS NIGHT \n
The married couples \n
Lie in their beds. The young women \n
Will bear orphans. \n
GENERAL, YOUR TANK IS A POWERFUL VEHICLE \n

But it has one defect: \n
It needs a mechanic. \n

Remembered \n
A nation born from war, for the “purpose” of establishing freedom \n
A nation divided in war, in an “attempt” to fulfill the goal of freedom \n
A nation engaged in world wars, in the task of “preserving” freedom \n
A nation policing the world, in the “pursuit” of freedom \n
So many young lives have been lost, for the “cause” of freedom \n
Let us remember those who paid the “ultimate price, ” for freedom \n
And dear God, please tell us! - “What! ” - is freedom? \n
We need not war \n
We need not war, to show us how freedom is made \n
What we need is love to show us how freedom is played. \n
For freedom is not - but to “do as we please” \n
But rather, to “please others, ” because of what we achieve. \n
No such thing! \n
There is no such passion as hate, - only - a mental state \n
Of ignorance \n
For what we fail to understand, from our source of knowledge \n
We choose the accepted norm of utter indifference \n
Therefore, our feelings of love, we profoundly fear to acknowledge \n
“Freedom” is to serve \n
“To serve requires love; only with love, do we obtain freedom” \n

Reflections on the poet's youth. An apostrophe to Selma. Oscar obtains leave to go to Inis-thona, an island of Scandinavia. The mournful story of Argon and Ruro, the two sons of the king of Inis-thona. Oscar revenges their death, and returns in triumph to Selma. A soliloquy by the poet himself. \n
Our youth is like the dream of the hunter on the hill of heath. He sleeps in the mild beams of the sun: he awakes amidst a storm; the red lightning flies around: trees shake their heads to the wind! He looks back with joy on the day of the sun, and the pleasant dreams of his rest! When shall Ossian's youth return? When his ear delight in the sound of arms? When shall I, like Oscar, travel in the light of my steel? Come with your streams, ye hills of Cona! listen to the voice of Ossian. The song rises, like the sun, in my soul. I feel the joys of other times. \n
I behold thy towers, O Selma! the oaks of thy shaded wall: thy streams sound in my ear; thy heroes gather round. Fingal sits in the midst. He leans on the shield of Trenmor; his spear stands against the wall; he listens to the songs of his bards. The deeds of his arm are heard; the actions of the king in his youth! Oscar had returned from the chase, and heard the hero's praise. He took the shield of Branno from the wall; his eyes were filed with tears. Red was the cheek of youth. His voice was trembling low. My spear shook its bright head in his hand: he spoke to Morven's king. \n
"Fingal! thou king of heroes! Ossian, next to him in war! ye have fought in your youth; your names are renowned in song. Oscar is like the mist of Cona; I appear and I vanish away. The bard will not know my name. The hunter will not search in the heath for my tomb. Let me fight, O heroes, in the battles of Inis-thona. Distant is the land of my war! ye shall not hear of Oscar's fall: some bard may find me there; some bard may give my name to song. The daughter of the stranger shall see my tomb, and weep over the youth, that came from afar. The bard shall say, at the feast, Hear the song of Oscar from the distant land!" \n
" Oscar," replied the king of Morven, " thou shalt fight, son of my fame! Prepare my dark-bosomed ship to carry my hero to Inis-thona. Son of my son, regard our fame; thou art of the race of renown: let not the children of strangers say, Feeble are the sons of Morven! Be thou, in battle, a roaring storm: mild as the evening sun in peace! Tell, Oscar, to Inis-thona's king, that Fingal remembers his youth; when we strove in the combat together, in the days of Agandecca." \n
They lifted up the sounding sail: the wind whistled through the thongs of their masts. Waves lashed the oozy rocks: the strength of ocean roars. My son beheld, from the wave, the land of groves. He rushed into Runa's sounding bay, and sent his sword to Annir of spears. The gray-headed hero rose, when he saw the sword of Fingal. His eyes were full of tears; he remembered his battles in youth. Twice had they lifted the spear before the lovely Agandecca.: heroes stood far distant, as if two spirits were striving in winds. \n
" But now," began the king, " I am old; the Sword lies useless in my hall. Thou who art of Morven's race! Annir has seen the battle of spears; but now he is pale and withered, like the oak of Lano. I have no son to meet thee with joy, to bring thee to the halls of his fathers. Argon is pale in the tomb, and Ruro is no more. My daughter is in the hall of strangers: she longs to behold my tomb. Her spouse shakes ten thousand spears; he comes a cloud of death from Lano. Come, to share the feast of Annir, son of echoing Morven? \n
Three days they feasted together. On the fourth, Annir heard the name of Oscar. They rejoiced in the shell. They pursued the boars of Runa. Beside the fount of mossy stones the weary heroes rest. The tear steals in secret from Annir: he broke the rising sigh. "Here darkly rest," the hero said, "the children of my youth. This stone is the tomb of Ruro; that tree sounds over the grave of Argon. Do ye hear my voice, O my sons, within your narrow house? Or do ye speak in these rustling leaves, when the wind of the desert rises?" \n
"King of Inis-thona," said Oscar, "how fell the children of youth? The wild boar rushes over their tombs, but he does not disturb their repose. They pursue deer formed of clouds, and bend their airy bow. They still love the sport of their youth; and mount the wind with joy." \n
"Cormalo," replied the king, " is a chief of ten thousand spears. He dwells at the waters of Lano which sends forth the vapor of death. He came to Runa's echoing halls, and sought the honor of the spear. The youth was lovely as the first beam of the sun; few were they who could meet him in fight. My heroes yielded to Cormalo; my daughter was seized in his love. Argon and Ruro returned from the chase; the tears of their pride descend: they roll their silent eyes on Runa's heroes, who had yielded to stranger. Three days they feasted with Cormalo; on the fourth young Argon fought. But who could light with Argon? Cormalo is overcome. His heart swelled with the grief of pride; he resolved in secret to behold the death of my sons. They went to the hills of Runa; they pursued the dark-brown hinds. The arrow of Cormalo flew in secret; my children fell in blood. He came to the maid of his love; to Inis-thona's long-haired maid. They fled over the desert, Annir remained alone. Night came on, and day appeared; nor Argon's voice nor Ruro's came. At length their much-loved dog was seen; the fleet and bounding Runa. He came into the hall and howled; and seemed to look towards the place of their fall. We followed him; we found them here: we laid them by this mossy stream. This is the haunt of Annir, when the chase of the hinds is past. I bend like the trunk of an aged oak; my tears for ever flow!" \n
" O Ronnan!" said the rising Oscar, "Osgar, king of spears! call my heroes to my side, the sons of streamy Morven. To-day we go to Lano's water, that sends forth the vapor of death. Cormalo will not long rejoice: death is often at the point of our swords!" \n
They came over the desert like stormy clouds, when the winds roll them along the heath; their edges are tinged with lightning; the echoing groves foresee the storm! The horn of Oscar's battle is heard; Lano shook over all its waves. The children of the lake convened around the sounding shield of Cormalo. Oscar fought as he was wont in war. Cormalo fell beneath his sword: the sons of dismal Lano fled to their secret vales! Oscar brought the daughter of Inis-thona to Annir's echoing halls. The face of age is bright with joy; he blest the king of swords. \n
How great was the joy of Ossian, when he beheld the distant sail of his son! it was like a cloud of light that rises in the east, when the traveller is sad in a land unknown: and dismal night with her ghosts, is sitting around in shades! We brought him with songs to Selma's halls. Fingal spread the feast of shells. A thousand bards raised the name of Oscar: Morven answered to the sound. The daughter of Toscar was there; her voice was like the harp, when the distant sound comes in the evening, on the soft rustling breeze of the vale! \n
O lay me, ye that see the light, near some rock of my hills! let the thick hazels be around, let the rustling oak be near. Green be the place of my rest; let the sound of the distant torrent be heard. Daughter of Toscar, take the harp, and raise the lovely song of Selma; that sleep may overtake my soul in the midst of joy; that the dreams of my youth may return, and the days of the mighty Fingal. Selma! I behold thy towers, thy trees, thy shaded wall! I see the heroes of Morven; I hear the song of bards: Oscar lifts the sword of Cormalo; a thousand youths admire its studded thongs. They look with wonder on my son: they admire the strength of his arm. They mark the joy of his father's eyes; they long for an equal fame, and ye shall have your fame, O sons of streamy Morven! My soul is often brightened with song; I remember the friends of my youth. But sleep descends in the sound of the harp! pleasant dreams begin to rise! Ye Sons of the chase, stand far distant nor disturb my rest The bard of other times holds discourse with his fathers! the chiefs of the days of old! Sons of the chase, stand far distant! disturb not the dreams of Ossian! \n<|endoftext|>

war \n
The Children of War are like little flowers trampled, \n
Young and innocent, fragile and helpless, \n
Surrounded by violence and rampant destruction- \n
Their faces are filled with doubts and fear. \n
The Children of War, so precious and dear, \n
Stripped of their childhood years, their youth stolen away \n
Are little Saints for human failing through no fault of their own. \n
The Children of War, their lives lost and scarred, \n
Are the world's hopes and future wasted; \n
They are the cures never found, inventions never made, \n
Dreams unfulfilled, thoughts and ideas forever gone -- \n
An irrational tragedy, no justification to be found. \n<|endoftext|>
war \n
Within themselves, they hold \n
more than any man or woman should be asked to hold; \n
they are the unsung heroes of the peace \n
which clutches at the coat-tails of a war; \n
and we can never truly know them; \n
only offer them love, support, respect… \n
My first school had been an officers’ recuperation hospital \n
or final hospice for the wounded – in their body or their mind - \n
in the 1914-18 war; now \n
the dignified head doctor of few words \n
and his beautifully-mannered, voluptuous \n
ex-head-nurse wife \n
had made of it an ideal, loving school \n
for the new children of a new era after \n
‘the war to end all wars’… \n
The last resting place of warriors with screaming silent minds \n
who could not recuperate or \n
who found death so much more peaceful than their life \n
became, first the art room, \n
then the chapel: death, art, God and life \n
all together in one room. \n
My second school had as its teaching staff \n
several ex-officers who had chosen to shroud their memories \n
in teaching that new generation; but ironically, \n
were asked to run the cadet force which was \n
intended to preserve that lovely peace.. \n
the sergeant-major who taught us PT and defensive war \n
had a face that was a repulsive souvenir – \n
like camouflage – brown, red, livid white, \n
almost the yellow-green of mustard gas \n
that had painted war upon him; \n
though he saved his lungs… \n
fine, stern, stiff-upper-lip teachers \n
shrouding their memories, until \n
some pupil tested them too far – \n
then their anger spilled, their canes and swagger-sticks \n
fiercely wielded, were memories for those (not us) who knew, \n
of discipline that might shoot at dawn \n
for the sake of lives then saved at dusk… \n
today, they’d be hauled into court for passing on 'abuse'; \n
we were taught by heroes. \n
My third school gave me a housemaster, \n
another unsung, unsinging hero, a confirmed bachelor \n
so we thought, who likewise buried unknown memories \n
in devoted teaching; few clues except \n
the same occasional, devastating temper when aroused; \n
in his modest study, a few small \n
muzzy photos in silver frames, of comrades – dead or alive? \n
or did it matter? In his late fifties or even early sixties, \n
some inner torment of his memories transcended, \n
he surprised us all by marrying happily and producing \n
a large family. And once again, we had little clue \n
about the war he fought; or whether the nights \n
brought him tormented dreams… \n
We were taught by heroes who were asked to hold \n
more than any man or woman should be asked to hold: \n
do we wish – or should we wish – \n
that we knew then what we guess now? \n
They, teaching us from all their memories of hideous war, \n
how to grow up in peace; only to see \n
a generation of those same boys and girls \n
demanded by another war.. \n
Autumn again; brown leaves fall like green lives; \n
soon, November mists and poppies \n
red as blood, red as children’s blood \n
from a terrible union, of heroism and futility \n
called war. \n<|endoftext|>

In fifty years, when peace outshines \n
Remembrance of the battle lines, \n
Adventurous lads will sigh and cast \n
Proud looks upon the plundered past. \n
On summer morn or winter's night, \n
Their hearts will kindle for the fight, \n
Reading a snatch of soldier-song, \n
Savage and jaunty, fierce and strong; \n
And through the angry marching rhymes \n
Of blind regret and haggard mirth, \n
They'll envy us the dazzling times \n
When sacrifice absolved our earth. \n
Some ancient man with silver locks \n
Will lift his weary face to say: \n
'War was a fiend who stopped our clocks \n
Although we met him grim and gay.' \n
And then he'll speak of Haig's last drive, \n
Marvelling that any came alive \n
Out of the shambles that men built \n
And smashed, to cleanse the world of guilt. \n
But the boys, with grin and sidelong glance, \n
Will think, 'Poor grandad's day is done.' \n
And dream of lads who fought in France \n
And lived in time to share the fun. \n<|endoftext|>

The joyous new year revellers were making lots of noise \n
And at midnight they sang and cheered and fireworks lit the skies \n
But one teenager with heaving guts perhaps from too much beer \n
Was spewing on the side walk at the birth of a new year. \n
Too drunk for to be merry and too sick to enjoy \n
The new year celebrations and to bid the old goodbye \n
Perhaps she spent her new year hung over feeling fuzzy in the head \n
With very little energy recovering in her bed. \n
Her body had rejected some of the poison she had taken in \n
And she could have chose a better way for her new year to begin \n
A young woman in her late teens and at the age of choice \n
And for over indulgence one might say there is a price. \n
The biggest party of any year for all to celebrate \n
And even strangers greeted me with a happy new year mate \n
And lots of new year revellry and happiness and joy \n
And smiles and mirth and laughter were in plentiful supply. \n
But I saw one young woman quite oblivious to it all \n
Bent over on the side walk by a brick garden wall \n
With her heaving guts expelling some of the poison she had taken in \n
She might have chosen a more pleasant way for her new year to begin. \n<|endoftext|>

A lion sunk by time's decay, \n
Too feeble grown to hunt his prey, \n
Observed his fatal hour draw nigh: \n
He drooped and laid him down to die. \n
There came by chance a savage boar, \n
Who trembled oft to hear him roar, \n
But when he saw him thus distressed \n
He tore and gored his royal breast. \n
A bull came next (ungen'rous foe), \n
Rejoiced to find him fall'n so low, \n
And with his horny-armed head \n
He aimed at once to strike him dead, - \n
He strikes, he wounds, he shocks in vain, \n
The lion still conceals his pain. \n
At length a base inglorious ass, \n
Who saw so many insults pass, \n
Came up and kicked him in the side: \n
'Twas this that raised the lion's pride. \n
He roused, and thus he spoke at length, \n
For indignation gave him strength: \n
Thou sorry, stupid, sluggish creature, \n
Disgrace and shame and scorn of nature! \n
You saw how well I could dispense \n
With blows from beasts of consequence! \n
They dignified the wounds they gave; \n
For none complain who feel the brave. \n
But you, the lowest of all brutes, \n
How ill your face with courage suits! \n
What dullness in thy looks appears! \n
I'd rather far (by heav'n 'tis true) \n
Expire by these than live by you: \n
A kick from thee is double death - \n
I curse thee with my dying breath! \n

My impoverished muse, alas! What have you for me this morning? \n
Your empty eyes are stocked with nocturnal visions, \n
In your cheek's cold and taciturn reflection, \n
I see insanity and horror forming. \n
The green succubus and the red urchin, \n
Have they poured you fear and love from their urns? \n
The nightmare of a mutinous fist that despotically turns, \n
Does it drown you at the bottom of a loch beyond searching? \n
I wish that your breast exhaled the scent of sanity, \n
That your womb of thought was not a tomb more frequently \n
And that your Christian blood flowed around a buoy that was rhythmical, \n
Like the numberless sounds of antique syllables, \n
Where reigns in turn the father of songs, \n
Phoebus, and the great Pan, the harvest sovereign. \n

The urge of the prince \n
To go around more places, \n
The King understood well. \n
Perhaps, it was God’s will. \n
Next, the prince went out \n
From the South gate, \n
And found a sickly man \n
Groaning with severe pain. \n
He asked his charioteer, \n
“What made this man suffer? ” \n
Charioteer gave him the reason, \n
“He’s sick, suffering with pain.” \n
The prince asked him again \n
“Why he’s having pain? \n
How he fell into sickness? \n
Why he’s in distress? ” \n
The charioteer explained \n
“Any being, young or old, \n
Rich or poor, wise or fool, \n
Into sickness, one can fall.” \n
Siddhartha felt then \n
“If there’s room for this pain, \n
It ends in one’s suffering, \n
So, pleasure has no meaning.” \n
They returned to the palace. \n
His mind then became restless. \n
For the mentally disturbed prince, \n
It was another painful experience \n
From the West gate, \n
Once again, he set out \n
Not far away from the palace, \n
A crowd moved in slow pace. \n
Four men carried a corpse \n
O’er their shoulders. \n
The men behind cried \n
As they closely followed. \n
To the prince it was \n
A third experience. \n
The charioteer this time, \n
Briefly explained to him. \n
“There comes death \n
After every birth. \n
This is the truth \n
Of life and death.” \n
The prince said, “Then \n
The whole world is an illusion! \n
For what’s unseen, is real! \n
And what’s seen is unreal! ” \n<|endoftext|>

sick \n
With the light of the day, and the promices you made, to the memories of the future, and you just keep them all inside, emotions, life, love and respect, both you and me, we both fall to the floor, and you spring up, while im trapped in this memory, keeping a steady pace as you walk away and i just close my eyes, trying to hold the weight of the world on my shoulders, im not upset, im not angry, im not gonna let you take me down, gain access to my heart, and hurt me again, your trying to pretend your someone your not anymore, and with the way i feel, it will seal your fate, and when things go wrong, your prtend it's not real, you distance yourself, and put up a fake face, just to get into me, engulf my heart, and charr it, I won't let you, im weighing my options, no matter what you say, ill never be there with you, im not your puppet, you dream of tomorrow, another day to infect me with you virus, i evolve to be immune to your sickness. \n<|endoftext|>
sick \n
'Tis sweet to him, who all the week \n
Through city-crowds must push his way, \n
To stroll alone through fields and woods, \n
And hallow thus the Sabbath-day. \n
And sweet it is, in summer bower, \n
Sincere, affectionate and gay, \n
One's own dear children feasting round, \n
To celebrate one's marriage-day. \n
But what is all, to his delight, \n
Who having long been dommed to roam, \n
Throws off the bundle from his back, \n
Before the door of his own home? \n
Home-sickness is a wasting pang; \n
This feel I hourly more and more: \n
There's healing only in thy wings, \n
Thou Breeze that play'st on Albion's shore! \n<|endoftext|>
sick \n
The sick wind moans, moans the sick wind \n
There mystery lies in its every moan: \n
It tells all and nothing yet it tells \n
How careful hides it the secret in its breast. \n
The old oak hears the sick wind \n
And hearing it understands its own \n
And weeps the old oak without a cry. \n<|endoftext|>
sick \n
My pillow is so wet, \n
my eyes are too red. \n
my soul is wounded and hurt, \n
I shouldn't have listened to my heart's alert. \n
I am a victim of love, \n
I am weak, I'm a dove. \n
scold me, hang me and shoot me to death, \n
I am sorry I have fallen in your love in this earth. \n
stretch your delicate hands, pluck out that damned heart, \n
Burn it, melt like ice and take it apart. \n
Purified heart, only then I can stop loving you, \n
You are a snapshot of heaven's view. \n
I cann't take my eyes from yours, \n
you're the one I chose. \n
I'll love you now and after I am not alive, \n
Your lovely smile inspires me my whole life. \n
I am crazy about your eyes, \n
that have many ties to heaven and skies. \n
free your soul, let it embrace mine, \n
This is how I felt when I met u the first time. \n
When I experience the softness of your rosy lips, \n
my heart goes out of my chest and slips. \n
you're the perfect combination of sexy and cute, \n
Hold my hand warmly and let's take our fated route. \n
I am old, a worn-out patient. \n
Hold me so tight, you're my last love station. \n
Whisper in my ear. \n
Let me enjoy and hear, \n
the soft sound of your voice, \n
love me, hold me and rejoice. \n<|endoftext|>

sick \n
Have you ever been sick? \n
Walked that hospital floor with a stick \n
Have you ever been sick? \n
Had an operation painted graphically horrific \n
My knees, weak they felt \n
I heard their voices melt \n
Into pain from poor health \n
For them rebirth or death sickness spelt \n
Suddenly I realized life is not static \n
While listening to a tale so tragic \n
A mother cried at sicknesses trick \n
Her family of four it decided to pick \n
At any time we can lose \n
Anyone sickness decides to abuse! \n
Have you ever been sick? \n
In vain visited numerous clinics \n
Have you ever been sick? \n
Wondering where life will next kick \n
Have you ever had a cough? \n
Thinking you are having it so rough \n
Have you ever suffered from heat? \n
Knowing others gave up there in defeat \n
Have you suffered from cuts? \n
Or open wounds that severely hurt \n
Have you ever looked at the sick? \n
And thought anyone of them eccentric \n
Health is wealth and good health for sure \n
Is created by thoughts that are deemed pure \n
While the clock goes tick-tock-tick \n
If you ever find yourself sick \n
It helps to eliminate the negative traffic \n
With more than just a mere flick \n

river \n
Down through bare fields and by many a hedgerow the streams from the high country flow \n
Down to join and swell the big river that into a huge water-way grow \n
On it's long journey to the ocean it babbles along night and day \n
From it's birth-place in the high valley saltwater seems quite a long way, \n
It has outlived generations of people the Seasons they come and they go \n
How old is the very old river the answer anyone does not know \n
Perhaps it has been flowing forever millions of years before the first human was born \n
By the hedges and through the old fields forever it has babbled on since time's first morn, \n
The old poets have sung of the river the river that has not aged in time \n
Their bones long resting in Earth's bosom and the river will outlive their rhyme \n
It babbles on downland forever from the high Country to the vast sea \n
And when people talk of the river they do not talk of mortality, \n
The human life span it seems such a short span the Seasons they come and they go \n
But the river born in the high country forever to the ocean flow. \n<|endoftext|>

Dear native Brook! wild Streamlet of the West! \n
How many various-fated years have past, \n
What happy and what mournful hours, since last \n
I skimm'd the smooth thin stone along thy breast, \n
Numbering its light leaps! yet so deep imprest \n
Sink the sweet scenes of childhood, that mine eyes \n
I never shut amid the sunny ray, \n
But straight with all their tints thy waters rise, \n
Thy crossing plank, thy marge with willows grey, \n
And bedded sand that vein'd with various dyes \n
Gleam'd through thy bright transparence! On my way, \n
Visions of Childhood! oft have ye beguil'd \n
Lone manhood's cares, yet waking fondest sighs: \n
Ah! that once more I were a careless Child! \n<|endoftext|>

from below the bridge between the \n
Central Market and the Dayubumi \n

the rain has stopped, and your \n

The more we live, more brief appear \n
Our life's succeeding stages; \n
A day to childhood seems a year, \n
And years like passing ages. \n
The gladsome current of our youth, \n
Ere passion yet disorders, \n
Steals lingering like a river smooth \n
Along its grassy borders. \n
But as the careworn cheek grows wan, \n
And sorrow's shafts fly thicker, \n
Ye stars, that measure life to man, \n
Why seem your courses quicker? \n
When joys have lost their bloom and breath, \n
And life itself is vapid, \n
Why, as we reach the Falls of Death \n
Feel we its tide more rapid? \n
It may be strange—yet who would change \n
Time's course to slower speeding, \n
When one by one our friends have gone, \n
And left our bosoms bleeding? \n
Heaven gives our years of fading strength \n
Indemnifying fleetness; \n
And those of youth, a seeming length, \n
Proportion'd to their sweetness. \n<|endoftext|>

The Pyramids at a distance \n
Fishermen in rickety feluccas \n
A blazing September sunset \n
And you sitting next to me \n
Your face touched with a smile \n
Questions and confessions \n
Musings and impressions \n
Self-expression without permission \n
Soul searching free of inhibition \n
First experiences with no apprehension \n
Bliss and content beyond comprehension \n
Time frozen as emotions flow \n
A sense of security with an afterglow \n
Feelings soaring in crescendo \n
Tender words and sweet innuendo \n
Stolen moments to forever cherish \n
Shared memories that will never perish \n<|endoftext|>
river \n
We sink into the dust, \n
Baba and me, \n
Beneath brush of prickly leaves; \n
Ivy strangling trees--singing \n
Our last rites of locura. \n
Homeboys. Worshipping God-fumes \n
Out of spray cans. \n
Our backs press up against \n
A corrugated steel fence \n
Along the dried banks \n
Of a concrete river. \n
Spray-painted outpourings \n
On walls offer a chaos \n
Of color for the eyes. \n
Home for now. Hidden in weeds. \n
Furnished with stained mattresses \n
And plastic milk crates. \n
Wood planks thrust into \n
thick branches \n
serve as roof. \n
The door is a torn cloth curtain \n
(knock before entering). \n
Home for now, sandwiched \n
In between the maddening days. \n
We aim spray into paper bags. \n
Suckle them. Take deep breaths. \n
An echo of steel-sounds grates the sky. \n
Home for now. Along an urban-spawned \n
Stream of muck, we gargle in \n
The technicolor synthesized madness. \n
This river, this concrete river, \n
Becomes a steaming, bubbling \n
Snake of water, pouring over \n
Nightmares of wakefulness; \n
Pouring out a rush of birds; \n
A flow of clear liquid \n
On a cloudless day. \n
Not like the black oil stains we lie in, \n
Not like the factory air engulfing us; \n
Not this plastic death in a can. \n
Sun rays dance on the surface. \n
Gray fish fidget below the sheen. \n
And us looking like Huckleberry Finns/ \n
Tom Sawyers, with stick fishing poles, \n
As dew drips off low branches \n
As if it were earth's breast milk. \n
Oh, we should be novas of our born days. \n
We should be scraping wet dirt \n
with callused toes. \n
We should be flowering petals \n
playing ball. \n
Soon water/fish/dew wane into \n
A pulsating whiteness. \n
I enter a tunnel of circles, \n
Swimming to a glare of lights. \n
Family and friends beckon me. \n
I want to be there, \n
In perpetual dreaming; \n
In the din of exquisite screams. \n
I want to know this mother-comfort \n
Surging through me. \n
I am a sliver of blazing ember \n
entering a womb of brightness. \n
I am a hovering spectre shedding \n
scarred flesh. \n
I am a clown sneaking out of a painted \n
mouth in the sky. \n
I am your son, amá, seeking \n
the security of shadows, \n
fleeing weary eyes \n
bursting brown behind \n
a sewing machine. \n
I am your brother, the one you \n
threw off rooftops, tore into \n
with rage--the one you visited, \n
a rag of a boy, lying \n
in a hospital bed, ruptured. \n
I am friend of books, prey of cops, \n
lover of the barrio women \n
selling hamburgers and tacos \n
at the P&G Burger Stand. \n
I welcome this heavy shroud. \n
I want to be buried in it-- \n
To be sculptured marble \n
In craftier hands. \n
Soon an electrified hum sinks teeth \n
Into brain--then claws \n
Surround me, pull at me, \n
Back to the dust, to the concrete river. \n
Let me go!--to stay entangled \n
In this mesh of barbed serenity! \n
But over me is a face, \n
Mouth breathing back life. \n
I feel the gush of air, \n
The pebbles and debris beneath me. \n
"Give me the bag, man," I slur. \n
"No way! You died, man," Baba said. \n
"You stopped breathing and died." \n
"I have to go back!...you don't \n
understand..." \n
I try to get up, to reach the sky. \n
Oh, for the lights--for this whore \n
of a Sun, \n
To blind me. To entice me to burn. \n
Come back! Let me swing in delight \n
To the haunting knell, \n
To pierce colors of virgin skies. \n
Not here, along a concrete river, \n
But there--licked by tongues of flame! \n<|endoftext|>
river \n
The river below us: \n
nitrogen, phosphorous, petrochemicals, \n
dioxin from the paper mills, \n
a rich buffet of metals digested \n
from the mines, and still we remain \n
oblivious to its symptoms \n
until a skull-and-crossbones sign warns \n
of the poisons that run the course \n
of its slim body, writhing like a patient \n
on a gurney, admitted for treatment; \n
warns too, of its offspring \n
in the waiting room: soft-shell crabs, oysters, \n
the striped bass, the silk fillet, \n
and the trout we want to bring home \n
to the sizzle of butter and garlic \n
and the fresh herbs in the kitchen. \n
And suddenly we are left alone \n
to recover mere memory: the river \n
we had swung across on ropes \n
in the dungarees of childhood, \n
splashing in its shallow gut; the river \n
over which we fought and killed— \n
and for which we even died— \n
the river we damned. \n<|endoftext|>
river \n
Remember the folks who first came to our shores, \n
Fleeing from floods, famine, starvation and wars. \n
Remember they cleared the forests, pushed back the sea. \n
They braved the storms and swamps, and built the place that is home to me. \n
Lady River, your beauty shone and lived on. \n
Though you might haunt, yet neither tease nor taunt. \n
How they came - just the same, \n
Not minding the rugged hills, and nature untame. \n
Lady River, you`ve launched a thousand ships from distant shores, \n
Like the Grecian beauty the ancients loved, and the modern man adores. \n
Thousands of junks, bum-boats, lighters nestled around, \n
And coolies carrying cargo crates abound. \n
But like unwelcome guests, they were soon gone, \n
Leaving behind worn-down warehouses that drew a yawn, \n
Now you`re very clean; even pristine, \n
As the twinkling skyline of affluence hems you in. \n
Then urban renewal plunged right in - dazzling your tearless eyes. \n
Its magic wand changed all - to modernise or harmonise. \n
Even the Merlion spewing water from its mouth has shifted. \n
You`ve survived and thrived - your history and tradition lifted. \n
You`ve watched time wink - its tricks you understand - \n
Whatever the fetish, fad or new trend. \n
Whatever slogan, jargon, or dish delicious - \n
They`re sometimes serious, often hilarious. \n
Your weary eyes have seen armies, and statesmen, \n
Suicides of forlorn coolies and depressed steersmen, \n
Floating bodies of executed spies and war victims, \n
Choirs and orchestras with their stirring music or hymns. \n
You have witnessed senseless invasions, occupations and reoccupations; \n
Mergers and acquisitions, debates and discussions; \n
The economy`s boom and gloom and recession; \n
And urban changes with conservation and preservation. \n
O Lady River, the fleeting years have not dimmed your complexion. \n
Twelve tall bridges are still your constant companion. \n
History and heritage charter your course and give direction. \n
Footsteps along your banks quietly follow your tradition. \n<|endoftext|>

Inhale the bird infested air \n
of clearer blue and high up there \n
free to soar the highest heights \n
a brighter day as one takes flight. \n
The heron builds a mighty nest \n
and seagulls plague us overhead! \n
Wild yellow iris fill the banks, \n
in spring, the Lord is given thanks. \n
As river flows around the bend \n
perfection reflected; sunlight sends \n
and man created paint and brush \n
to capture the views colorful, lush. \n
Painted river boats and barges, \n
sailing craft of varied sizes \n
and floating buss' run on time; \n
canoe or pleasure where we may dine. \n
So run, run by the riverside \n
upon a time a French King's pride. \n
Cycle paths and dogs who linger. \n
Glisten, glitter, row the river. \n
For Egal Bohen. \n

In my first sleep \n
I came to the river \n
And looked down \n
Through the clear water - \n
Only in dream \n
Water so pure, \n
Laced and undulant \n
Lines of flow \n
On its rocky bed \n
Water of life \n
Streaming for ever. \n
A house was there \n
Beside the river \n
And I, arrived, \n
An expected guest \n
About to explore \n
Old gardens and libraries - \n
But the car was waiting \n
To drive me away. \n
One last look \n
Into that bright stream - \n
Trout there were \n
And clear on the bottom \n
Monster form \n
Of the great crayfish \n
That crawls to the moon. \n
On its rocky bed \n
Living water \n
In whorls and ripples \n
Flowing unbended. \n
There was the car \n
To drive me away. \n
We crossed the river \n
Of living water - \n
I might not stay, \n
But must return \n
By the road too short \n
To the waiting day. \n
In my second dream \n
Pure I was and free \n
By the rapid stream, \n
My crystal house the sky, \n
The pure crystalline sky. \n
Into the stream I flung \n
A bottle of clear glass \n
That twirled and tossed and spun \n
In the water's race \n
Flashing the morning sun. \n
Down that swift river \n
I saw it borne away, \n
My empty crystal form, \n
Exultant saw it caught \n
Into the current's spin, \n
The flashing water's run. \n<|endoftext|>

As I stood upon the Dean Bridge and viewed the beautiful scenery, \n
I felt fascinated and my heart was full of glee, \n
And I exclaimed in an ecstasy of delight, \n
In all my travels I never saw such a sight. \n
The scenery is so enchanting to look upon \n
That all tourists will say, "Dull care, be gone." \n
'Tis certainly a most lovely spot, \n
And once seen it can never be forgot. \n
Then away! away! to the River of Leith, \n
That springs from the land of heather and heath, \n
And view the gorgeous scenery on a fine summer day. \n
I'm sure it will drive dull care away. \n
The water-fall near the Bridge is most beautiful to be seen, \n
As it falls and shines like crystal in the sunsheen; \n
And the sound can be heard all day long, \n
While the innocent trouts sing an aquatic song. \n
The glen is a cool spot in the summer time. \n
There the people can be shaded from the sunshine \n
Under the spreading branches of the big trees, \n
And there's seats there to rest on if they please. \n
Then near St. Bernard's Well there's a shady bower, \n
Where the lovers, if they like, can spend an hour; \n
And while they rest there at their ease \n
They can make love to each other if they please. \n
The water of St. Bernard's Well is very nice, \n
But to get a drink of it one penny is the price. \n
I think in justice the price is rather high, \n
To give a penny for a drink when one feels dry. \n
The braes of the River Leith is most charming to be seen, \n
With its beautiful trees and shrubberies green, \n
And as the tourist gazes on the river in the valley below, \n
His heart with joy feels all aglow. \n
There the little trouts do sport and play \n
During the live-long summer day, \n
While the bee and butterfly is on the wing, \n
And with the singing of birds the glen doth ring. \n
The walk underneath the Dean Bridge is lovely to see. \n
And as ye view the scenery it will fill your heart with glee. \n
It is good for the people's health to be walking there \n
As they gaze on the beauties of Nature and inhale pure air. \n
The Dean Bridge is a very magnificent sight, \n
Because from the basement it is a great height. \n
And it seems most attractive to the eye, \n
And arrests the attention of strangers as they pass by. \n
The braes of Belgrave Crescent is lovely to see, \n
With its beautiful walks and green shrubbery. \n
'Tis health for the people that lives near by there \n
To walk along the bonny walks and breathe the sweet air. \n
Therefore all lovers of the picturesque, bo advised by me \n
And the beautiful scenery of the River Leith go and see, \n
And I am sure you will get a very great treat, \n
Because the River of Leith scenery cannot be beat. \n<|endoftext|>

After Li Po \n
While my hair was still cut straight \n
across my forehead \n
I played at the front gate, pulling \n
flowers. \n
You came by on bamboo stilts, playing \n
horse, \n
You walked about my seat, playing with \n
blue plums. \n
And we went on living in the village of \n
Chokan: \n
Two small people, without dislike or \n
suspicion. \n
At fourteen I married My Lord you. \n
I never laughed, being bashful. \n
Lowering my head, I looked at the wall. \n
Called to, a thousand times, I never \n
looked back. \n
At fifteen I stopped scowling, \n
I desired my dust to be mingled with \n
yours \n
Forever and forever and forever. \n
Why should I climb the lookout? \n
At sixteen you departed, \n
You went into far Ku-to-en, by the river \n
of swirling eddies, \n
And you have been gone five months. \n
The monkeys make sorrowful noise \n
overhead. \n
You dragged your feet when you went \n
out, \n
By the gate now, the moss is grown, \n
the different mosses, \n
Too deep to clear them away! \n
The leaves fall early this autumn, in \n
wind. \n
The paired butterflies are already \n
yellow with August \n
Over the grass in the West garden; \n
They hurt me. I grow older. \n
If you are coming down through the \n
narrows of the river Kiang, \n
Please let me know beforehand, \n
And I will come out to meet you \n
As far as Cho-fu-sa. \n

BANKERS TRUST AUTOMOBILE LOAN \n
You'll find a banker at Bankers Trust" \n
Advertisement in N.Y. Times \n
When comes my second childhood, \n
As to all men it must, \n
I want to be a banker \n
Like the banker at Bankers Trust. \n
I wouldn't ask to be president \n
Or even assistant veep, \n
I'd only ask for a kiddie car \n
And permission to go beep-beep. \n
The banker at Chase Manhattan, \n
He bids a polite Good-day; \n
The banker at Immigrant Savings \n
Cries Scusi! and Olé! \n
But I'd be a sleek Ferrari \n
Or perhaps a joggly jeep, \n
And scooting around at Bankers Trust, \n
Beep-beep, I'd go, beep-beep. \n
The trolley car used to say clang-clang \n
And the choo-choo said toot-toot, \n
But the beep of the banker at Bankers Trust \n
Is every bit as cute. \n
Miaow, says the cuddly kitten, \n
Baa, says the woolly sheep, \n
Oink, says the piggy-wiggy, \n
And the banker says beep-beep. \n
So I want to play at Bankers Trust \n
Like a hippety-hoppety bunny, \n
And best of all, oh best of all, \n
With really truly money. \n
Now grown-ups dear, it's nightie-night \n
Until my dream comes true, \n
And I bid you a happy boop-a-doop \n
And a big beep-beep adieu. \n<|endoftext|>

Open your eyes and you will see, \n
Just how beautiful our earth can be. \n
No animal would ever be rare, \n
If everyone would try to care. \n
Trees would not be lying dead, \n
And all of earth's animals would be fed. \n
All of the bears would have plenty of honey, \n
And there would even be carrots for every bunny. \n
If everyone picked up one piece of trash, \n
Our litter problem would be gone in a flash. \n
Tomorrow take a good look at the sky's new dawn, \n
And realize someday all of this might be gone. \n
Remember the important part that you play, \n
In saving our planet for a future day. \n
Our childrens' eyes with your help will see, \n
Just how beautiful our earth can be. \n<|endoftext|>

If I were twenty-one today, \n
I think I'd dance the night away. \n
I'd drink champagne and polish off \n
Half a bottle of the best Smirnoff. \n

And trust my friends to carry me home. \n
My coming of age they'd never forget \n
Nor I remember, you can bet. \n

today \n
The gold-hoarder walked in his palace park and with him walked his troubles. And over his head hovered worries as a vulture hovers over a carcass, until he reached a beautiful lake surrounded by magnificent marble statuary. \n
He sat there pondering the water which poured from the mouths of the statues like thoughts flowing freely from a lover's imagination, and contemplating heavily his palace which stood upon a knoll like a birth-mark upon the cheek of a maiden. His fancy revealed to him the pages of his life's drama which he read with falling tears that veiled his eyes and prevented him from viewing man's feeble additions to Nature. \n
He looked back with piercing regret to the images of his early life, woven into pattern by the gods, until he could no longer control his anguish. He said aloud, "Yesterday I was grazing my sheep in the green valley, enjoying my existence, sounding my flute, and holding my head high. Today I am a prisoner of greed. Gold leads into gold, then into restlessness and finally into crushing misery. \n
"Yesterday I was like a singing bird, soaring freely here and there in the fields. Today I am a slave to fickle wealth, society's rules, and city's customs, and purchased friends, pleasing the people by conforming to the strange and narrow laws of man. I was born to be free and enjoy the bounty of life, but I find myself like a beast of burden so heavily laden with gold that his back is breaking. \n
"Where are the spacious plains, the singing brooks, the pure breeze, the closeness of Nature? Where is my deity? I have lost all! Naught remains save loneliness that saddens me, gold that ridicules me, slaves who curse to my back, and a palace that I have erected as a tomb for my happiness, and in whose greatness I have lost my heart. \n
"Yesterday I roamed the prairies and the hills together with the Bedouin's daughter; Virtue was our companion, Love our delight, and the moon our guardian. Today I am among women with shallow beauty who sell themselves for gold and diamonds. \n
"Yesterday I was carefree, sharing with the shepherds all the joy of life; eating, playing, working, singing, and dancing together to the music of the heart's truth. Today I find myself among the people like a frightened lamb among the wolves. As I walk in the roads, they gaze at me with hateful eyes and point at me with scorn and jealousy, and as I steal through the park I see frowning faces all about me. \n
"Yesterday I was rich in happiness and today I am poor in gold. \n
"Yesterday I was a happy shepherd looking upon his head as a merciful king looks with pleasure upon his contented subjects. Today I am a slave standing before my wealth, my wealth which robbed me of the beauty of life I once knew. \n
"Forgive me, my Judge! I did not know that riches would put my life in fragments and lead me into the dungeons of harshness and stupidity. What I thought was glory is naught but an eternal inferno." \n
He gathered himself wearily and walked slowly toward the palace, sighing and repeating, "Is this what people call wealth? Is this the god I am serving and worshipping? Is this what I seek of the earth? Why can I not trade it for one particle of contentment? Who would sell me one beautiful thought for a ton of gold? Who would give me one moment of love for a handful of gems? Who would grant me an eye that can see others' hearts, and take all my coffers in barter?" \n
As he reached the palace gates he turned and looked toward the city as Jeremiah gazed toward Jerusalem. He raised his arms in woeful lament and shouted, "Oh people of the noisome city, who are living in darkness, hastening toward misery, preaching falsehood, and speaking with stupidity...until when shall you remain ignorant? Unit when shall you abide in the filth of life and continue to desert its gardens? Why wear you tattered robes of narrowness while the silk raiment of Nature's beauty is fashioned for you? The lamp of wisdom is dimming; it is time to furnish it with oil. The house of true fortune is being destroyed; it is time to rebuild it and guard it. The thieves of ignorance have stolen the treasure of your peace; it is time to retake it!" \n
At that moment a poor man stood before him and stretched forth his hand for alms. As he looked at the beggar, his lips parted, his eyes brightened with a softness, and his face radiated kindness. It was as if the yesterday he had lamented by the lake had come to greet him. He embraced the pauper with affection and filled his hands with gold, and with a voice sincere with the sweetness of love he said, "Come back tomorrow and bring with you your fellow sufferers. All your possessions will be restored." \n
He entered his palace saying, "Everything in life is good; even gold, for it teaches a lesson. Money is like a stringed instrument; he who does not know how to use it properly will hear only discordant music. Money is like love; it kills slowly and painfully the one who withholds it, and it enlivens the other who turns it upon his fellow man." \n<|endoftext|>

God, thwart the moves of men with minds insane; \n
Their corruption has reached enormous heights; \n
And masking all their crimes, righteous they feign; \n
Ill-gotten wealth, giving them sleepless nights! \n
How long this land can bear their insults, Lord? \n
How longer must the poor suffer hard-ships? \n
The corrupt own most resources, O God; \n
Most transactions are carried out by ‘tips’! \n
The people have been cheated for ages; \n
The poor are made poorer by corrupt men; \n
The employees get paid paltry wages. \n
For honest folk, the earth is no haven! \n
Most lives are endangered by corruption; \n
The world does need a cleansing eruption! \n

For the first time they took me out into the sun today. \n
And for the first time in my life I was aghast \n

and so vast \n
I stood there without a motion. \n
Then I sat on the ground with respectful devotion \n
leaning against the white wall. \n
Who cares about the waves with which I yearn to roll \n
Or about strife or freedom or my wife right now. \n
The soil, the sun and me... \n
I feel joyful and how. \n

The world around look so topsy-turvy! \n
Nothing is permanent or ultimate; \n
Gone are the days of dropsy and scurvy; \n
Now people think they can all levitate. \n
And politics invades all other fields; \n
Most nations are riddled by corruption; \n
Black-money, clout and ‘goondas’ power wields; \n
Nothing happens by mere assumption. \n
Red-tapism has people on their knees; \n
Professionals have been much humbled oft; \n
Both individuals and nations have no peace; \n
To acts of injustice, God appears soft! \n
O God, when will an order new set in? \n
When will all earthlings shun away from sin? \n<|endoftext|>

People tell lies to men and to themselves; \n
People well-off, appear to be in strife; \n

The world is bad and so people turn bad; \n
The world isn’t true and so people are not; \n

Today is that day \n
not on the calendar, \n
as National Olfactory Day, \n
but far more exciting than that: \n
the day when scent, fragrance, smell, \n
awoke on the warm sunlit air from a winter's sleep \n
and out of nowhere easily spoken of \n
produced a whole new world. \n
The first shock was the hedge two doors down \n
which yesterday was a green hedge with white bits \n
but today a burst of fragrance, a Hallelujah Chorus \n
transcribed to be played with or on or in the nose. \n
The restaurant two blocks up \n
unleashed from its kitchen \n
garlic that burst out like a bunch of singing nudists into the street \n
cavorting shamelessly and shouting to the world \n
every Mediterranean memory \n
of romantic meals and much else \n
that one thought private. \n
Then subtle smells that made one into a cat or dog \n
pursuing trails not on the street map \n
and making beaten tracks into voyages of discovery: \n
the baker's became a European trip of fresh morning bread \n
with another hundred freeze-dried memories unloosed; \n
And all down the street, \n
other people's lunches opened their front doors \n
and said 'Come and join us! We're having roast beef today \n
with all the trimmings, and we've enough smell \n
to feed the five thousand! ' \n
and a hundred gardens one thought dormant \n
leaned on the front gate \n
and exchanged the time of year with a childlike innocence \n
that couldn't be told to come inside this minute or else, \n
and presented nosegays to strangers \n
without asking for a contribution to a cause. \n
A day for bringing past happinesses out from the store cupboard \n
and giving them a shake and leaving them on the line \n
until the sunlight moves off \n
and the air leaves them cooler and even fresher; \n
and wondering whom one will be tomorrow, \n
if one can feel like this today. \n<|endoftext|>

laundry baskets that smell as if \n

the smell of love and motherhood \n
the hot iron’s steamy smell \n

today \n
They came from the lower levels \n
Deep down in the Brilliant mine; \n
From the wastes where the whirlwind revels, \n
Whirling the leaves of pine. \n
On the western plains, where the Darling flows, \n
And the dust storms wheel and shift, \n
The teamster loosened his yokes and bows, \n
And turned his team adrift. \n
On the western stations, far and wide, \n
There's many an empty pen, \n
For the "ringers" have cast the machines aside \n
And answered the call for men. \n
On the lucerne flats where the stream runs slow, \n
And the Hunter finds the sea, \n
The women are driving the mowers now, \n
With the children at their knee. \n
For the men have gone, as a man must go, \n
At the call of the rolling drums; \n
For the men have sworn that the Turks shall know \n
When the old battalion comes. \n
Column of companies by the right, \n
Steady in strong array, \n
With the sun on the bayonets gleaming bright, \n
The battalion marched away. \n
They battled, the old battalion, \n
Through the toil of the training camps, \n
Sweated and strove at lectures, \n
By the light of the stinking lamps. \n
Marching, shooting, and drilling; \n
Steady and slow and stern; \n
Awkward and strange, but willing \n
All of their job to learn. \n
Learning to use the rifle; \n
Learning to use the spade; \n
Deeming fatigue a trifle \n
During each long parade. \n
Till at last they welded \n
Into a concrete whole, \n
And there grew in the old battalion \n
A kind of battalion's soul. \n
Brotherhood never was like it; \n
Friendship is not the word; \n
But deep in that body of marching men \n
The soul of a nation stirred. \n
And like one man with a single thought \n
Cheery and confident; \n
Ready for all that the future brought, \n
The old battalion went. \n
Column of companies by the right, \n
Steady in strong array, \n
With the sun on the bayonets gleaming bright, \n
The battalion marched away. \n
How shall we tell of the landing \n
By the hills where the foe were spread, \n
And the track of the old battalion \n
Was marked by the Turkish dead? \n
With the dash that discipline teaches, \n
Though the hail of the shrapnel flew, \n
And the forts were raking the beaches, \n
And the toll of the dead men grew. \n
They fixed their grip on the gaunt hillside \n
With a pluck that has won them fame; \n
And the home-folks know that the dead men died \n
For the pride of Australia's name. \n
Column of companies by the right, \n
To the beat of the rolling drums; \n
With honours gained in a stirring fight \n
The old battalion comes! \n<|endoftext|>

Tears in his eyes quench the amazing light, \n
Blood fills his frowns, which from his pierced head fell. \n
And can that tongue adjudge thee unto hell, \n
Which prayed forgiveness for his foes' fierce spite? \n
No, no; but as in my idolatry \n

Beauty, of pity, foulness only is \n

night \n
In the secular night you wander around \n
alone in your house. It's two-thirty. \n
Everyone has deserted you, \n
or this is your story; \n
you remember it from being sixteen, \n
when the others were out somewhere, having a good time, \n
or so you suspected, \n
and you had to baby-sit. \n
You took a large scoop of vanilla ice-cream \n
and filled up the glass with grapejuice \n
and ginger ale, and put on Glenn Miller \n
with his big-band sound, \n
and lit a cigarette and blew the smoke up the chimney, \n
and cried for a while because you were not dancing, \n
and then danced, by yourself, your mouth circled with purple. \n
Now, forty years later, things have changed, \n
and it's baby lima beans. \n
It's necessary to reserve a secret vice. \n
This is what comes from forgetting to eat \n
at the stated mealtimes. You simmer them carefully, \n
drain, add cream and pepper, \n
and amble up and down the stairs, \n
scooping them up with your fingers right out of the bowl, \n
talking to yourself out loud. \n
You'd be surprised if you got an answer, \n
but that part will come later. \n
There is so much silence between the words, \n
you say. You say, The sensed absence \n
of God and the sensed presence \n
amount to much the same thing, \n
only in reverse. \n
You say, I have too much white clothing. \n
You start to hum. \n
Several hundred years ago \n
this could have been mysticism \n
or heresy. It isn't now. \n
Outside there are sirens. \n
Someone's been run over. \n
The century grinds on. \n<|endoftext|>
night \n
To slip into your shadow under cover of night. \n
To follow your footsteps, your shadow at the window. \n
That shadow at the window is you and no one else; \n
it's you. \n
Do not open that window behind whose curtains you're moving. \n
Shut your eyes. \n
I'd like to shut them with my lips. \n
But the window opens and the breeze, the breeze \n
which strangely balances flame and flag surrounds my escape \n
with its cloak. \n
The window opens: it's not you. \n
I knew it all along. \n<|endoftext|>
night \n
Silent, silent night, \n
Quench the holy light \n
Of thy torches bright; \n
For possessed of Day \n
Thousand spirits stray \n
That sweet joys betray. \n
Why should joys be sweet \n
Used with deceit, \n
Nor with sorrows meet? \n
But an honest joy \n
Does itself destroy \n
For a harlot coy. \n<|endoftext|>
night \n
Above us, stars. Beneath us, constellations. \n
Five billion miles away, a galaxy dies \n
like a snowflake falling on water. Below us, \n
some farmer, feeling the chill of that distant death, \n
snaps on his yard light, drawing his sheds and barn \n
back into the little system of his care. \n
All night, the cities, like shimmering novas, \n
tug with bright streets at lonely lights like his. \n<|endoftext|>

night \n
My window-pane is starred with frost, \n
The world is bitter cold to-night, \n
The moon is cruel, and the wind \n
Is like a two-edged sword to smite. \n
God pity all the homeless ones, \n
The beggars pacing to and fro. \n
God pity all the poor to-night \n
Who walk the lamp-lit streets of snow. \n
My room is like a bit of June, \n
Warm and close-curtained fold on fold, \n
But somewhere, like a homeless child, \n
My heart is crying in the cold. \n<|endoftext|>
night \n
Pigeons shake their wings on the copper church roof \n

night \n
No engines shrieking rescue storm the night, \n
And hose and hydrant cannot here avail; \n
The flames laugh high and fling their challenging light, \n
And clouds turn gray and black from silver-pale. \n
The fire leaps out and licks the ancient walls, \n
And the big building bends and twists and groans. \n
A bar drops from its place; a rafter falls \n
Burning the flowers. The wind in frenzy moans. \n
The watchers gaze, held wondering by the fire, \n
The dwellers cry their sorrow to the crowd, \n
The flames beyond themselves rise higher, higher, \n
To lose their glory in the frowning cloud, \n
Yielding at length the last reluctant breath. \n
And where life lay asleep broods darkly death. \n<|endoftext|>
night \n
The common rain had come again \n
Slanting and colorless, pale and anonymous, \n
Fainting falling in the first evening \n
Of the first perception of the actual fall, \n
The long and late light had slowly gathered up \n
A sooty wood of clouded sky, dim and distant more and \n
more \n
Until, at dusk, the very sense of selfhood waned, \n
A weakening nothing halted, diminished or denied or set \n
aside, \n
Neither tea, nor, after an hour, whiskey, \n
Ice and then a pleasant glow, a burning, \n
And the first leaping wood fire \n
Since a cold night in May, too long ago to be more than \n
Merely a cold and vivid memory. \n
Staring, empty, and without thought \n
Beyond the rising mists of the emotion of causeless \n
sadness, \n
How suddenly all consciousness leaped in spontaneous \n
gladness, \n
Knowing without thinking how the falling rain (outside, all \n
over) \n
In slow sustained consistent vibration all over outside \n
Tapping window, streaking roof, \n
running down runnel and drain \n
Waking a sense, once more, of all that lived outside of us, \n
Beyond emotion, for beyond the swollen \n
distorted shadows and lights \n
Of the toy town and the vanity fair \n
of waking consciousness! \n<|endoftext|>
night \n
SWIFTLY walk o'er the western wave, \n
Spirit of Night! \n
Out of the misty eastern cave,-- \n
Where, all the long and lone daylight, \n
Thou wovest dreams of joy and fear \n
Which make thee terrible and dear,-- \n
Swift be thy flight! \n
Wrap thy form in a mantle grey, \n
Star-inwrought! \n
Blind with thine hair the eyes of Day; \n
Kiss her until she be wearied out. \n
Then wander o'er city and sea and land, \n
Touching all with thine opiate wand-- \n
Come, long-sought! \n
When I arose and saw the dawn, \n
I sigh'd for thee; \n
When light rode high, and the dew was gone, \n
And noon lay heavy on flower and tree, \n
And the weary Day turn'd to his rest, \n
Lingering like an unloved guest, \n
I sigh'd for thee. \n
Thy brother Death came, and cried, \n
'Wouldst thou me?' \n
Thy sweet child Sleep, the filmy-eyed, \n
Murmur'd like a noontide bee, \n
'Shall I nestle near thy side? \n
Wouldst thou me?'--And I replied, \n
'No, not thee!' \n
Death will come when thou art dead, \n
Soon, too soon-- \n
Sleep will come when thou art fled. \n
Of neither would I ask the boon \n
I ask of thee, beloved Night-- \n
Swift be thine approaching flight, \n
Come soon, soon! \n<|endoftext|>
night \n
Athwart the bed \n
I watch the moonbeams cast a trail \n
So bright, so cold, so frail, \n
That for a space it gleams \n
Like hoar-frost on the margin of my dreams. \n
I raise my head, -- \n
The splendid moon I see: \n
Then droop my head, \n
And sink to dreams of thee -- \n
My Fatherland, of thee! \n<|endoftext|>
night \n
Longing for Death \n
Into the bosom of the earth, \n
Out of the Light's dominion, \n
Death's pains are but a bursting forth, \n
Sign of glad departure. \n
Swift in the narrow little boat, \n
Swift to the heavenly shore we float. \n
Blessed be the everlasting Night, \n
And blessed the endless slumber. \n
We are heated by the day too bright, \n
And withered up with care. \n
We're weary of a life abroad, \n
And we now want our Father's home. \n
What in this world should we all \n
Do with love and with faith? \n
That which is old is set aside, \n
And the new may perish also. \n
Alone he stands and sore downcast \n
Who loves with pious warmth the Past. \n
The Past where the light of the senses \n
In lofty flames did rise; \n
Where the Father's face and hand \n
All men did recognize; \n
And, with high sense, in simplicity \n
Many still fit the original pattern. \n
The Past wherein, still rich in bloom, \n
Man's strain did burgeon glorious, \n
And children, for the world to come, \n
Sought pain and death victorious, \n
And, through both life and pleasure spake, \n
Yet many a heart for love did break. \n
The Past, where to the flow of youth \n
God still showed himself, \n
And truly to an early death \n
Did commit his sweet life. \n
Fear and torture patiently he bore \n
So that he would be loved forever. \n
With anxious yearning now we see \n
That Past in darkness drenched, \n
With this world's water never we \n
Shall find our hot thirst quenched. \n
To our old home we have to go \n
That blessed time again to know. \n
What yet doth hinder our return \n
To loved ones long reposed? \n
Their grave limits our lives. \n
We are all sad and afraid. \n
We can search for nothing more -- \n
The heart is full, the world is void. \n
Infinite and mysterious, \n
Thrills through us a sweet trembling -- \n
As if from far there echoed thus \n
A sigh, our grief resembling. \n
Our loved ones yearn as well as we, \n
And sent to us this longing breeze. \n
Down to the sweet bride, and away \n
To the beloved Jesus. \n
Have courage, evening shades grow gray \n
To those who love and grieve. \n
A dream will dash our chains apart, \n
And lay us in the Father's lap. \n<|endoftext|>
night \n
In the wild soft summer darkness \n
How many and many a night we two together \n
Sat in the park and watched the Hudson \n
Wearing her lights like golden spangles \n
Glinting on black satin. \n
The rail along the curving pathway \n
Was low in a happy place to let us cross, \n
And down the hill a tree that dripped with bloom \n
Sheltered us, \n
While your kisses and the flowers, \n
Falling, falling, \n
Tangled in my hair. . . . \n
The frail white stars moved slowly over the sky. \n
And now, far off \n
In the fragrant darkness \n
The tree is tremulous again with bloom \n
For June comes back. \n
To-night what girl \n
Dreamily before her mirror shakes from her hair \n
This year's blossoms, clinging to its coils? \n<|endoftext|>
night \n
Chatter of birds two by two raises a night song joining a litany of running water--sheer waters \n
showing the russet of old stones remembering many rains. \n
And the long willows drowse on the shoulders of the running water, and sleep from much music; \n
joined songs of day-end, feathery throats and stony waters, in a choir chanting new psalms. \n
It is too much for the long willows when low laughter of a red moon comes down; and the willows \n
drowse and sleep on the shoulders of the running water. \n<|endoftext|>
night \n
At the mid hour of night, when stars are weeping, I fly \n
To the lone vale we loved, when life shone warm in thine eye; \n
And I think oft, if spirits can steal from the regions of air, \n
To revisit past scenes of delight, thou wilt come to me there, \n
And tell me our love is remember'd, even in the sky. \n
Then I sing the wild song 'twas once such pleasure to hear! \n
When our voices commingling breathed, like one, on the ear; \n
And, as Echo far off through the vale my said orison rolls, \n
I think, oh my love! 'tis thy voice from the Kingdom of Souls, \n
Faintly answering still the notes that once were so dear. \n<|endoftext|>
night \n
Night is my sister, and how deep in love, \n
How drowned in love and weedily washed ashore, \n
There to be fretted by the drag and shove \n
At the tide's edge, I lie—these things and more: \n
Whose arm alone between me and the sand, \n
Whose voice alone, whose pitiful breath brought near, \n
Could thaw these nostrils and unlock this hand, \n
She could advise you, should you care to hear. \n
Small chance, however, in a storm so black, \n
A man will leave his friendly fire and snug \n
For a drowned woman's sake, and bring her back \n
To drip and scatter shells upon the rug. \n
No one but Night, with tears on her dark face, \n
Watches beside me in this windy place. \n<|endoftext|>
night \n
Through my heart's palace Thoughts unnumbered throng; \n
And there, most quiet and, as a child, most wise, \n
High-throned you sit, and gracious. All day long \n
Great Hopes gold-armoured, jester Fantasies, \n
And pilgrim Dreams, and little beggar Sighs, \n
Bow to your benediction, go their way. \n
And the grave jewelled courtier Memories \n
Worship and love and tend you, all the day. \n
But when I sleep, and all my thoughts go straying, \n
When the high session of the day is ended, \n
And darkness comes; then, with the waning light, \n
By lilied maidens on your way attended, \n
Proud from the wonted throne, superbly swaying, \n
You, like a queen, pass out into the night. \n<|endoftext|>
night \n
For those that never know the light, \n
The darkness is a sullen thing; \n
And they, the Children of the Night, \n
Seem lost in Fortune's winnowing. \n
But some are strong and some are weak, -- \n
And there's the story. House and home \n
Are shut from countless hearts that seek \n
World-refuge that will never come. \n
And if there be no other life, \n
And if there be no other chance \n
To weigh their sorrow and their strife \n
Than in the scales of circumstance, \n
'T were better, ere the sun go down \n
Upon the first day we embark, \n
In life's imbittered sea to drown, \n
Than sail forever in the dark. \n
But if there be a soul on earth \n
So blinded with its own misuse \n
Of man's revealed, incessant worth, \n
Or worn with anguish, that it views \n
No light but for a mortal eye, \n
No rest but of a mortal sleep, \n
No God but in a prophet's lie, \n
No faith for "honest doubt" to keep; \n
If there be nothing, good or bad, \n
But chaos for a soul to trust, -- \n
God counts it for a soul gone mad, \n
And if God be God, He is just. \n
And if God be God, He is Love; \n
And though the Dawn be still so dim, \n
It shows us we have played enough \n
With creeds that make a fiend of Him. \n
There is one creed, and only one, \n
That glorifies God's excellence; \n
So cherish, that His will be done, \n
The common creed of common sense. \n
It is the crimson, not the gray, \n
That charms the twilight of all time; \n
It is the promise of the day \n
That makes the starry sky sublime; \n
It is the faith within the fear \n
That holds us to the life we curse; -- \n
So let us in ourselves revere \n
The Self which is the Universe! \n
Let us, the Children of the Night, \n
Put off the cloak that hides the scar! \n
Let us be Children of the Light, \n
And tell the ages what we are! \n<|endoftext|>

My husband loved me, pity the fool, \n
We met when I was young, \n
When I was eager to please, \n
And grateful for his love, \n
He meant the world to me, \n
But we both changed, \n
And my love turned to hate. \n
It meant to much at the start, \n
But he grew bored, \n
Of my ageing body, \n
Of my belly that wobbled, \n
And the wrinkles, \n
That came to dominate my face, \n
My once golden complexion, \n
Lost in the sands of time. \n
My husband's loyalty faded, \n
His heart grew cold, \n
As did mine, \n
I would cook dinner, \n
I would fix breakfast, \n
And please him as best I could, \n
All the while plotting revenge, \n
For those extra-marital affairs. \n
He made a mockery of me, \n
He humiliated me, \n
And lied to me, \n
But to the outsider, \n
I was none the wiser, \n
Playing the sad and sorry fool. \n
He deserved pain and death, \n
To know how it felt to be betrayed. \n
So I went online, \n
With the few computer skills I had, \n
And managed to trick my way, \n
To a vial of cyanide. \n
Tonight we will have the talk, \n
And I will pretend to forgive him, \n
Of my ageing body, \n
And a face lost without youth, \n
And when the authorities come, \n
They will not know the truth. \n
He will have had a heart attack in bed, \n
His head, \n
Lying on the pillow dead, \n
His heart knowing how it feels, \n
To be broken, \n
The son-of-a-b*tch dead, \n
Gone forever. \n
But the police are here now: \n
They have discovered what I did, \n
Even though I did fabricate a story, \n
I will now rot in a prison cell, \n
My husband's body cold in the ground, \n
And I shall reflect on the hate, \n
That destroyed a lifetime of marriage. \n<|endoftext|>

You commit murder when I look in your eyes \n
You tell me over and over you love me \n
why can’t we just live our lives \n
Murder commits suicide \n
Kill or be killed \n
No choice but to murder \n
Love is murder in the making \n
When you tell a person you love them \n
its murder in the 3rd degree \n
Rip me open from the inside \n
Until everything falls apart \n
The hurt just won't go away \n
Until it's everything I fear \n
You are everything I hate \n
Put me under your spell \n
Until I can't escape \n<|endoftext|>
murder \n
Pretty eyes wide \n
With a sweet innocent stare \n
Lips that whisper and pout \n
I had no idea \n
That he was such a dangerous man \n
I'm just a victim \n
A witness to a mad man's love \n
But is she really or.... \n
Did she get away with murder? \n
Angel or devil? \n
Who is the real Amber? \n
Hiding behind those tears \n
Does there lurk a killer's lie? \n
Was Scott the only one? \n
That Lacy could not trust \n
What about the blonde temptress? \n
Standing in the shadows \n
Did she get away with murder? \n
Sinner \n
Saint \n
What will time come to reveal? \n
Will we ever know? \n
Or do we listen only \n

The angel with the devil's eyes \n
Did she get away with murder? \n
For a fatal affair \n

murder \n
I'll tell you a crime story that you've never heard, \n
But first you'll have to promise to not spread the word. \n
It started many years ago on the Massachusetts coast. \n
Most of those who know of it are now themselves ghosts. \n
It is a murder story frightful and most ghastly. \n
If you mention it to the police they'll laugh, and YOU may be the victim, lastly. \n
After high school in the 60's I attended Boston College. \n
I went there for the social life, and to gain some more knowledge. \n
While there I joined a fraternity made up mostly of jocks. \n
Initiation week they made us attend classes with no shoes or sox. \n
I'm getting off the track a bit as does happen often. \n
I think too many drugs in the 60's caused my brain to soften. \n
A member of my fraternity was a B.C. basketball star; \n
He was scouted by the pros and it was felt he'd go far. \n
He was 6 foot 7 and his meals were supersized. \n
He was my closest friend and I enjoyed looking up at his eyes. \n
One night in the off season he went drinking at a bar. \n
He left the joint at 2 A.M. but he didn't get far. \n
He was found by a sanitation worker early the next morn. \n
His skull had been bashed in; his massive throat was well-torn. \n
It was a campus and Boston sensation, a sad one it was true. \n
I was crushed by his passing and from college I withdrew. \n
I had lots of money from my grandma; I did not need a job. \n
I moved to Miami and became a beach bum, not a slob. \n
Within three years two more murders were added to this story. \n
The descriptions of the bodies found were EXTREMELY gory. \n
One, a 6-4 white male prostitute, had been eviscerated. \n
The police photos of a black female socialite,6-3, were XXX-rated. \n
My parents lived in Santa Monica and insisted I move home. \n
I settled in their guest house but at times I still did roam. \n
I met and dated a wealthy,6-5, fashion model……… \n
The largest piece of her flesh found would fit inside a large bottle. \n
I started, then to see a shrink; I worried I'd go crazy. \n
I'm telling you my story's true, though at times details are hazy. \n
I spent ten years in analysis, which cost a lot of money, \n
But I believe it helped restore my faith and my outlook was more-sunny. \n
Then one summer I did Rio Mardi Gras; it was my BEST vacation yet. \n
But back home I learned my doctor had been found in his red Corvette. \n
What was left of him, I should say. I hesitate to here linger. \n
He'd been shot twelve times and was missing his left ring finger. \n
His skull and most of his ribs had been busted. \n
The once-shiny car had been burned, and his body was all-crusted. \n
By the way my doctor was 6 foot 4; could that be a clue? \n
I then checked into an upscale nuthouse for a month or two. \n
I was there on my own accord. My parents thought I was 'shopping'. \n
The docs did not believe my stories; my anxiety was not stopping. \n
So I moved back to the guest house. 'Mom and Dad, did you miss me? ' \n
Fat chance! They were busy with their lives, though once my mom did kiss me. \n
I found another psychiatrist, this one of short stature. \n
I met a pretty clerk at Starbucks and at the altar I did catch her. \n
The marriage lasted all of six months. No pregnancy, thank God. \n
I had it annulled, gave her twenty grand, but I still miss her bod. \n
My weekly doctor's visits went as well as I'd expected. \n
I tried a run for Santa Monica mayor but did not get elected. \n
Two more murders in my story just happened this year. \n
They were the murders of my parents for which I shed no tear. \n
It was an inconvenience, though, cleaning up the mess. \n
The police photographer threw up; ……hardened detectives cried no less. \n
I had to hire TWO murder cleanup crews. Their bills were a sin. \n
But still, afterward, I found pieces in the bushes, which made me grin. \n
There were other bodies I now realize I've forgotten to mention. \n
I can see from the look in your eyes I've gotten your attention. \n
All the victims were at least 6-3 (my mom WAS 6 foot 4, my dad was 6-7) . \n
Maybe all are gazing down now at us from a tall-people's heaven. \n
My doctor says I'm the murderer; she told me for a fee. \n
I'm really glad I met you; you're pretty as can be. \n
I'll bet you're as tall as me; I am 6 foot 3 inches tall. \n
It's getting dark and I love you. Let's drive to the mall. \n<|endoftext|>
murder \n
Once there lived two friends, \n
human and humanity. \n
human was loving and caring, \n
while humanity spread peace and brotherhood. \n
under their friendship tree, \n
everyone was happy and merry. \n
in the same world lived Hate and Greed, full of sinister. \n
very different from all the other. \n
who were always jealous of human and humanity, \n
and they tried hard to part the friends \n
and throw them away in different ends. \n
the did succeed, \n
in the heart of human they planted hate-seed. \n
soon the seed started to rear, \n
and human was left with no love and care. \n
it turned furious towards humanity. \n
all their friendship woes turned into enmity. \n
hate and greed infected human one after the other. \n
and made human to commit the murder. \n
end of peace was marked with the murder of humanity, \n
in some lost corner is the grave of humanity, \n
now the world knows only hate, greed and enmity. \n<|endoftext|>

Murder the great sin \n
That commits only by humans \n
For petty reasons, and quarrels \n
Murder highly deplorable always. \n
Murder a horrendous crime \n
The tough criminals indulge \n
Where law of the land trials \n
And punish the guilty, law insists. \n
Designed murders on vengeance \n
Extremely cruel always \n
Where man changes himself as beast \n
And takes weapons against enemy \n
Commit the crime without pity \n
Humanity fails its nobleness. \n
Let us desire for a peaceful society \n
where murders are not an incident \n
An event to mourn and lose to family \n
We are supposed to live in unison. \n<|endoftext|>
murder \n
When the Lieutenant of the Guardia de Asalto \n
heard the automatic go off, he turned \n
and took the second shot just above \n
the sternum, the third tore away \n
the right shoulder of his uniform, \n
the fourth perforated his cheek. As he \n
slid out of his comrade's hold \n
toward the gray cement of the Ramblas \n
he lost count and knew only \n
that he would not die and that the blue sky \n
smudged with clouds was not heaven \n
for heaven was nowhere and in his eyes \n
slowly filling with their own light. \n
The pigeons that spotted the cold floor \n
of Barcelona rose as he sank below \n
the waves of silence crashing \n
on the far shores of his legs, growing \n
faint and watery. His hands opened \n
a last time to receive the benedictions \n
of automobile exhaust and rain \n
and the rain of soot. His mouth, \n
that would never again say 'I am afraid,' \n
closed on nothing. The old grandfather \n
hawking daisies at his stand pressed \n
a handkerchief against his lips \n
and turned his eyes away before they held \n
the eyes of a gunman. The shepherd dogs \n
on sale howled in their cages \n
and turned in circles. There is more \n
to be said, but by someone who has suffered \n
and died for his sister the earth \n
and his brothers the beasts and the trees. \n
The Lieutenant can hear it, the prayer \n
that comes on the voices of water, today \n
or yesterday, form Chicago or Valladolid, \n
and hands like smoke above this street \n
he won't walk as a man ever again. \n<|endoftext|>

Upon the threshold, red-eyed Murder stands, \n
Fresh from his slaughter-house of human meat, \n
Blood on his broken teeth and on his hands, \n
Blood on his nails and on his purple feet. \n
With hollow voice he speaks, and sick'ning breath, \n
'A way there is, that only way is death!…. \n
The dead will rise no more,-the dead are dead! \n
The spared will creep behind the sparer's back, \n
And breathe their plots and stab. The dead are dead! \n
And lie along the safe triumphal track. \n
The young-eyed babe, will lisp it's little tales. \n
The loving girl will slay her main in bed \n
Kissing his savage mouth, the victor fails \n
At Mercy's seat. The dead are safely dead'. \n<|endoftext|>
murder \n
Brought up in a prejudice dysfunctional household. \n
Took away the heart that once lived within your soul \n
Fiery eyes of a demon, a prejudice beast \n
Live your heart, conjuring up a deploring feast \n
You’ve hurt, you’ve maimed, took education away. \n
Took bright eyes and turned them a shade of gray. \n
Many years took its toile on the likes of you. \n
Bad heart, failed kidneys, time to pay your dues. \n
You reside in a room on the other side of town. \n
No one visits, no one cares, you sit wearing a frown. \n
Time to think and reflect while your body breaks down \n
No legacy to leave, you failed all around \n
The same people you despised, harbored hate for years \n
are the people who now console, dry your tears. \n
Why waste your time in this blessed life, \n
to create heartache, hate and contribute to ones strife. \n
Remember what you give out, you get back ten times more. \n
Father time will surely visit, come walking through your door. \n
Pick yourself up, start now before it’s too late. \n
Stop the cruelty, the pain, the destruction of hate. \n

I find no peace, and all my war is done. \n
I fear and hope. I burn and freeze like ice. \n
I fly above the wind, yet can I not arise; \n
And nought I have, and all the world I season. \n
That loseth nor locketh holdeth me in prison \n
And holdeth me not--yet can I scape no wise-- \n
Nor letteth me live nor die at my device, \n
And yet of death it giveth me occasion. \n
Without eyen I see, and without tongue I plain. \n
I desire to perish, and yet I ask health. \n
I love another, and thus I hate myself. \n
I feed me in sorrow and laugh in all my pain; \n
Likewise displeaseth me both life and death, \n
And my delight is causer of this strife. \n<|endoftext|>

Where the mountains touch the sky, \n
Where poets DREAM, where eagles fly, \n
A secret place above the crowd, \n
Just beneath a silver-lined cloud. \n
Lift your eyes to a snowy peak, \n
And see the soon-to-be we seek. \n
Whisper DREAMS and let them rise, \n
To the mountains old and wise. \n
Climbers climb, it's time to try, \n
Where the mountains touch the sky. \n
Take me there. Oh take me now, \n
Someway, Someday, Somewhere, Somehow. \n
Where the ocean meets the sky, \n
Where mermaid dance, where seagulls fly, \n
A place in DREAMS I know so well, \n
The sea inside a single shell. \n
Far across the living sea, \n
A pale blue possibility, \n
Beyond the castles made of sand, \n
Tomorrow in a small child's hand. \n
Only DREAMERS need apply, \n
Where the ocean meets the sky. \n
Take me there. Oh take me now, \n
Someway, Someday, Somewhere, Somehow. \n
A common ground for one and all, \n
Behind the crystal waterfall, \n
Where Peace flows like a mighty stream, \n
Like Dr. King I have a DREAM. \n
Imagine such a goal in sight, \n
For red and yellow, black and white… \n
New Delhi, Beijing, Kenya, Rome, \n
Earth is the place that we call home. \n
Baghdad, Belfast, Tel Aviv, \n
One race HUMAN, we still believe, \n
Come DREAM with me... \n
Where the forests reach the sky, \n
Wake to DREAMS, and don’t be shy. \n
We’ll DREAM the world a thorn-less rose; \n
We’ll plant then watch it as it grows. \n
We’ll conquer hate with DREAMS of hope, \n
We’ll DREAM one big kaleidoscope. \n
Whisper now; let the DREAM begin, \n
It's time to trust the truth within. \n
This is where we seek and find… \n
A place called PEACE for humankind. \n
DREAM on DREAMERS, hopes are high, \n
Where the forests reach the sky. \n
Take me there. Oh take me now, \n
Someway, Someday, Somewhere, Somehow. \n
Now, listen close, the future calls... \n
'Build your bridges and tear down walls! ' \n
For time has taught and so it seems, \n
Realities are born of DREAMS! \n

peace \n
Peace is letting life's cares \n
Roll over your head while \n
Stamping on them with both feet. \n
It is daily maintaining control \n
Of the body, mind and soul. \n
Peace is steering away from snares \n
And not taking on life's gloomy cares. \n
It is being like falling snowflakes \n
Wonderfully resting serenely as you \n
Lie on your bed when sick or well. \n
Peace is letting God have complete control \n
Of troubles, misery and gloom. \n
Peace never entertains sorrow \n
But firmly grips hope for each tomorrow. \n
Sometimes, peace says speak. \n
Frequently, peace says be silent. \n
Peace dwells deep within you and me \n
Where no mortal being can reach. \n
Peace cries, "Never let me go \n
For I am yours to forever keep." \n<|endoftext|>

(Judges, vi.25) \n
Jesus! whose blood so freely stream'd \n
To satisfy the law's demand; \n
By Thee from guilt and wrath redeem'd, \n
Before the Father's face I stand. \n
To reconcile offending man, \n
Make Justice drop her angry rod; \n
What creature could have form'd the plan, \n
Or who fulfil it but a God? \n
No drop remains of all the curse, \n
For wretches who deserved the whole; \n
No arrows dipt in wrath to pierce \n
The guilty, but returning soul. \n
Peace by such means so dearly bought, \n
What rebel could have hoped to see? \n
Peace by his injured Sovereign wrought, \n
His Sovereign fasten'd to a tree. \n
Now, Lord, Thy feeble worm prepare! \n
For strife with earth and hell begins; \n
Conform and gird me for the war; \n
They hate the soul that hates his sins. \n

Now, God be thanked Who has matched us with His hour, \n
And caught our youth, and wakened us from sleeping, \n
With hand made sure, clear eye, and sharpened power, \n
To turn, as swimmers into cleanness leaping, \n
Glad from a world grown old and cold and weary, \n
Leave the sick hearts that honour could not move, \n
And half-men, and their dirty songs and dreary, \n
And all the little emptiness of love! \n
Oh! we, who have known shame, we have found release there, \n
Where there's no ill, no grief, but sleep has mending, \n
Naught broken save this body, lost but breath; \n
Nothing to shake the laughing heart's long peace there \n
But only agony, and that has ending; \n
And the worst friend and enemy is but Death. \n<|endoftext|>
peace \n
The tempest calmed after bending the branches of the trees and leaning heavily upon the grain in the field. The stars appeared as broken remnants of lightning, but now silence prevailed over all, as if Nature's war had never been fought. \n
At that hour a young woman entered her chamber and knelt by her bed sobbing bitterly. Her heart flamed with agony but she could finally open her lips and say, "Oh Lord, bring him home safely to me. I have exhausted my tears and can offer no more, oh Lord, full of love and mercy. My patience is drained and calamity is seeking possession of my heart. Save him, oh Lord, from the iron paws of War; deliver him from such unmerciful Death, for he is weak, governed by the strong. Oh Lord, save my beloved, who is Thine own son, from the foe, who is Thy foe. Keep him from the forced pathway to Death's door; let him see me, or come and take me to him." \n
Quietly a young man entered. His head was wrapped in bandage soaked with escaping life. \n
He approached he with a greeting of tears and laughter, then took her hand and placed against it his flaming lips. And with a voice with bespoke past sorrow, and joy of union, and uncertainty of her reaction, he said, "Fear me not, for I am the object of your plea. Be glad, for Peace has carried me back safely to you, and humanity has restored what greed essayed to take from us. Be not sad, but smile, my beloved. Do not express bewilderment, for Love has power that dispels Death; charm that conquers the enemy. I am your one. Think me not a specter emerging from the House of Death to visit your Home of Beauty. \n
"Do not be frightened, for I am now Truth, spared from swords and fire to reveal to the people the triumph of Love over War. I am Word uttering introduction to the play of happiness and peace." \n
Then the young man became speechless and his tears spoke the language of the heart; and the angels of Joy hovered about that dwelling, and the two hearts restored the singleness which had been taken from them. \n
At dawn the two stood in the middle of the field contemplating the beauty of Nature injured by the tempest. After a deep and comforting silence, the soldier said to his sweetheart, "Look at the Darkness, giving birth to the Sun." \n<|endoftext|>
peace \n
How clear is the air found at a mountain's top, \n
And breathing this freshness, clarifies all things, \n
At such high altitude, oxygen can drop, \n
Then movement slow's, but thoughts fly swift on wings, \n
Letting the new adventurer explore, \n
A world that opens wide its magic doors. \n
Land of peak and valley, sea and shore. \n
Viewing all this, one's heart pulsates and soars, \n
Then a sense of peace, envelops the inner soul, \n
And lightness pervades, where heaviness has been, \n
Lifting the senses, raising them as a whole, \n
Introducing pure quietness, making one's life serene. \n

How far is it to peace, the piper sighed, \n
The solitary, sweating as he paused. \n
Asphalt the noon; the ravens, terrified, \n
Fled carrion thunder that percussion caused. \n
The envelope of earth was powder loud; \n
The taut wings shivered, driven at the sun. \n
The piper put his pipe away and bowed. \n
Not here, he said. I hunt the love-cool one, \n
The dancer with the clipped hair. Where is she? \n
We shook our heads, parting for him to pass. \n
Our lady was of no such trim degree, \n
And none of us had seen her face, alas. \n
She was the very ridges that we must scale, \n
Securing the rough top. And how she smiled \n
Was how our strength would issue. Not to fail \n
Was having her, gigantic, undefiled, \n
For homely goddess, big as the world that burned, \n
Grandmother and taskmistress, frild and town. \n
We let the stranger go; but when we turned \n
Our lady lived, fierce in each other's frown. \n<|endoftext|>

This is an angry poem. \n
About those weasel phrases \n

deceive ourselves. \n
'The pee-yus pro-sayus' - \n

and believe that it needs hard work \n
and forward planning \n
and careful progress \n
and compromise \n
and agreements \n
and initiatives \n
and 'generous' concessions \n
and declarations of intention \n
and cautious examination \n
of opponents' motives \n
in the 'battle' for peace \n
and coming together \n
to establish differences... \n
Peace \n
is what is eternally there \n
when war and strife is absent. \n
Eternally. \n
I can't remember Christ \n
(was he Catholic or Protestant? I just can't remember...) \n
saying \n
'Peace process be unto you'... \n
uh, when would that be? ... \n
or commanding the waves of the Sea of Galilee \n
'Engage in the peace process - be still'... \n
somehow it just doesn't seem to carry weight \n
as a blessing or a do-it-now... \n
'Go in process towards peace, my child...' \n
I wonder why that is. \n<|endoftext|>

After Stuart Merrill \n
Trembling of purple banners in the fight, \n
Wild neigh of horses in destruction's path, \n
Howling of trumpets answering yells of wrath, \n
Dim eyes where slowly fades the living light; \n
And on the plains, the ghastly heaped up death \n
O'er which the guns thunder their dull refrain; \n
And summer is shamed and autumn grieves in rain, \n
And carnage breathes abroad a hateful breath. \n
Back! O thou nightmare of the tired world's rest! \n
The Spring sees blooming at the mother's breast \n
Pink mouths of babes with cooing laughter rife; \n
While from the valley to the mountain springs, \n

Sound, like young heart-beats, all the bells of Life. \n<|endoftext|>

And blush that I should ever be \n
Thus prone to act so base a part, \n
Or harbour one hard thought of Thee! \n
Oh! let me then at length be taught \n
What I am still so slow to learn, \n
That God is love, and changes not, \n
Nor knows the shadow of a turn. \n
Sweet truth, and easy to repeat! \n
But when my faith is sharply tried, \n
I find myself a learner yet, \n
Unskilful, weak, and apt to slide. \n
But, O my Lord, one look from Thee \n
Subdues the disobedient will, \n
Drives doubt and discontent away, \n
And Thy rebellious worm is still. \n
Thou art as ready to forgive \n
As I am ready to repine; \n
Thou, therefore, all the praise receive; \n
Be shame and self-abhorrence mine. \n<|endoftext|>

"This war is a terrible thing," he said, \n
"With its countless numbers of needless dead; \n
A futile warfare it seems to me, \n
Fought for no principle I can see. \n
Alas, that thousands of hearts should bleed \n
For naught but a tyrant's boundless greed!" \n
Said the wholesale grocer, in righteous mood, \n
As he went to adulterate salable food. \n
Spake as follows the merchant king: \n
"Isn't this war a disgusting thing? \n
Heartless, cruel, and useless, too; \n
It doesn't seem that it can be true. \n
Think of the misery, want and fear! \n
We ought to be grateful we've no war here. \n
"Six a week"--to a girl--"That's flat! \n
I can get a thousand to work for that." \n<|endoftext|>
peace \n
Sometimes a light surprises \n
The Christian while he sings; \n
It is the Lord who rises \n
With healing in his wings: \n
When comforts are declining, \n
He grants the soul again \n
A season of clear shining, \n
To cheer it after rain. \n
In holy contemplation, \n
We sweetly then pursue \n
The theme of God's salvation, \n
And find it ever new: \n
Set free from present sorrow, \n
We cheerfully can say, \n
E'en let th' unknown to-morrow \n
Bring with it what it may. \n
It can bring with it nothing \n
But he will bear us through; \n
Who gives the lilies clothing, \n
Will clothe his people too: \n
Beneath the spreading heavens, \n
No creature but is fed; \n
And he who feeds the ravens, \n
Will give his children bread. \n
Though vine nor fig-tree neither \n
Their wonted fruit shall bear, \n
Though all the field should wither, \n
Nor flocks nor herds be there: \n
Yet God the same abiding, \n
His praise shall tune my voice; \n
For while in him confiding, \n
I cannot but rejoice. \n<|endoftext|>

(Isaiah, ix. 15-20) \n
Hear what God the Lord hath spoken, \n
"O my people, faint and few, \n
Comfortless, afflicted, broken, \n
Fair abodes I build for you. \n
Thorns of heartfelt tribulation \n
Shall no more perplex your ways; \n
You shall name your walls, Salvation, \n
And your gates shall all be Praise. \n
"There, like streams that feed the garden, \n
Pleasures without end shall flow, \n
For the Lord, your faith rewarding, \n
All His bounty shall bestow; \n
Still in undisturb'd possession \n
Peace and righteousness shall reign; \n
Never shall you feel oppression, \n
Hear the voice of war again. \n
"Ye no more your suns descending, \n
Waning moons no more shall see; \n
But your griefs forever ending, \n
Find eternal noon in me: \n
God shall rise, and shining o'er ye, \n
Change to day the gloom of night; \n
He, the Lord, shall be your glory, \n
God your everlasting light." \n<|endoftext|>

AH, that Time could touch a form \n
That could show what Homer's age \n
Bred to be a hero's wage. \n
'Were not all her life but storm \n
Would not painters paint a form \n
Of such noble lines,' I said, \n
'Such a delicate high head, \n
All that sternness amid charm, \n
All that sweetness amid strength?' \n

______ Sacerdos \n
Fronde super mitram, & felici comptus oliva. \n
Virg. \n
To the Lord Privy Seal \n
Contending kings, and fields of death, too long \n
Have been the subject of the British song. \n
Who hath not read of fam'd Ramillia's plain, \n
Bavaria's fall, and Danube choak'd with slain! \n
Exhausted themes! a gentler note I raise, \n
And sing returning peace in softer lays. \n
Their fury quell'd, and martial rage allay'd, \n
I wait our heroes in the sylvan shade: \n
Disbanding hosts are imag'd to my mind, \n
And warring powers in friendly leagues combin'd, \n
While ease and pleasure make the nations smile, \n
And Heaven and Anna bless Britannia's isle. \n
Well sends our queen her mitred Bristol forth, \n
For early counsels fam'd, and long-try'd worth; \n
Who, thirty rolling years, had oft withheld \n
The Swede and Saxon from the dusty field; \n
Completely form'd to heal the Christian wounds, \n
To name the kings, and give each kingdom bounds; \n
The face of ravag'd Nature to repair, \n
By leagues to soften Earth, and Heaven by prayer, \n
To gain by love, where rage and slaughter fail, \n
And make the crosier o'er the sword prevail. \n
So when great Moses, with Jehovah's wand, \n
Had scatter'd plagues o'er stubborn Pharaoh's land, \n
Now spread an host of locusts round the shore, \n
Now turn'd Nile's fattening streams to putrid gore; \n
Plenty and gladness mark'd the priest of God, \n
And sudden almonds shot from Aaron's rod. \n
O thou, from whom these bounteous blessings flow, \n
To whom, as chief, the hopes of peace we owe, \n
(For next to thee, the man whom kings contend \n
To style companion, and to make their friend, \n
Great Strafford, rich in every courtly grace, \n
With joyful pride accepts the second place) \n
From Britain's isle, and Isis' sacred spring, \n
One hour, oh! listen while the Muses sing. \n
Though ministers of mighty monarchs wait, \n
With beating hearts to learn their masters' fate, \n
One hour forbear to speak thy queen's commands, \n
Nor think the world, thy charge, neglected stands; \n
The blissful prospects, in my verse display'd \n
May lure the stubborn, the deceiv'd persuade: \n
Ev'n thou to peace shalt speedier urge the way, \n
And more be hasten'd by this short delay. \n
On the Prospect of Peace \n
The haughty Gaul, in ten campaigns o'erthrown, \n
Now ceas'd to think the western world his own. \n
Oft had he mourn'd his boasting leaders bound, \n
And his proud bulwarks smoking on the ground: \n
In vain with powers renew'd he fill'd the plain, \n
Made timorous vows, and brib'd the saints in vain; \n
As oft his legions did the fight decline, \n
Lurk'd in the trench, and skulk'd behind the line. \n
Before his eyes the fancied javelin gleams, \n
At feasts he starts, and seems dethron'd in dreams; \n
On glory past reflects with secret pain, \n
On mines exhausted, and on millions slain. \n
To Britain's queen the scepter'd suppliant bends, \n
To her his crowns and infant race commends, \n
Who grieves her fame with Christian blood to buy, \n
Nor asks for glory at a price so high. \n
At her decree, the war suspended stands, \n
And Britain's heroes hold their lifted hands, \n
Their open brows no threatening frowns disguise, \n
But gentler passions sparkle in their eyes. \n
The Gauls, who never in their courts could find \n
Such temper'd fire with manly beauty join'd, \n
Doubt if they 're those, whom, dreadful to the view, \n
In forms so fierce their fearful fancies drew; \n
At whose dire names ten thousand widows prest \n
Their helpless orphans clinging to the breast. \n
In silent rapture each his foe surveys; \n
They vow firm friendship, and give mutual praise. \n
Brave minds, howe'er at war, are secret friends; \n
Their generous discord with the battle ends; \n
In peace they wonder whence dissension rose, \n
And ask how souls so like could e'er be foes. \n
Methinks I hear more friendly shouts rebound, \n
And social clarions mix their sprightly sound. \n
The British flags are furl'd, her troops disband, \n
And scatter'd armies seek their native land. \n
The hardy veteran, proud of many a scar, \n
The manly charms and honours of the war, \n
Who hop'd to share his friends' illustrious doom, \n
And in the battle find a soldier's tomb, \n
Leans on his spear to take his farewell view, \n
And, sighing, bids the glorious camp adieu. \n
Ye generous fair, receive the brave with smiles, \n
O'erpay their sleepless nights, and crown their toils; \n
Soft beauty is the gallant soldier's due, \n
For you they conquer, and they bleed for you. \n
In vain proud Gaul with boastful Spain conspires, \n
When English valour English beauty fires; \n
The nations dread your eyes, and kings despair \n
Of chiefs so brave, till they have nymphs so fair. \n
See the fond wife in tears of transport drown'd, \n
Hugs her rough lord, and weeps o'er every wound, \n
Hangs on the lips that fields of blood relate, \n
And smiles, or trembles, at his various fate. \n
Near the full bowl he draws the fancy'd line, \n
And marks feign'd trenches in the flowing wine, \n
Then sets th' invested fort before his eyes, \n
And mines, that whirl'd battalions to the skies: \n
His little listening progeny turn pale, \n
And beg again to hear the dreadful tale. \n
Such dire achievements sings the bard, that tells \n
Of palfrey'd dames, bold knights, and magic spells, \n
Where whole brigades one champion's arms o'erthrow, \n
And cleave a giant at a random blow, \n
Slay paynims vile, that force the fair, and tame \n
The goblin's fury, and the dragon's flame. \n
Our eager youth to distant nations run, \n
To visit fields, their valiant fathers won; \n
From Flandria's shore their country's fame they trace, \n
Till far Germania shows her blasted face. \n
Th' exulting Briton asks his mournful guide, \n
Where his hard fate the lost Bavaria try'd: \n
Where Stepney grav'd the stone to Anna's fame, \n
He points to Blenheim, once a vulgar name; \n
Here fled the Household, there did Tallard yield, \n
Here Marlborough turn'd the fortune of the field, \n
On those steep banks, near Danube's raging flood: \n
The Gauls thrice started back, and trembling stood: \n
When, Churchill's arm perceiv'd, they stood not long, \n
But plung'd amidst the waves, a desperate throng, \n
Crowds whelm'd on crowds dash'd wide the watery-bed, \n
And drove the current to its distant head. \n
As, when by Raphael's, or by Kneller's hands \n
A warlike courser on the canvas stands, \n
Such as on Landen bleeding Ormond bore, \n
Or set young Ammon on the Granic shore; \n
If chance a generous steed the work behold, \n
He snorts, he neighs, he champs the foamy gold: \n
So, Hocstet seen, tumultuous passions roll, \n
And hints of glory fire the Briton's soul, \n
In fancy'd fights he sees the troops engage, \n
And all the tempest of the battle rage. \n
Charm me, ye powers, with scenes less nobly bright, \n
Far humbler thoughts th' inglorious Muse delight, \n
Content to see the honours of the field \n
By plough-shares levell'd, or in flowers conceal'd. \n
O'er shatter'd walls may creeping ivy twine, \n
And grass luxuriant clothe the harmless mine. \n
Tame flocks ascend the breach without a wound, \n
Or crop the bastion, now a fruitful ground; \n
While shepherds sleep, along the rampard laid, \n
Or pipe beneath the formidable shade. \n
Who was the man? Oblivion blast his name, \n
Torn out, and blotted from the list of Fame! \n
Who, fond of lawless rule, and proudly brave, \n
First sunk the filial subject to a slave, \n
His neighbour's realms by frauds unkingly gain'd, \n
In guiltless blood the sacred ermine stain'd, \n
Laid schemes for death, to slaughter turn'd his heart, \n
And fitted murder to the rules of art. \n
Ah! curst Ambition, to thy lures we owe \n
All the great ills, that mortals bear below. \n
Curst by the hind, when to the spoil he yields \n
His year's whole sweat, and vainly ripen'd fields; \n
Curst by the maid, torn from her lover's side, \n
When left a widow, though not yet a bride; \n
By mothers curst, when floods of tears they shed, \n
And scatter useless roses on the dead. \n
Oh, sacred Bristol! then, what dangers prove \n
The arts, thou smil'st on with paternal love? \n
Then, mixt with rubbish by the brutal foes, \n
In vain the marble breathes, the canvas glows; \n
To shades obscure the glittering sword pursues \n
The gentle poet, and defenceless Muse. \n
A voice like thine, alone, might then asswage \n
The warrior's fury, and control his rage; \n
To hear thee speak, might the fierce Vandal stand, \n
And fling the brandish'd sabre from his hand. \n
Far hence be driven to Scythia's stormy shore \n
The drum's harsh music, and the cannon's roar; \n
Let grim Bellona haunt the lawless plain, \n
Where Tartar clans and grizly Cossacks reign; \n
Let the steel'd Turk be deaf to matrons' cries, \n
See virgins ravish'd with relentless eyes, \n
To death grey heads and smiling infants doom, \n
Nor spare the promise of the pregnant womb, \n
O'er wasted kingdoms spread his wide command, \n
The savage lord of an unpeopled land. \n
Her guiltless glory just Britannia draws \n
From pure religion, and impartial laws, \n
To Europe's wounds a mother's aid she brings, \n
And holds in equal scales the rival kings: \n
Her generous sons in choicest gifts abound, \n
Alike in arms, alike in arts renown'd. \n
As when sweet Venus (so the fable sings) \n
Awak'd by Nereids, from the ocean springs, \n
With smiles she sees the threatening billows rise, \n
Spreads smooth the surge, and clears the louring skies. \n
Light, o'er the deep, with fluttering Cupids crown'd, \n
The pearly couch and silver turtles bound; \n
Her tresses shed ambrosial odours round. \n
Amidst the world of waves so stands serene \n
Britannia's isle, the ocean's stately queen; \n
In vain the nations have conspired her fall, \n
Her trench the sea, and fleets her floating wall: \n
Defenceless barks, her powerful navy near, \n
Have only waves and hurricanes to fear. \n
What bold invader, or what land opprest, \n
Hath not her anger quell'd, her aid redrest! \n
Say, where have e'er her union-crosses sail'd, \n
But much her arms, her justice more prevail'd! \n
Her labours are, to plead th' Almighty's cause, \n
Her pride to teach th' untam'd barbarian laws: \n
Who conquers wins by brutal strength the prize; \n
But 'tis a godlike work to civilize. \n
Have we forgot how from great Russia's throne \n
The king, whose power half Europe's regions own, \n
Whose sceptre waving, with one shout rush forth \n
In swarms the harness'd millions of the north, \n
Through realms of ice pursued his tedious way \n
To court our friendship, and our fame survey! \n
Hence the rich prize of useful arts he bore, \n
And round his empire spread the learned store: \n
(T' adorn old realms is more than new to raise, \n
His country's parent is a monarch's praise.) \n
His bands now march in just array to war, \n
And Caspian gulphs unusual navies bear; \n
With Runick lays Smolensko's forests ring, \n
And wondering Volga hears the Muses sing. \n
Did not the painted kings of India greet \n
Our queen, and lay their sceptres at her feet? \n
Chiefs who full bowls of hostile blood had quaff'd, \n
Fam'd for the javelin, and envenom'd shaft, \n
Whose haughty brows made savages adore, \n
Nor bow'd to less than stars or sun before. \n
Her pitying smile accepts their suppliant claim, \n
And adds four monarchs to the Christian name. \n
Blest use of power! O virtuous pride in kings! \n
And like his bounty, whence dominion springs! \n
Which o'er new worlds makes Heaven's indulgence shine, \n
And ranges myriads under laws divine! \n
Well bought with all that those sweet regions hold, \n
With groves of spices, and with mines of gold. \n
Fearless our merchant now pursues his gain, \n
And roams securely o'er the boundless main. \n
Now o'er his head the polar Bear he spies, \n
And freezing spangles of the Lapland skies; \n
Now swells his canvas to the sultry line, \n
With glittering spoils where Indian grottos shine, \n
Where fumes of incense glad the southern seas, \n
And wafted citron scents the balmy breeze. \n
Here nearer suns prepare the ripening gem, \n
To grace great Anne's imperial diadem, \n
And here the ore, whose melted mass shall yield \n
On faithful coins each memorable field, \n
Which, mix'd with medals of immortal Rome, \n
May clear disputes, and teach the times to come. \n
In circling beams shall godlike Anna glow, \n
And Churchill's sword hang o'er the prostrate foe; \n
In comely wounds shall bleeding worthies stand, \n
Webb's firm platoon, and Lumley's faithful band. \n
Bold Mordaunt in Iberian trophies drest, \n
And Campbell's dragon on his dauntless breast, \n
Great Ormond's deeds on Vigo's spoils enroll'd, \n
And Guiscard's knife on Harley's Chili gold. \n
And if the Muse, O Bristol, might decree, \n
Here Granville noted by the lyre should be, \n
The lyre for Granville, and the cross for thee. \n
Such are the honours grateful Britain pays; \n
So patriots merit, and so monarchs praise. \n
O'er distant times such records shall prevail, \n
When English numbers, antiquated, fail: \n
A trifling song the Muse can only yield, \n
And sooth her soldiers panting from the field. \n
To sweet retirements see them safe convey'd, \n
And raise their battles in the rural shade. \n
From fields of death to Woodstock's peaceful glooms, \n
(The poet's haunt) Britannia's hero comes -- \n
Begin my Muse, and softly touch the string: \n
Here Henry lov'd; and Chaucer learn'd to sing. \n
Hail, fabled grotto! hail, Elysian soil! \n
Thou fairest spot of fair Britannia's isle! \n
Where kings of old, conceal'd, forgot the throne, \n
And Beauty was content to shine unknown; \n
Where Love and War by turns pavilions rear, \n
And Henry's bowers near Blenheim's dome appear; \n
The weary'd champion lull in soft alcoves, \n
The noblest boast of thy romantic groves. \n
Oft, if the Muse presage, shall he be seen \n
By Rosamonda fleeting o'er the green, \n
In dreams be hail'd by heroes' mighty shades, \n
And hear old Chaucer warble through the glades, \n
O'er the fam'd echoing vaults his name shall bound, \n
And hill to hill reflect the favourite sound. \n
Here, here at least thy love for arms give o'er, \n
Nor, one world conquer'd, fondly wish for more. \n
Vice of great souls alone! O thirst of fame! \n
The Muse admires it, while she strives to blame. \n
Thy toils be now to chase the bounding deer, \n
Or view the coursers stretch in wild career. \n
This lovely scene shall sooth thy soul to rest, \n
And wear each dreadful image from thy breast. \n
With pleasure, by thy conquests shalt thou see \n
Thy queen triumphant, and all Europe free. \n
No cares henceforth shall thy repose destroy, \n
But what thou giv'st the world, thyself enjoy. \n
Sweet Solitude! when life's gay hours are past \n
Howe'er we range, in thee we fix at last: \n
Tost through tempestuous seas (the voyage o'er) \n
Pale we look back, and bless thy friendly shore. \n
Our own strict judges our past life we scan, \n
And ask if glory hath enlarg'd the span: \n
If bright the prospect, we the grave defy, \n
Trust future ages, and contented die. \n
When strangers from far distant climes shall come, \n
To view the pomp of this triumphant dome, \n
Where, rear'd aloft, dissembled trophies stand, \n
And breathing labours of the sculptor's hand, \n
Where Kneller's art shall paint the flying Gaul, \n
And Bourbon's woes shall fill the story'd wall; \n
Heirs of thy blood shall o'er their bounteous board \n
Fix Europe's guard, thy monumental sword, \n
Banners that oft have wav'd on conquer'd walls, \n
And trumps, that drown'd the groans of gasping Gauls. \n
Fair dames shall oft, with curious eye, explore \n
The costly robes that slaughter'd generals wore, \n
Rich trappings from the Danube's whirlpools brought, \n
(Hesperian nuns the gorgeous broidery wrought) \n
Belts stiff with gold, the Boian horseman's pride, \n
And Gaul's fair flowers, in human crimson dy'd. \n
Of Churchill's race perhaps some lovely boy \n
Shall mark the burnish'd steel that hangs on high, \n
Shall gaze transported on its glittering charms, \n
And reach it struggling with unequal arms, \n
By signs the drum's tumultuous sound request, \n
Then seek, in starts, the hushing mother's breast. \n
So in the painter's animated frame, \n
Where Mars embraces the soft Paphian dame, \n
The little Loves in sport his fauchion wield, \n
Or join their strength to heave his ponderous shield: \n
One strokes the plume in Tytion's gore embrued, \n
And one the spear, that reeks with Typhon's blood: \n
Another's infant brows the helm sustain, \n
He nods his crest, and frights the shrieking train. \n
Thus, the rude tempest of the field o'erblown, \n
Shall whiter rounds of smiling years roll on, \n
Our victors, blest in peace, forget their wars, \n
Enjoy past dangers, and absolve the stars. \n
But, oh! what sorrows shall bedew your urns, \n
Ye honour'd shades, whom widow'd Albion mourns! \n
If your thin forms yet discontented moan, \n
And haunt the mangled mansions, once your own; \n
Behold what flowers the pious Muses strow, \n
And tears, which in the midst of triumph flow; \n
Cypress and bays your envy'd brows surround, \n
Your names the tender matron's heart shall wound, \n
And the soft maid grow pensive at the sound. \n
Accept, great Anne, the tears their memory draws, \n
Who nobly perish'd in their sovereign's cause: \n
For thou in pity bid'st the war give o'er, \n
Mourn'st thy slain heroes, nor wilt venture more. \n
Vast price of blood on each victorious day! \n
(But Europe's freedom doth that price repay.) \n
Lamented triumphs! when one breath must tell \n
That Marlborough conquer'd, and that Dormer fell. \n
Great queen! whose name strikes haughty monarchs pale, \n
On whose just sceptre hangs Europa's scale, \n
Whose arm like Mercy wounds, decides like Fate, \n
On whose decree the nations anxious wait: \n
From Albion's cliffs thy wide-extended hand \n
Shall o'er the main to far Peru command; \n
So vast a tract whose wide domain shall run, \n
Its circling skies shall see no setting sun. \n
Thee, thee an hundred languages shall claim, \n
And savage Indians swear by Anna's name; \n
The line and poles shall own thy rightful sway, \n
And thy commands the sever'd globe obey. \n
Round the vast ball thy new dominions chain \n
The watery kingdoms, and control the main; \n
Magellan's straits to Gibraltar they join, \n
Across the seas a formidable line; \n
The sight of adverse Gaul we fear no more, \n
But pleas'd see Dunkirk, now a guiltless shore; \n
In vain great Neptune tore the narrow ground, \n
And meant his waters for Britannia's bound; \n
Her giant genius takes a mighty stride, \n
And sets his foot beyond the encroaching tide; \n
On either bank the land its master knows, \n
And in the midst the subject ocean flows. \n
So near proud Rhodes, across the raging flood, \n
Stupendous form! the vast Colossus stood, \n
(While at one foot their thronging gallies ride, \n
A whole hour's sail scarce reach the further side) \n
Betwixt his brazen thighs, in loose array, \n
Ten thousand streamers on the billows play. \n
By Harley's counsels, Dunkirk, now restor'd \n
To Britain's empire, owns her ancient lord, \n
In him transfus'd his godlike father reigns, \n
Rich in the blood which swell'd that patriot's veins, \n
Who, boldly faithful, met his sovereign's frown, \n
And scorn'd for gold to yield th' important town. \n
His son was born the ravish'd prey to claim, \n
And France still trembles at an Harley's name. \n
A fort so dreadful to our English shore, \n
Our fleets scarce fear'd the sands or tempests more, \n
Whose vast expenses to such sums amount, \n
That the tax'd Gaul scarce furnish'd out th' account, \n
Whose walls such bulwarks, such vast towers restrain, \n
Its weakest ramparts are the rocks and main, \n
His boast great Louis yields, and cheaply buys \n
Thy friendship, Anna, with the mighty prize. \n
Holland repining, and in grief cast down, \n
Sees the new glories of the British crown: \n
Ah! may they ne'er provoke thee to the fight, \n
Nor foes, more dreadful than the Gaul, invite. \n
Soon may they hold the olive, soon asswage \n
Their secret murmurs, nor call forth thy rage \n
To rend their banks, and pour, at one command, \n
Thy realm, the sea, o'er their precarious land. \n
Henceforth be thine, vice-gerent of the skies, \n
Scorn'd worth to raise, and vice in robes chastise, \n
To dry the orphan's tears, and from the bar, \n
Chace the brib'd judge, and hush the wordy war, \n
Deny the curst blasphemer's tongue to rage, \n
And turn God's fury from an impious age. \n
Blest change! the soldier's late destroying hand \n
Shall rear new temples in his native land; \n
Mistaken zealots shall with fear behold, \n
And beg admittance in our sacred fold; \n
On her own works the pious queen shall smile, \n
And turn her cares upon her favourite isle. \n
So the keen bolt a warrior angel aims, \n
Array'd in clouds, and wrapt in mantling flames; \n
He bears a tempest on his sounding wings, \n
And his red arm the forky vengeance flings; \n
At length, Heaven's wrath appeas'd, he quits the war, \n
To roll his orb, and guide his destin'd star, \n
To shed kind fate, and lucky hours bestow, \n
And smile propitious on the world below. \n
Around thy throne shall faithful nobles wait, \n
These guard the church, and those direct the state. \n
To Bristol, graceful in maternal tears, \n
The Church her towery forehead gently rears; \n
She begs her pious son t' assert her cause \n
Defend her rights, and reenforce her laws, \n
With holy zeal the sacred work begin, \n
To bend the stubborn, and the meek to win. \n
Our Oxford's earl in careful thought shall stand, \n
To raise his queen, and save a sinking land. \n
The wealthiest glebe to ravenous Spaniards known \n
He marks, and makes the golden world our own, \n
Content with hands unsoil'd to guard the prize, \n
And keep the store with undesiring eyes. \n
So round the tree, that bore Hesperian gold, \n
The sacred watch lay curl'd in many a fold, \n
His eyes up-rearing to th' untasted prey, \n
The sleepless guardian wasted life away. \n
Beneath the peaceful olives, rais'd by you, \n
Her ancient pride, shall every art renew, \n
(The arts with you fam'd Harcourt shall defend, \n
And courtly Bolingbroke the Muse's friend.) \n
With piercing eye some search where Nature plays, \n
And trace the wanton through her darksome maze, \n
Whence health from herbs; from seeds how groves begun, \n
How vital streams in circling eddies run. \n
Some teach why round the Sun the spheres advance, \n
In the fix'd measures of their mystic dance, \n
How tides, when heav'd by pressing moons, o'erflow, \n
And sun-born Iris paints her showery bow, \n
In happy chains our daring language bound, \n
Shall sport no more in arbitrary sound, \n
But buskin'd bards henceforth shall wisely rage, \n
And Grecian plans reform Britannia's stage: \n
Till Congreve bids her smile, Augusta stands \n
And longs to weep when flowing Rowe commands. \n
Britain's Spectators shall their strength combine \n
To mend our morals and our taste refine, \n
Fight virtue's cause, stand up in wit's defence, \n
Win us from vice, and laugh us into sense. \n
Nor, Prior, hast thou hush'd the trump in vain, \n
Thy lyre shall now revive her mirthful strain, \n
New tales shall now be told; if right I see, \n
The soul of Chaucer is restor'd in thee. \n
Garth, in majestic numbers, to the stars \n
Shall raise mock heroes, and fantastic wars; \n
Like the young spreading laurel, Pope, thy name \n
Shoots up with strength, and rises into fame; \n
With Philips shall the peaceful vallies ring, \n
And Britain hear a second Spenser sing. \n
That much-lov'd youth, whom Utrecht's walls confine, \n
To Bristol's praises shall his Strafford's join: \n
He too, from whom attentive Oxford draws \n
Rules for just thinking, and poetic laws, \n
To growing bards his learned aid shall lend, \n
The strictest critic, and the kindest friend. \n
Ev'n mine, a bashful Muse, whose rude essays \n
Scarce hope for pardon, not aspire to praise, \n
Cherish'd by you, in time may grow to fame, \n
And mine survive with Bristol's glorious name. \n
Fir'd with the views this glittering scene displays, \n
And smit with passion for my country's praise, \n
My artless reed attempts this lofty theme, \n
Where sacred Isis rolls her ancient stream; \n
In cloister'd domes, the great Philippa's pride, \n
Where Learning blooms, while Fame and Worth preside, \n
Where the fifth Henry arts and arms was taught, \n
And Edward form'd his Cressy, yet unfought, \n
Where laurel'd bards have struck the warbling strings, \n
The seat of sages, and the nurse of kings. \n
Here thy commands, O Lancaster, inflame \n
My eager breast to raise the British name, \n
Urge on my soul, with no ignoble pride, \n
To woo the Muse, whom Addison enjoy'd, \n
See that bold swan to Heaven sublimely soar, \n
Pursue at distance, and his steps adore. \n<|endoftext|>

Of Morris Motors fame, \n
William Richard was his name \n
William Richard Morris Nuffield \n
Viscount Baron, born in Britain \n
eighteen seventy-seven...died \n
in Britain nineteen sixty-three. \n
His success story began with \n
a humble cycle repair shop, \n
but there, business did not stop as \n
eventually Morris Motors did thrive \n
and in nineteen-twenty, the Morris \n
Cowley was a popular car to drive. \n
What could be finer than a black \n
Morris Minor...I once owned one myself \n
and happy was I. In later years \n
Morris and Austin 'merged' as part of \n
British Leyland. William was made \n
Viscount ~ the founder of a motor \n
car empire, giving his millions to \n
Medical Research, and setting \n
hearts afire. He was Founder of the \n
Nuffield College and the Nuffield \n
Foundation, bringing a touch of magic \n
to our striving nation. Britain will \n
ever remember this interesting and \n
important step in industrial salvation. \n<|endoftext|>

Fast Car \n
You got a fast car \n
I want a ticket to anywhere \n
Maybe we make a deal \n
Maybe together we can get somewhere \n
Anyplace is better \n
Starting from zero got nothing to lose \n
Maybe we'll make something \n
But me myself I got nothing to prove \n
You got a fast car \n
And I got a plan to get us out of here \n
I been working at the convenience store \n
Managed to save just a little bit of money \n
We won't have to drive too far \n
Just 'cross the border and into the city \n
You and I can both get jobs \n
And finally see what it means to be living \n
You see my old man's got a problem \n
He live with the bottle that's the way it is \n
He says his body's too old for working \n
I say his body's too young to look like his \n
My mama went off and left him \n
She wanted more from life than he could give \n
I said somebody's got to take care of him \n
So I quit school and that's what I did \n
You got a fast car \n
But is it fast enough so we can fly away \n
We gotta make a decision \n
We leave tonight or live and die this way \n
I remember we were driving driving in your car \n
The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk \n
City lights lay out before us \n
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder \n
And I had a feeling that I belonged \n
And I had feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone \n
You got a fast car \n
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves \n
You still ain't got a job \n
And I work in a market as a checkout girl \n
I know things will get better \n
You'll find work and I'll get promoted \n
We'll move out of the shelter \n
Buy a big house and live in the suburbs \n
You got a fast car \n
And I got a job that pays all our bills \n
You stay out drinking late at the bar \n
See more of your friends than you do of your kids \n
I'd always hoped for better \n
Thought maybe together you and me would find it \n
I got no plans I ain't going nowhere \n
So take your fast car and keep on driving \n
You got a fast car \n
But is it fast enough so you can fly away \n
You gotta make a decision \n
You leave tonight or live and die this way \n

car \n
The railroad dick looked straight at him, eyes unwavering, beady-eyed, menacing, and Harry counted his change to see if there was enough for a bribe; searched his thoughts for an escape route, but he was not as young as he used to be and the dick was young, legs like a deer. \n
He tussled Barney’s hair and said: \n
“Go there in that thar car and wait for me, got to dump the dick. Wait for my whistle.” \n
Barney looked up him hesitantly and Harry stammered hoarsely \n
“Go! ” \n
Barney scrambled on all fours the way Harry had taught him and quickly disappeared under cover of the dark Chicago night. \n
Always, the dick against the Bos, the rich against the poor was Harry’s thought, been that way since her was born, the wanders, the lose, the lose people on the road trying to find an odd job and a meal, against the railroad fat cats trying to exterminate the railroad people, who what was just trying to get by. \n
Harry held his breath and told himself to concentrate and finally turned back to the dick and showed himself, full on so as the dick could get a good look at him. The dick wide-eyed and incredulous stared hard at Harry surprised by the brazenness of the tramp and stood stock still for a moment, prey in the eyes of the predator. \n
Harry swayed a little left and then a little right like a running back taunting the linebacker, which way boy, am I going to bolt, which way is the question. Harry feinted a dash to the right and the dick crouched right ready for the chase, Harry smiled and then feinted to the left, testing the dick’s reflexes. The dick danced to the left enjoying the thrilling moment before the chase. \n
Harry guessed Barney had had time to secure himself in the car and then dashed straight toward the dick, who was thoroughly surprised and steeled himself for what he thought would be a crash between the two men. But Harry at the last minute slanted right allowing the dick to remain close behind but not enough to lay hand on him. \n
He headed for track 13 for the Great Northern line car. \n
The dick was breathing behind him; Harry could hear his labored breaths, close enough but not close enough to grab, what was what Harry wanted. \n
He hit the Northern line yard and saw number 13 looming. The dick was laughing behind him yelping with the sheer joy of it all, feeling he had Harry cornered because the Northern lot was a closed in one, a big wall in the back, a closed station and of course cars, most closed. \n
But Harry was aiming toward 13 and left up into the car and waited for the dick to catch up and see him. Harry looked down at the man’s heaving chest smiling his best Harry smile. \n

June-July with its divine hues comes every year; \n
Bringing car festival of its kind very rare, \n
Heaven of earth as people call it is Puri Dham, \n
Becomes lively, vibrant and colourful, \n
When Gods from heaven up above \n
Descend here to share joys with devotees so rare. \n
Three deities in three colourful and huge wooden Chariots; \n
Thousands of people pulling them to a distance of three furlongs, \n
From Srimandira to Gundicha Temple under scorching sun, \n
Ecstatic are devotees beating sun and pulling chariots, \n
And screaming Oh Lord, stay with us, don't go away, \n
Let thy presence be always felt by us and not shine away, \n
And the Chariots roll down the grand road to destination not far away. \n
Millions of pilgrims throng the grand road; \n
To have darshan (Holy view) of our beloved lords, \n
Passing by in Chariots, touching our body, mind and soul, \n
Cleansing thousand births' sins just on viewing our Lords, \n
Devotees beating drums, dancing, singing in praise of Gods, \n
And the air filled with divine ecstasies, loves and sounds of choirs, \n
Seemingly mesmerizing Gods in heaven up above, \n
To descend on hallowed grand road to mingle with devotees-behold. \n
Embrace all, enthral all, love all and mingle with all; \n
Irrespective of castes, creeds and religions, \n
Our lords are symbolic of Brahma, Bishnu and Maheswara, \n
Stand for Sanatana Dharma as universal God or religion, \n
They are Lord Jagannath, Lord Balabhadra and Goddess Subhadra, \n
Adoring the Chariots over the grand road pulled toward destination, \n
And as life's chariot o'er Time's grand road is drawn, \n
Our Lord Jagannath knows the way and destination, \n
While the rumbling wheels go on. \n<|endoftext|>

You pull into a car park \n
and they spring out of nowhere. \n
“Do you want your car washed \n
while you’re doing your shopping? \n
We do not charge a lot.” \n
My answer is no. \n
“Sorry mate but my car is under scientific study. \n
I am an insect- ornithologist. \n
I study bird droppings and insect splatters. \n
I get out every night with my tweezers, \n
take the remaining bits off, \n
and put them in a specimen jar. \n
I am also going in for \n
the dirtiest car of the year award. \n
I have won it three times already. \n
So you see my car does not need a wash thank you.” \n
They look at me somewhat strangely \n
before they go on their merry way. \n
Therefore, the next time you pull into a car park \n
and someone wants to wash your car. \n
Just tell them you are an insect-ornithologist \n
engaged in a scientific study. \n
They will never understand what you mean. \n
They might think you are somewhat strange, \n
but you will save yourself a packet. \n
Now that ain’t strange, that is wise. \n

Did a dentist named Dr. George Trusty could have done it? \n
Did dentist don the disco dance that put Brandy Fanning singin’ the blues? \n
Did the dentist know what has he done, his moves of body that do not quite fit, \n
His moves that would jeopardize his patients health as I heard today on the news? \n
Croce wouldn’t have done this, neither Rose Royce, \n
Kickin’ their songs about car washes, \n
But Trusty knew he had choice, \n
About doctoring the person in his chair, \n
About being serious, when you drill in to their mouth, \n
It is though he couldn’t care, \n
About his dentistry, may all his patient, beware. \n
He cracked a bit in nasal cavity, \n
He told her to sneeze, \n
He said something gone wrong, \n
She should blow out with ease. \n

Close voices breathe, "Poor sweet, he did his best." \n
"Poor sweet, poor sweet," the bird-hushed glades repeat, \n

What an underrated book, I remember thinking. \n
Yes, I know it’s famous, but \n
You don’t usually find it on \n
Anyone’s top ten. \n
Not even top twenty. \n
You probably read it back in your \n
Treasure Island years. \n
If you read it again, I’m sure you’ll \n
Discover new insights swooshing off the page \n
Like little geysers. \n
Savoring the rich language that careens towards you with \n
Bright headlights while you’re crossing the Old Coast Road, \n
I’m sure you’ll move it up a few notches, \n
Maybe even into your twenty. \n<|endoftext|>

Sometimes I wake up hating the world \n
Caring for no one in it \n
Doing only what stress reviled \n
And ignoring what isn’t \n
Pain flows through my body \n
Quite often, frequently \n
Sulking becomes a hobby \n
And draws attention to me unpleasantly \n
Regretting my decisions \n
Wishing I were someone else \n
Somebody with vision \n
Anyone but myself \n
Hating everything about me \n
Wishing I were done \n
Leave my past behind me \n
And just, run \n
Hiding forever behind every tree \n

Enabling you to see \n

Ripping at my hair \n
Pinching at my chest \n
Unable to bare \n

Well designed publicity by those who earn high pay. \n

The more that some Christians change, the more they remain the same, \n
For many people who claim to be saved, are only Christians in name. \n
Christianity is not simply a religion for man to deal with strife, \n
But it's God personally reaching down to man to offer him new life. \n
Change in one's life is not simply an option for each Child of God, \n
For we were commanded to leave behind the path we once had trod. \n
Although we live in the world, we're not to be of the world we're in, \n
For God's desire for us would be hindered if we get entangled in sin. \n
Christians are sealed by The Holy Spirit until the day of redemption, \n
You are then set apart for the work of The Lord, with no Exemption. \n
Our lives belong to God, as He purchased us with the blood of Christ, \n
Christ is where we place our trust, as we become a living sacrifice. \n
And it's to the patterns of this world we are not to be conformed, \n
Instead it's through the Word that renews, we are to be transformed. \n
For all in Christ, the old passes away as we become a New Creation, \n
And God, who has reconciled us, give us a ministry of reconciliation. \n
So our lives should now be used to reach others with God's Salvation, \n
It should be our compassion to reach every tribe, tongue and nation. \n
So today is the day to let The Lord inside and really make a change, \n
And just like John the Baptist my friend, you will never be the same. \n

A very wise person once wrote that it’s \n
The choices we make that define the person we are. \n
The decision you’ve made to change your name \n
Is one of the most important choices you’ll ever make — \n
Something no one else can do for you. \n
Just like the butterfly that emerges from the chrysalis, \n
Changing your name heralds a new stage in your life. \n

Change is inevitable, \n
But yet we fight it, just the same. \n
Change is essential to our evolution. \n
Change is going to happen, \n
In fact, it happens every day, \n
Maybe it is too small to see, or perhaps we would rather not see it. \n
We fight change, because we fight the unknown, \n
We fight the unknown, because we are scared, \n
Scared of change, scared of the unknown. \n
If we were to allow change to happen freely, \n
We might find solutions to the problems that exist around us, \n
But instead, we are hung - up on controlling everything around us. \n
Maybe this is the problem with the world today. \n
Everyone assumes control of everything and does not allow nature to run her course. \n
Maybe this is why, we have devastating fall out from Nature, \n
Natural catastrophic disasters, such as fire and flooding. \n
We fight change, therefore we are fighting nature and her natural being and her existence \n
in the world that she has created by God's hand and has graciously allowed us to be a \n
part of. \n
We should welcome change and allow nature to control our destiny. \n
Change is uncontrollable, \n
Change is inevitable, \n
Change is the unknown. \n
Nature takes pride in being one of life's illusive wonders, the unknown. \n<|endoftext|>

Long enough, \n
It is time. \n
I’ll show this world, \n
That I can survive. \n
One side of me, \n
Is exposed to the world, \n

Slowly at first, \n

Only to dazzle. \n

Free to show myself, \n

In all my splendor. \n

a breathless sky and the autumn as beautiful \n

The way it was just yesterday \n
when you held me against your chest, against \n
a backdropp of sunset: so many colors \n
evolving into darkness- rearranging themselves \n
into the first evening shadows. \n
I want to sleep with the memory of you \n
still fresh inside of my head, and the scent \n
of your kisses still clinging to my lips. \n
Your eyes: cathartic pools I wish I could dive into, \n
to drown myself in their prismatic vision. \n
How does it feel to see the world, to see life \n
through a third eye? \n
I wish I could see beyond my sorrow and live \n
beyond my darkness- then I’d see myself \n
not entirely unraveled, but tearing at the seams \n

Now the new chum loaded his three-nought-three, \n
It's a small-bore gun, but his hopes were big. \n
"I am fed to the teeth with old ewe," said he, \n
"And I might be able to shoot a pig." \n
And he trusted more to his nose than ear \n
To give him warning when pigs were near. \n
Out of his lair in the lignum dark. \n
Where the wild duck nests and the bilbie digs, \n
With a whoof and a snort and a kind of bark \n
There rose the father of all the pigs: \n
And a tiger would have walked wide of him \n
As he stropped his tusks on a leaning limb. \n
Then the new chum's three-nought-three gave tongue \n
Like a popgun fired in an opera bouffe: \n
But a pig that was old when the world was young \n
Is near as possible bullet-proof. \n
(The more you shoot him the less he dies, \n
Unless you catch him between the eyes.) \n
So the new chum saw it was up to him \n
To become extinct if he stopped to shoot; \n
So he made a leap for a gidgee limb \n
While the tusker narrowly missed his boot. \n
Then he found a fork, where he swayed in air \n
As he gripped the boughs like a native bear. \n
The pig sat silent and gaunt and grim \n
To wait and wait till his foe should fall: \n
For night and day were the same to him, \n
And home was any old place at all. \n
"I must wait," said he, "till this sportsman drops; \n
I could use his boots for a pair of strops." \n
The crows that watch from the distant blue \n
Came down to see what it all might mean; \n
An eaglehawk and a cockatoo \n
Bestowed their patronage on the scene. \n
Till a far-off boundary rider said \n
"I must have a look -- there is something dead." \n
Now the new chum sits at his Christmas fare \n
Of a dried-up chop from a tough old ewe. \n
Says he, "It's better than native bear \n
And nearly as tender as kangaroo. \n
An emu's egg I can masticate, \n
But pork," says he, "is the thing I hate." \n<|endoftext|>

The Cities are full of pride, \n
Challenging each to each -- \n
This from her mountain-side, \n
That from her burthened beach. \n

Their corn and oil and wine, \n
Derrick and loom and bale, \n
And rampart's gun-flecked line; \n
City by City they hail: \n
"Hast aught to match with mine?" \n
And the men that breed from them \n
They traffic up and down, \n
But cling to their cities' hem \n
As a child to their mother's gown. \n
When they talk with the stranger bands, \n
Dazed and newly alone; \n
When they walk in the stranger lands, \n
By roaring streets unknown; \n
Blessing her where she stands \n
For strength above their own. \n

That stands all fame beyond, \n
By oath to back the same, \n
Most faithful-foolish-fond; \n
Making her mere-breathed name \n
Their bond upon their bond.) \n
So thank I God my birth \n
Fell not in isles aside -- \n
Waste headlands of the earth, \n
Or warring tribes untried -- \n
But that she lent me worth \n
And gave me right to pride. \n
Surely in toil or fray \n
Under an alien sky, \n
Comfort it is to say: \n
"Of no mean city am I!" \n

Come I to mine estate -- \n
Mother of Cities to me, \n

Where the world-end steamers wait.) \n
Now for this debt I owe, \n

And she shall touch and remit \n
After the use of kings \n

I have read, in some old, marvellous tale, \n
Some legend strange and vague, \n
That a midnight host of spectres pale \n
Beleaguered the walls of Prague. \n
Beside the Moldau's rushing stream, \n
With the wan moon overhead, \n
There stood, as in an awful dream, \n
The army of the dead. \n
White as a sea-fog, landward bound, \n
The spectral camp was seen, \n
And, with a sorrowful, deep sound, \n
The river flowed between. \n
No other voice nor sound was there, \n
No drum, nor sentry's pace; \n
The mist-like banners clasped the air, \n
As clouds with clouds embrace. \n
But when the old cathedral bell \n
Proclaimed the morning prayer, \n
The white pavilions rose and fell \n
On the alarmed air. \n
Down the broad valley fast and far \n
The troubled army fled; \n
Up rose the glorious morning star, \n
The ghastly host was dead. \n
I have read, in the marvellous heart of man, \n
That strange and mystic scroll, \n
That an army of phantoms vast and wan \n
Beleaguer the human soul. \n
Encamped beside Life's rushing stream, \n
In Fancy's misty light, \n
Gigantic shapes and shadows gleam \n
Portentous through the night. \n
Upon its midnight battle-ground \n
The spectral camp is seen, \n
And, with a sorrowful, deep sound, \n
Flows the River of Life between. \n
No other voice nor sound is there, \n
In the army of the grave; \n
No other challenge breaks the air, \n
But the rushing of Life's wave. \n
And when the solemn and deep churchbell \n
Entreats the soul to pray, \n
The midnight phantoms feel the spell, \n
The shadows sweep away. \n
Down the broad Vale of Tears afar \n
The spectral camp is fled; \n
Faith shineth as a morning star, \n
Our ghastly fears are dead. \n<|endoftext|>

The stranger came from Narromine and made his little joke-- \n
"They say we folks in Narromine are narrow-minded folk. \n
But all the smartest men down here are puzzled to define \n
A kind of new phenomenon that came to Narromine. \n
"Last summer up in Narromine 'twas gettin' rather warm-- \n
Two hundred in the water bag, and lookin' like a storm-- \n
We all were in the private bar, the coolest place in town, \n
When out across the stretch of plain a cloud came rollin' down, \n
"We don't respect the clouds up there, they fill us with disgust, \n
They mostly bring a Bogan shower -- three raindrops and some dust; \n
But each man, simultaneous-like, to each man said, 'I think \n
That cloud suggests it's up to us to have another drink!' \n
"There's clouds of rain and clouds of dust -- we've heard of them before, \n
And sometimes in the daily press we read of 'clouds of war': \n
But -- if this ain't the Gospel truth I hope that I may burst-- \n
That cloud that came to Narromine was just a cloud of thirst. \n
"It wasn't like a common cloud, 'twas more a sort of haze; \n
It settled down about the streets, and stopped for days and days, \n
And now a drop of dew could fall and not a sunbeam shine \n
To pierce that dismal sort of mist that hung on Narromine. \n
"Oh, Lord! we had a dreadful time beneath that cloud of thirst! \n
We all chucked up our daily work and went upon the burst. \n
The very blacks about the town that used to cadge for grub, \n
They made an organised attack and tried to loot the pub. \n
"We couldn't leave the private bar no matter how we tried; \n
Shearers and squatters, union men and blacklegs side by side \n
Were drinkin' there and dursn't move, for each was sure, he said, \n
Before he'd get a half a mile the thirst would strike him dead! \n
"We drank until the drink gave out, we searched from room to room, \n
And round the pub, like drunken ghosts, went howling through the gloom. \n
The shearers found some kerosene and settled down again, \n
But all the squatter chaps and I, we staggered to the train. \n
"And, once outside the cloud of thirst, we felt as right as pie, \n
But while we stopped about the town we had to drink or die. \n
But now I hear it's safe enough, I'm going back to work \n
Because they say the cloud of thirst has shifted on to Bourke. \n
"But when you see these clouds about -- like this one over here-- \n
All white and frothy at the top, just like a pint of beer, \n
It's time to go and have a drink, for if that cloud should burst \n
You'd find the drink would all be gone, for that's a cloud of thirst!" \n
We stood the man from Narromine a pint of half-and-half; \n
He drank it off without a gasp in one tremendous quaff; \n
"I joined some friends last night," he said, "in what they called a spree; \n
But after Narromine 'twas just a holiday to me." \n
And now beyond the Western Range, where sunset skies are red, \n
And clouds of dust, and clouds of thirst, go drifting overhead, \n
The railway train is taking back, along the Western Line, \n
That narrow-minded person on his road to Narromine. \n<|endoftext|>

God sits up in Heaven and laughs as the nations imagine a vain thing, \n
For the internationalism of Jerusalem, is the song they seem to sing. \n
And it is far from an original song that all the nations are singing, \n
For God made Jerusalem the center of this world before their being. \n
For God Himself purged the land of Canaan to be the land of the Jew, \n
And He told Moses to prepare to worship at a place I will show you. \n
But Moses never crossed the Jordan and was buried by God's own Hand, \n
And Joshua took over to lead the Israelites into The Promised Land. \n
And from the time of Moses through the Judges wherever the Jews went, \n
The Ark of God's Covenant and the Glory of God remained under a tent. \n
It was not until God gave Israel rest under King David their leader, \n
That in the City God chose, he desired to make God a house of cedar. \n
The City that God chose was Jerusalem, on which He placed His Name, \n
For it is The City of David, and on it God's Name will always remain. \n
God remembered His Promise to David, and his desire was not ignored, \n
For God had told David's son Solomon to build a temple for The Lord. \n
Then God consecrated this temple by putting His Name on it forever, \n
And this promise to Solomon by God, He can not and He will not sever. \n
So even though things look quite gloomy in Jerusalem today my friend, \n
Zechariah says The Lord will inherit Judah to choose Jerusalem again. \n

city \n
The gaudy glow of neon lights \n
dispels the darkness of the nights \n
on city streets. \n
They pop and fizzle noisily \n
creating a cacophony \n
on city streets. \n
The sober folks walk warily \n
and drunks stagger uncaringly \n
on city streets. \n
The ladies of the night parade \n
for there is money to be made \n
on city streets. \n
Drug dealers ready to retreat \n
if they should hear a coppers feet \n
on city streets. \n
The night shift workers wend their way \n
towards their work to start their day \n
on city streets. \n
The noisy revellers thin out \n
as one by one the signs go out \n
on city streets. \n
The gradually noises abate \n
and ghostly shadow congregate \n
on city streets. \n
For some few hours peace will reign \n
before the noise will start again \n
on city streets. \n
The early morning traffic sounds \n
start with the milkmen on their rounds \n
on city streets. \n
This builds up to an angry roar \n
as cars and lorries inward pour \n
on city streets \n
then when at last rush hour has passed \n
noise levels will subside at last \n
on city streets \n
I thank the lord that I am free \n
to leave this noise far behind me \n
on city streets. \n
I walked my beat the whole night \n
through exactly as I’m paid to do \n
on city streets. \n
I choose to live outside the town \n
where constant noise won’t get me down \n
on city streets. \n
My village is a quiet place \n
A haven where I need not face \n
the noisy streets. \n

Not in the solitude \n
Alone may man commune with heaven, or see \n
Only in savage wood \n
And sunny vale, the present Deity; \n
Or only hear his voice \n
Where the winds whisper and the waves rejoice. \n
Even here do I behold \n
Thy steps, Almighty!--here, amidst the crowd, \n
Through the great city rolled, \n
With everlasting murmur deep and loud-- \n
Choking the ways that wind \n
'Mongst the proud piles, the work of humankind. \n
Thy golden sunshine comes \n
From the round heaven, and on their dwellings lies, \n
And lights their inner homes; \n
For them thou fill'st with air the unbounded skies, \n
And givest them the stores \n
Of ocean, and the harvests of its shores. \n
Thy spirit is around, \n
Quickening the restless mass that sweeps along; \n
And this eternal sound-- \n
Voices and footfalls of the numberless throng-- \n
Like the resounding sea, \n
Or like the rainy tempest, speaks of thee. \n
And when the hours of rest \n
Come, like a calm upon the mid-sea brine, \n
Hushing its billowy breast-- \n
The quiet of that moment too is thine; \n
It breathes of him who keeps \n

I once walked by the saddest city lane \n
And saw an old man there, all ragged and plain. \n
He sat alone by a glowing fires flaring light \n
An empty wine bottle before him, a sorry, sorry sight. \n
All he wanted was some shelter and to forget pain, \n
But the night would spite him that, all it’d bring is cold rain. \n
And I just walked on, on in wonder, on towards home \n
Remembering fire in his eyes with mine on the gloam. \n<|endoftext|>

What are you able to build with your blocks? \n
Castles and palaces, temples and docks. \n
Rain may keep raining, and others go roam, \n
But I can be happy and building at home. \n
Let the sofa be mountains, the carpet be sea, \n
There I'll establish a city for me: \n
A kirk and a mill and a palace beside, \n
And a harbor as well where my vessels may ride. \n
Great is the palace with pillar and wall, \n
A sort of a tower on top of it all, \n
And steps coming down in an orderly way \n
To where my toy vessels lie safe in the bay. \n
This one is sailing and that one is moored: \n
Hark to the song of the sailors on board! \n
And see on the steps of my palace, the kings \n
Coming and going with presents and things! \n<|endoftext|>

You said, "I will go to another land, I will go to another sea. \n
Another city will be found, a better one than this. \n
Every effort of mine is a condemnation of fate; \n

How long will my mind remain in this wasteland. \n
Wherever I turn my eyes, wherever I may look \n
I see black ruins of my life here, \n
where I spent so many years destroying and wasting." \n
You will find no new lands, you will find no other seas. \n
The city will follow you. You will roam the same \n
streets. And you will age in the same neighborhoods; \n
and you will grow gray in these same houses. \n
Always you will arrive in this city. Do not hope for any other -- \n
There is no ship for you, there is no road. \n
As you have destroyed your life here \n
in this little corner, you have ruinded it in the entire world. \n<|endoftext|>

Yesterday I drew myself from the noisome throngs and proceeded into the field until I reached a knoll upon which Nature had spread her comely garments. Now I could breathe. \n
I looked back, and the city appeared with its magnificent mosques and stately residences veiled by the smoke of the shops. \n
I commenced analyzing man's mission, but could conclude only that most of his life was identified with struggle and hardship. Then I tried not to ponder over what the sons of Adam had done, and centered my eyes on the field which is the throne of God's glory. In one secluded corner of the field I observed a burying ground surrounded by poplar trees. \n
There, between the city of the dead and the city of the living, I meditated. I thought of the eternal silence in the first and the endless sorrow in the second. \n
In the city of the living I found hope and despair; love and hatred, joy and sorrow, wealth and poverty, faith and infidelity. \n
In the city of the dead there is buried earth in earth that Nature converts, in the night's silence, into vegetation, and then into animal, and then into man. As my mind wandered in this fashion, I saw a procession moving slowly and reverently, accompanied by pieces of music that filled the sky with sad melody. It was an elaborate funeral. The dead was followed by the living who wept and lamented his going. As the cortege reached the place of interment the priests commenced praying and burning incense, and musicians blowing and plucking their instruments, mourning the departed. Then the leaders came forward one after the other and recited their eulogies with fine choice of words. \n
At last the multitude departed, leaving the dead resting in a most spacious and beautiful vault, expertly designed in stone and iron, and surrounded by the most expensively-entwined wreaths of flowers. \n
The farewell-bidders returned to the city and I remained, watching them from a distance and speaking softly to myself while the sun was descending to the horizon and Nature was making her many preparations for slumber. \n
Then I saw two men laboring under the weight of a wooden casket, and behind them a shabby-appearing woman carrying an infant on her arms. Following last was a dog who, with heartbreaking eyes, stared first at the woman and then at the casket. \n
It was a poor funeral. This guest of Death left to cold society a miserable wife and an infant to share her sorrows and a faithful dog whose heart knew of his companion's departure. \n
As they reached the burial place they deposited the casket into a ditch away from the tended shrubs and marble stones, and retreated after a few simple words to God. The dog made one last turn to look at his friend's grave as the small group disappeared behind the trees. \n
I looked at the city of the living and said to myself, "That place belongs to the few." Then I looked upon the trim city of the dead and said, "That place, too, belongs to the few. Oh Lord, where is the haven of all the people?" \n
As I said this, I looked toward the clouds, mingled with the sun's longest and most beautiful golden rays. And I heard a voice within me saying, "Over there!" \n<|endoftext|>

ONCE I pass'd through a populous city, imprinting my brain, for \n
future use, with its shows, architecture, customs, and \n
traditions; \n
Yet now, of all that city, I remember only a woman I casually met \n
there, who detain'd me for love of me; \n
Day by day and night by night we were together,--All else has long \n
been forgotten by me; \n
I remember, I say, only that woman who passionately clung to me; \n
Again we wander--we love--we separate again; \n
Again she holds me by the hand--I must not go! \n
I see her close beside me, with silent lips, sad and tremulous. \n<|endoftext|>

Nor stillness so cold, nor running water from faucet, nor odors \n

Or white-domed Capitol itself, with majestic figure surmounted--or \n

Take one tear, dropt aside as I go, for thought of you, \n
Dead house of love! house of madness and sin, crumbled! crush'd! \n

city \n
Cruising these residential Sunday \n
streets in dry August sunlight: \n
what offends us is \n
the sanities: \n
the houses in pedantic rows, the planted \n
sanitary trees, assert \n
levelness of surface like a rebuke \n
to the dent in our car door. \n
No shouting here, or \n
shatter of glass; nothing more abrupt \n
than the rational whine of a power mower \n
cutting a straight swath in the discouraged grass. \n
But though the driveways neatly \n
sidestep hysteria \n
by being even, the roofs all display \n
the same slant of avoidance to the hot sky, \n
certain things: \n
the smell of spilled oil a faint \n
sickness lingering in the garages, \n
a splash of paint on brick surprising as a bruise, \n
a plastic hose poised in a vicious \n
coil; even the too-fixed stare of the wide windows \n
give momentary access to \n
the landscape behind or under \n
the future cracks in the plaster \n
when the houses, capsized, will slide \n
obliquely into the clay seas, gradual as glaciers \n
that right now nobody notices. \n
That is where the City Planners \n
with the insane faces of political conspirators \n
are scattered over unsurveyed \n
territories, concealed from each other, \n
each in his own private blizzard; \n
guessing directions, they sketch \n
transitory lines rigid as wooden borders \n
on a wall in the white vanishing air \n
tracing the panic of suburb \n
order in a bland madness of snows \n<|endoftext|>

The village of Penicuik, with its neighbouring spinning mills, \n
Is most lovely to see, and the Pentland Hills; \n
And though of a barren appearance and some parts steep, \n
They are covered with fine pasture and sustain flocks of sheep. \n
There, tourists while there should take a good look, \n
By viewing the surrounding beauties of Penicuik; \n
About three miles south-west is the romantic locality \n
Of Newhall, which is most fascinating and charming to see. \n
Then about half a mile above Newhall the River Esk is seen, \n
Which sparkles like crystal in the sun's sheen; \n
And on the Esk there's a forking ridge forming a linn \n
Betwixt two birch trees, which makes a noisy din. \n
And on a rocky protuberance close by is Mary Stuart's bower \n
Where Scotland's ill-starred Queen spent many an hour, \n
Which is composed of turf and a nice round seat \n
Commanding a full view of the linn- the sight is quite a treat. \n
Then there's Habbie's Howe, where the beauties of summer grow, \n
Which cannot be excelled in Scotland for pastoral show; \n
Tis one of the most beautiful landscapes in fair Scotland, \n
For the scenery there is most charming and grand. \n
Then ye tourists to the village of Penicuik haste away, \n
And there spend the lovely summer day \n
By climbing the heathy, barren Pentland Hills, \n
And drink the pure water from their crystal rills. \n<|endoftext|>

On a warm sultry night last August, \n
I went to a rock concert featuring Liz Phair \n
And several other female artists. \n
A male friend of mine couldn’t go with me, \n
But I didn’t really mind, I love music so much \n
That I never want to talk or think about anything but the show. \n
Once I was there, though, I ran into three female friends: \n
Erica, Diana, and Soha! \n
I was as nearly as exited to see them as Liz; \n
If I had been a puppy, \n
My little tail would have been \n
Ecstatically wagging! \n
I was in the front row and toward the end of the show, \n
I reached my hand toward Liz Phair wanting \n
To slightly touch her, but she placed a guitar pick \n
Into my outstretched hand, I thought I might have a heart attack! \n
My three friends were cheering me on like perfect angels! \n
When the show was over, I walked out with my three friends. \n
The concert was promoted by a makeup company, \n
And they were giving out free packets of makeup. \n
My three friends, all beautiful ladies, took one; \n
Being right on their heels, I also took one. \n
The woman handing out the makeup gave me a peculiar look, \n
But I never thought about it, but Erica, being the most wonderfully \n
Outspoken and lovely woman, asked me almost accusingly, \n
“Are you going to use that, Uriah? ” Innocently I replied, \n
“What is it? ” Soha joined in, “Eyeliner. Can I have it? ” \n
I had never used eyeliner before and had no real intentions to start, \n
So I was quite happy to give it to Soha! \n
But on the way home from the show I thought, \n
I’m glad they weren’t giving out tampons, \n
I probably would have taken a handful of those, too! \n<|endoftext|>

Ye lovers of the picturesque, if ye wish to drown your grief, \n
Take my advice, and visit the ancient town of Crieff; \n
The climate is bracing, and the walks lovely to see. \n
Besides, ye can ramble over the district, and view the beautiful scenery. \n
The town is admirably situated from the cold winter winds, \n
And the visitors, during their stay there, great comfort finds, \n
Because there is boating and fishing, and admission free, \n
Therefore they can enjoy themselves right merrily. \n
There is also golf courses, tennis greens, and good roads, \n
Which will make the travelling easier to tourists with great loads, \n
And which will make the bicyclists' hearts feel gay, \n
Because they have everything there to make an enjoyable holiday. \n
The principal river there is the Earn, rolling on its way, \n
And which flows from Loch Earn, and joins the silvery Tay \n
Above Newburgh, after a course of more than thirty miles; \n
And as the tourist views the scene with joy he smiles. \n
The princely domain of Drummond Castle is most beautiful to be seen, \n
Especially when the woody landscape is blown full green, \n
And from the entrance gate to the castle an avenue extends all the way, \n
And to view the branches of the frees interlacing makes the heart feel gay. \n
Drummond Castle's flowery gardens are really very grand; \n
They cannot be surpassed in Great Britain, \n
And in the summer-time the bee and the butterfly are there on the wing, \n
And with the carolling of birds the gardens doth ring. \n
And from Knock Hill on the north and west, \n
The view from its summit is considered the best; \n
Because the Grampians and the Ochils can be seen, \n
While the beautiful rich fertile valley lies between. \n
And there are many seats where the weary traveller can rest, \n
And there is also a fountain of water, the very best, \n
While visitors can drink of while resting there, \n
And gaze on the magnificent scenery and inhale the pure air. \n
Then there's Lady Mary's Walk near the Bridge of Turret, \n
Which I hope visitors will go and see and not forget, \n
Because near by grows a magnificent oak most lovely to see, \n
Which is known by the name of Eppie Callum's Tree. \n
And at each end of this walk the visitors can ascend Laggan Hill, \n
And as they view the woods and fields with joy their hearts \n
And they will find seats plenteous on this elevated bower, \n
On which they may rest and wile away the hour. \n
The Hydropathic is situated on an eminence most grand, \n
And is one of the largest buildings in fair Scotland; \n
And capable of accommodating five hundred visitors, who often call there, \n
To recuperate their health and breathe the fragrant air. \n
Then there's Abercairny, which is most beautiful to view, \n
And Her Majesty the Queen visited the grounds in 1842; \n
And the park and the trees has the aspect of a southern scene, \n
And the lovely appearance of it gladdened the heart of our Queen. \n
Then there's the village of Foulis, which tourists ought to see, \n
Because the scenery there is charming and pretty; \n
And there's a sycamore tree there that was planted 300 years ago, \n
And I'm sure the sight thereof will please both high and low. \n
Therefore, in conclusion, to all lovers of the beautiful I will say, \n
If ye really wish to spend an enjoyable holiday, \n
I would recommend Crieff for lovely scenery and pure air; \n
Besides, the climate gives health to many visitors during their stay there. \n<|endoftext|>

CHORUS. \n
Yes, we'll gather at the river, \n
The beautiful, the beautiful river -- \n
Gather with the saints at the river \n
That flows by the throne of God. \n
On the margin of the river, \n
Washing up its silver spray, \n
We will walk and worship ever, \n
All the happy, golden day. \n
Yes, we'll gather at the river, \n
The beautiful, the beautiful river -- \n
Gather with the saints at the river \n
That flows by the throne of God. \n
On the bosom of the river, \n
Where the Saviour-king we own, \n
We shall meet, and sorrow never \n
'Neath the glory of the throne. Cho. \n
Yes, we'll gather at the river, \n
The beautiful, the beautiful river -- \n
Gather with the saints at the river \n
That flows by the throne of God. \n
Ere we reach the shining river, \n
Lay we every burden down; \n
Grace our spirits will deliver, \n
And provide a robe and crown. Cho. \n
Yes, we'll gather at the river, \n
The beautiful, the beautiful river -- \n
Gather with the saints at the river \n
That flows by the throne of God. \n
At the smiling of the river, \n
Rippling with the Saviour's face, \n
Saints, whom death will never sever, \n
Lift their songs of saving grace. Cho. \n
Yes, we'll gather at the river, \n
The beautiful, the beautiful river -- \n
Gather with the saints at the river \n
That flows by the throne of God. \n
Soon we'll reach the shining river, \n
Soon our pilgrimage will cease, \n
Soon our happy hearts will quiver \n
With the melody of peace. Cho. \n
Yes, we'll gather at the river, \n
The beautiful, the beautiful river -- \n
Gather with the saints at the river \n
That flows by the throne of God. \n<|endoftext|>

Dear Johnny, I return my thanks to you; \n
But more than thanks is your due \n
For publishing the scurrilous poetry about me \n
Leaving the Ancient City of Dundee. \n
The rhymster says, we'll weary for your schauchlin' form; \n
But if I'm not mistaken I've seen bonnier than his in a field of corn; \n
And, as I venture to say and really suppose, \n
His form seen in a cornfield would frighten the crows. \n
But, dear Johnny, as you said, he's just a lampoon, \n
And as ugly and as ignorant as a wild baboon; \n
And, as far as I can judge or think, \n
He is a vendor of strong drink. \n
He says my nose would make a peasemeal warrior weep; \n
But I've seen a much bonnier sweep, \n
And a more manly and wiser man \n
Than he is by far, deny it who can! \n
And, in conclusion, I'd have him to beware, \n
And never again to interfere with a poet's hair, \n
Because Christ the Saviour wore long hair, \n
And many more good men, I do declare. \n
Therefore I laugh at such bosh that appears in print. \n
So I hope from me you will take the hint, \n
And never publish such bosh of poetry again, \n
Or else you'll get the famous Weekly News a bad name. \n<|endoftext|>

Standing on the edge of nothingness \n
the wind of regret blowing through me \n
as my deamons dance the ring of deception \n
that I'm becoming more tempted to join \n
'Come, ' I hear them say as they weave \n
'You belong to us, don't you see? \n
The dreams that make you scream, \n
the Dark Mistress that forever stands beside you, \n
everything that makes you who you are \n
is nothing but a beautiful lie to keep you alive.' \n
How do you fight a shadow when you are weak; \n
when misery is engraved into your soul? \n
How do you resist the urge to fade away \n
when all your heart ever feels is pain? \n
Love has long since abanonded me \n
Happiness stopped coming to my door years ago \n
and I have fallen from Grace since the day my heart broke \n
So with nothing to lose \n
and nothing to gain \n
I take my deamons' hand and dance... \n
And the lie takes my life. \n<|endoftext|>

Ye lovers of the picturesque, away, away! \n
To beautiful Comrie and have a holiday; \n
Aud bask in the sunahine and inhale the fragrant air \n
Emanating from the woodlands and shrubberies there. \n
The charming village of Comrie is most lovely to be seen, \n
Especially in the summer season when the trees are green; \n
And near by is Loch Earn and its waters sparkling clear, \n
And as the tourist gazes thereon his spirits it will cheer. \n
Then St. Fillans is a beautiful spot, I must confess, \n
It is really a picture of rural loveliness; \n
Because out of the quiet lake the river ripples merrily, \n
And all round are hills beautiful in shape and nothing uncomely. \n
The rocky knoll to the south is a most seductive place, \n
And in the hotel there visitors will find every solace; \n
And the flower-decked cottages are charming to see, \n
Also handsome villas suitable for visitors of high and low degree. \n
Then there's St. Fillan's Hill, a prehistoric fort, \n
And visitors while there to it should resort; \n
And to the tourist the best approach is from the west, \n
Because in climbing the hill his strength it will test. \n
And descending the hill as best one may, \n
The scene makes the tourist's heart feel gay; \n
And by the west side is reached a wooded deli, \n
And about two hundred yards from that there's St. Fillan's Well. \n
Oh, charming Comrie! I must conclude my lay, \n
And to write in praise of thee I virtually do say \n
That your lovely mountains and silver birches will drive dull care away: \n
Therefore lovers of the picturesque, away, away! \n
To beautiful Comrie end have a holidoy, \n
And I'm sure you will return with spirits, light and gay, \n
After viewing the Sylvan beauties and hoary beeches there, \n
Also pines, ferns, and beautiful oaks, I do declare. \n<|endoftext|>

Ye lovers of the picturesque, away and see \n
Beautiful Balmoral, near by the River Dee; \n
There ye will see the deer browsing on the heathery hills, \n
While adown their sides run clear sparkling rills. \n
Which the traveller can drink of when he feels dry, \n
And admire the dark River Dee near by, \n
Rolling smoothly and silently on its way, \n
Which is most lovely to see on a summer day. \n
There the trout do sport and play \n
During the live-long summer day; \n
Also plenty of salmon are there to be seen, \n
Glittering like silver in the sun's sheen. \n
And the mountains are rugged and wild to be seen, \n
But the woodlands are beautiful when Nature's face is green; \n
There numerous rabbits do gambol all day \n
Amongst the green scrubbery all lively and gay. \n
There's one charming spot most magnificent to be seen, \n
'Tis Balmoral Castle, the Highland Home of our Queen; \n
The surrounding scenery is enchanting to see, \n
While near by rolls past the lovely River Dee. \n
Therefore, ye lovers of the picturesque, away and see \n
Beautiful Balmoral Castle and its grand scenery, \n
And the sight will fill your hearts with glee, \n
As ye walk along the bonnie banks o' the River Dee. \n<|endoftext|>

Young lovers entwined on the grass \n
On a beautiful hot summer's day; \n
Weary new parents breaking into a smile \n
As they watch their kids giggle and play. \n
The excited shriek of a bubbling child \n
As Christmas Day dawns clear; \n
Old grannies bumbling and grumbling \n
About all those 'prices so dear! ' \n
The peaceful look on a wrinkled man's face \n
As he reminisces on times gone past; \n
The perfect layer of untrodden snow \n
And the prisms of light that it casts. \n
The purpley orange setting sun - \n
Sure to rise pure and bright in the morn; \n
The cloudless night sky, embedded with stars \n
That will last from dusk until dawn. \n
The crystalline tears of a beautiful girl \n
On receiving a much adored gift; \n
An undisturbed lake, a shimmering blue, \n
With only pure white swans adrift. \n
The flight of confetti that sways in the wind \n
As the cheerful wedding bells chime; \n
The gleeful mirth of the poetry fan \n
When a poet contrives a bad rhyme! \n
The delicious intensity leading up \n
To a newly found couple's first kiss; \n
An unsure child beaming, fully content \n
Due to a compliment not gone amiss. \n
The merrily burning, friendly log fire, \n
By which a tired cat has curled; \n
I truly believe, and i tell you all now - \n
We live in a beautiful world! \n<|endoftext|>

Something beautiful \n
You gave me, \n
Alive and \n
Needing care, \n
And though I tried \n
To nurture it, \n
It wound up \n
Dead and bare. \n
Something in me \n
Strangled it, \n
Crushed its frail \n
Life out, \n
And having sought \n
To love it \n
I felt shame \n
And guilt \n
And doubt. \n
You gave me then \n
Another gift, \n
Beautiful and fresh. \n
Again I snuffed its spirit out. \n
Again I brought it death, \n
For something in me murderous \n
Upon it took its toll \n
As I tried to nourish it \n
With all my heart and soul. \n
And now I stand \n
Beside my life \n
Of painful memories. \n
Don't let this happen \n
Any more. Oh, don't \n
Allow it, please! \n
Send me to the Grower's School, \n
To learn to nurture free \n
The precious gifts You send my way — \n
To let them grow and be, \n
To join them in a love song \n
Ever beautiful and new, \n
Full of joyous spirit \n
Of gratitude to You. \n<|endoftext|>
sister \n
My name is Olaf Dangelmaier \n
I am accused to be a liar, \n
a traitor to the King at that \n
a coward, ugly like a rat. \n
The Royal Court has now decreed \n
that I shall pay for excess greed \n
by hanging from the castle's rafter \n
until I reach the life hereafter. \n
The King allowed me still to choose \n
a meal before I meet the noose, \n
but I requested my last wish \n
to be a different kind of dish. \n
I had in days before seen class \n
in what is called a horse's ass. \n
The sister of the mentioned King \n
was sooo obese, but she could sing. \n
In charge of entertainment, she \n
had, early on, laid eyes on me. \n
All servants to the Royals knew \n
that Kunigunde was a true \n
and loyal woman, only that \n
she found no man due to her fat. \n
The King felt sorry for his sis' \n
and sensed the need for her to kiss, \n
before the ravages of age \n
would end her work up on the stage. \n
But gold and silver had not found \n
a husband for this very round \n
and somewhat bald and homely girl. \n
Just last July, a British Earl \n
had turned away in true disgust, \n
'a detriment to British lust! ' \n
She came with riches and a castle \n
but he declined, it was a hassle. \n
I saw my last and final chance \n
and asked for a slow Polka dance, \n
my wish was granted by the sister \n
and notarised by the Philister. \n
The sun had set behind the trees, \n
I slowly rose with wobbly knees, \n
and then proceeded with my plan, \n
the brainchild of a desperate man. \n
The music filled the dancing hall \n
we moved with grace, from wall to wall. \n
Her garlic breath surrounded us \n
she pirouetted like a bus. \n
And then, she sang a Polka Rap \n
as through a huge incisor gap \n
came, soothingly, some lovely tones \n
accompanied by........ pheromones. \n
Soon found myself drawn to her breasts \n
which overflowed, up at the crest \n
of her pink gown of bright chiffon, \n
the time had come, she turned me on. \n
We danced and let the evening linger \n
the King was shown her middle finger, \n
her hand had grabbed me by the butt \n
and, all in all, the scene was hot. \n
The Minnesanger had arrived, \n
my plan, which could be called contrived, \n
was going well, as i had hoped. \n
She whispered 'what if we eloped? ' \n
And, with the blessing of the King \n
I did install a five-inch ring \n
on my new bride and royal saviour. \n
The pardon was for good behaviour. \n
And if you ever face your death \n
you must get used to garlic breath. \n
As well as each unusual trait \n
what matters is your mental state. \n
Dedicated to Au Canada. \n<|endoftext|>

"SISTER, sister, go to bed! \n
Go and rest your weary head." \n
Thus the prudent brother said. \n
"Do you want a battered hide, \n
Or scratches to your face applied?" \n
Thus his sister calm replied. \n
"Sister, do not raise my wrath. \n
I'd make you into mutton broth \n
As easily as kill a moth" \n
The sister raised her beaming eye \n
And looked on him indignantly \n
And sternly answered, "Only try!" \n
Off to the cook he quickly ran. \n
"Dear Cook, please lend a frying-pan \n
To me as quickly as you can." \n
And wherefore should I lend it you?" \n
"The reason, Cook, is plain to view. \n
I wish to make an Irish stew." \n
"What meat is in that stew to go?" \n
"My sister'll be the contents!" \n
"Oh" \n
"You'll lend the pan to me, Cook?" \n
"No!" \n

Oh! Mary, it's a shocking sight \n
To see an angry child. \n
I can't imagine, for my part, \n
The reason for your folly; \n
She did not do you any hurt \n
By playing with your dolly. \n
See, see, the little tears that run \n
Fast from her watery eye: \n
Come, my sweet innocent, have done, \n
'Twill do no good to cry. \n

Abuse \n
He was little at the time, \n
She was only a child, \n
But both were abused, \n
And had been for a while. \n
Their father was cruel, \n
Mean and heartless. \n
The way he hurt them, \n
Made it look effortless. \n
He locked her up, \n
In a room up the stair. \n
And left the house drunk, \n
Leaving her there. \n
He was hit from the mum, \n
A blow to the face. \n
The way they were treated, \n
Was an utter disgrace. \n
He couldn't get up, \n
He couldn't fight back. \n
For food to get stronger, \n
Was something he lacked. \n
The little girl was left, \n
Alone in the dark. \n
Cradling her arm, \n
On which was a mark. \n
Her wrist had been used, \n
To put out a cigarette stump. \n
Buring through the skin, \n
Leaving her with a lump. \n
He had been kicked, \n
When he was down. \n
Kicked for just being there, \n
Kicked down to the ground. \n
She had been someone, \n
For her parents alone, \n
To personally hurt, \n
When they were at home. \n
These children were hurt, \n
Outside and in. \n
They'd been physically abused, \n
And hurt right within. \n
Their pride had been banished, \n
Long, long ago. \n
They couldn't stand up, \n
And simply say, 'No! ' \n
The children died, \n
Not older than three. \n
The boy protecting his sister, \n
The girl clutching her teddy. \n
They had bruises, \n
Up and down their arms. \n
But they had escaped, \n
Escaped from further harm. \n
I wish that I could have, \n
Had the courage to speak. \n
To tell someone of this abuse, \n
That happened each week. \n
I could have made a difference, \n
For this little boy and girl, \n
I could have made a difference, \n
That they could mean the whole world. \n
So if you know of any, \n
Type of abuse. \n
Tell the helpline to today, \n
Before someones life is what we loose. \n<|endoftext|>

'When I received that love which is a face, \n
When I perceived that face which is a love, \n
Two voices, like those two old nations, strove \n
Within my heart, and the first-born gave place \n
And served the younger. 'Ah this golden space \n
Doth cage the airy pinions of my dove! \n
And ah this value, which might prove and more \n
Another love, seems simony to the grace \n
Of ours!' Thus while one passion doth protest, \n
The other cries: 'I care not how it be! \n
For, givest thou much or little, worst or best, \n

And may she know no Grief but in the name. \n
May his and her Pleasure and Love be so \n

Whose Love is strongest, or whose Bliss is most. \n

And may they count the hours as they pass, \n
By their own Joys, and not by Sun or Glass: \n
While every day like this may Sacred prove \n
To Friendship, Gratitude, and Strictest Love. \n<|endoftext|>
sister \n
I went toa Catholic school named St. Florian High School. \n
The school was under the authority of the Felician Nuns. \n
All the nuns carried the same middle name, Mary. \n
It was educational and certainly with a certain amount of fun, \n
But not as much fun the LaFave gave someone, \n
Who was the age of fourteen; \n
Do you know what I mean? \n
“It’s been fourteen days since I don’t know when, \n
When I saw her with my best friend” \n
Sorry, I went off on a tangent, \n
-not that I would think of ever having sex with a nun, \n
I would do “nun” of that. \n
Especially the above aforementioned, \n
I would often wonder what it is like to have decent “lay” teacher, \n
The teachers who were raping their students statutorily, \n
Were in big trouble, \n
Spread by all the media, they condemned editorially, \n
Many a male student would have wanted LaFave to burst their virgin bubble. \n
Pamela Rogers, Rebecca Ann Boicelli, Mary Kay Letourneau, Celeste Emerick, \n
Adrianne Hockett, Carol Lynn Flannigan, Amber Denise Williams, Senorita Walker, Kristen Margrif, Amber Marshall, Sarah Bench-Salorio, Melissa Michelle Deel, Angela Comer, Nicole Andrea Barnhart, Tammy Lee Huggins, Toni Lynn Woods, Bethany Sherrill, Margaret De Barraicua, Nicole Long, Rachel Holt, Sharon Linton Rutherford, Susan Lemery, Becci Hill, Wendie A. Schweikert, Allena Ward, Jennifer Mally, Mariella Brenlla, Karen Robbins, Christina Butler, and Kelsey Peterson are among the convicted. \n
They betrayed the society that has entrusted them with the education of children, \n
After looking at these mug shots I find it hard, \n
That anyone would have sexual desire for them, \n
What is that the students would get better grade, not fail, \n
Or simply screw someone that was willing and able? \n
What more is that I discovered not just rape, but murder, and kidnapping? \n
But I hope that these indiscretions were just whim, neither for fame nor glory. \n
So back to St. Florian High, \n
I’m glad that I haven’t put up with that BS when I went to school, \n
So the nuns are exonerated, but the pedophile priests, \n
- they are a different story. \n
(12-5-2007) \n
And it still continues, \n
A 33 female year old teacher was convicted of raping two brothers in the news, \n
Jennifer Rice had sex with a ten year old and a fifteen year old, \n
Yet this story is not ending, the end is not in sight, many more to unfold. \n

This poem goes out to Mr. Peter \n
Who is a friend of my sister \n
And blow out my cover \n
In order to hide \n

And Mr. Peter who is a genius \n
Discovered my disguise \n
And ruined my surprise. \n

sister \n
She always likes to annoy me \n
And says I am very sweet \n
She keeps giving me kisses \n
Which I don’t think is neat \n
We have these huge fights \n
Be the topic something real or a dream \n
Fiza hits me so hard \n
That I shout and scream \n
I think during one such fight \n
I broke a bone or two \n
My mom to stop us fighting \n
Yells at us both, that’s all she can do \n
She makes an angelic face \n
When my parents are around \n
But when we are fighting \n
She is the other way around \n
With that angelic face \n
She gets my parent’s affection \n
And even though I am innocent \n
I have to bear the imposition \n
Mom scares me out of my wits \n
Even though all she does is scold \n
If she scold me for the tiniest things \n
Before mom, I still can’t be bold \n
It’s a fact that we always fight \n
And she tries to eat my pizza \n
I still have to admit \n
I love my sister……….Fiza \n<|endoftext|>
sister \n
The strong-girl of our home! \n
She did the hardest chores; \n
And helped mother at work, \n
And locked the house’s doors. \n
She was a simple dame; \n
But received all the blame; \n
She yearned for love and name; \n
Life played a cruel game! \n
She loved to talk her heart, \n
And learned on own some art; \n
Unlucky on her part, \n
She remains right from start. \n
She is an Aquarian; \n
Devoted Marian; \n
She leads a spinster’s life, \n
Alone, amidst much strife. \n
May God bless my sister, \n
On her birthday today! \n
And grant her will-power \n
To walk in Heaven’s way. \n

sister \n
It is the first mild day of March: \n
Each minute sweeter than before \n
The redbreast sings from the tall larch \n
That stands beside our door. \n
There is a blessing in the air, \n
Which seems a sense of joy to yield \n
To the bare trees, and mountains bare, \n
And grass in the green field. \n
My sister! ('tis a wish of mine) \n
Now that our morning meal is done, \n
Make haste, your morning task resign; \n
Come forth and feel the sun. \n
Edward will come with you;--and, pray, \n
Put on with speed your woodland dress; \n
And bring no book: for this one day \n
We'll give to idleness. \n
No joyless forms shall regulate \n
Our living calendar: \n
We from to-day, my Friend, will date \n
The opening of the year. \n
Love, now a universal birth, \n
From heart to heart is stealing, \n
From earth to man, from man to earth: \n
--It is the hour of feeling. \n
One moment now may give us more \n
Than years of toiling reason: \n
Our minds shall drink at every pore \n
The spirit of the season. \n
Some silent laws our hearts will make, \n
Which they shall long obey: \n
We for the year to come may take \n
Our temper from to-day. \n
And from the blessed power that rolls \n
About, below, above, \n
We'll frame the measure of our souls: \n
They shall be tuned to love. \n
Then come, my Sister! come, I pray, \n
With speed put on your woodland dress; \n
And bring no book: for this one day \n
We'll give to idleness. \n<|endoftext|>

I'm glad I have a sister \n
and happy you're the one \n
that fills my life with laughter, \n
happiness and fun. \n
I love the little secrets \n
and jokes that no one knows \n
except for us two funnies \n
Oh it makes me laugh! \n
Oh the fun we have together, \n
It makes my life all better. \n
You're there when I need a hug, \n
i feel snug as a bug in a rug! \n
All you do is smile \n
and it brightens up the room, \n
Whenever you're away, \n
I know you'll be home soon. \n
We talk of getting older \n
and going to the gym, \n
growing up, getting married \n
and of course we're having kids! \n
I'll be there when you need me, \n
and I hope you'll do the same, \n
ring me and I'll be there \n
as quickly as I can. \n
We laugh at all the memories, \n
we grin at all the names, \n
even though we change, \n
I hope our friendship stays the same. \n
I love our little chats \n
and dreams of our life, \n
and I know that one day \n
you'll make a great mother and wife! \n
We are two emotional sisters, \n
that we imagine to be, \n
we even have our ups and downs but that comes naturally. \n
So even when we are apart, \n
you have a place inside my heart! \n
Sisters together forever at heart \n
Even when death do us part. \n<|endoftext|>

Sister, my sister \n
Why is it that you speak so loud? \n
Is it your way to be noticed? \n
Or your way to make yourself count? \n
Tell me sister, who will listen? \n
Who will see? \n
The words coming out of your mouth \n
are only those of hatred and bitterness \n
turning the beautiful sight of you into an ugly one \n
Why my sister \n
Is it that you don’t care? \n
Is it your arrogance \n
That you appearently seem to think is fine? \n
Is it your ignorance \n
Which is obvious when you say those stupid things \n
Or is it just you being self-centered \n
Thinking that’s what the worlds looking for? \n
No, my lovely sister \n
Is that really all there’s to know about you? \n
Is that all you have to give? \n
I know better \n
You know better and guess what \n
The world knows better \n
So lift yourself up sister \n
And finally be proud of the queen you truely are! \n

rose \n
To sighs of morning air, that froze,- \n
(With her lips opened for a say), \n
How curiously has smiled the rose \n
On a September fleeting day! \n
And how has she ever dared \n
To greet, with air of springy queens, \n
The single blue-tit, in the bare \n
Shrubs fleshing in the orb of wings; \n
To bloom with steadfast dream that later, \n
Just leaving her cold bed in rest, \n
She’ll cling, the last and dissipated, \n
To a young hostess’s charming breast! \n<|endoftext|>

SWEET PICTURE of Life's chequer'd hour! \n
Ah, wherefore droop thy blushing head? \n
Tell me, oh tell me, hap'less flow'r, \n
Is it because thy charms are fled? \n
Come, gentle ROSE, and learn from me \n
A lesson of Philosophy. \n
Thy scented buds, LIFE'S joys disclose; \n
They strew our paths with magic sweets; \n
Where many a thorn like thine, fair ROSE, \n
Full oft the weary wand'rer meets; \n
And when he sees thy charms depart, \n
He feels thy thorn within his heart. \n
When Morn's bright torch illum'd the sky, \n
Vainly thy flaunting buds display'd \n
Enamell'd leaves of crimson die, \n
Ill-fated blossoms doom'd to fade; \n
So 'tis with BEAUTY, hapless flow'r, \n
Its lustre blooms but for an hour. \n
Come blushing ROSE, and on my breast \n
Recline thy gentle head, and die; \n
Thy scatter'd leaves shall there be press'd, \n
Bath'd with a tear from PITY'S eye; \n
There shall thy balmy sweets impart \n
An essence grateful to my heart. \n
Thus SYMPATHY, with lenient pow'r, \n
Shall bid thy fading charms bestow \n
Soft odours for life's happy hour, \n
Kind, healing balsam for its woe! \n
If such thy virtues, ROSE DIVINE! \n
OH ! MAY THY ENVIED FATE BE MINE. \n<|endoftext|>
rose \n
The Rose was sick, and smiling died; \n
And, being to be sanctified, \n
About the bed, there sighing stood \n
The sweet and flowery sisterhood. \n
Some hung the head, while some did bring, \n
To wash her, water from the spring; \n
Some laid her forth, while others wept, \n
But all a solemn fast there kept. \n
The holy sisters some among, \n
The sacred dirge and trental sung; \n
But ah! what sweets smelt everywhere, \n
As heaven had spent all perfumes there! \n
At last, when prayers for the dead, \n
And rites, were all accomplished, \n
They, weeping, spread a lawny loom, \n
And closed her up as in a tomb. \n<|endoftext|>

If you were a rose? \n
"If I were a rose and you were a bee, \n

I should close my leaves and keep you fast, \n
If you were a bee." \n<|endoftext|>
rose \n
'O WHICH is the last rose?' \n
A blossom of no name. \n
At midnight the snow came; \n
At daybreak a vast rose, \n
In darkness unfurl'd, \n
O'er-petall'd the world. \n
Its odourless pallor \n
Blossom'd forlorn, \n
Till radiant valour \n
Establish'd the morn-- \n
Till the night \n
Was undone \n
In her fight \n
With the sun. \n
The brave orb in state rose, \n
And crimson he shone first; \n
While from the high vine \n
Of heaven the dawn burst, \n
Staining the great rose \n
From sky-line to sky-line. \n
The red rose of morn \n
A white rose at noon turn'd; \n
But at sunset reborn \n
All red again soon burn'd. \n
Then the pale rose of noonday \n
Rebloom'd in the night, \n
And spectrally white \n
In the light \n
Of the moon lay. \n
But the vast rose \n
Was scentless, \n
And this is the reason: \n
When the blast rose \n
Relentless, \n
And brought in due season \n
The snow rose, the last rose \n
Congeal'd in its breath, \n
Then came with it treason; \n
The traitor was Death. \n
In lee-valleys crowded, \n
The sheep and the birds \n
Were frozen and shrouded \n
In flights and in herds. \n
In highways \n
And byways \n
The young and the old \n
Were tortured and madden'd \n
And kill'd by the cold. \n
But many were gladden'd \n
By the beautiful last rose, \n
The blossom of no name \n
That came when the snow came, \n
In darkness unfurl'd-- \n
The wonderful vast rose \n
That fill'd all the world. \n<|endoftext|>

It doesn’t matter what have gone \n
The rose will wait for the dawn \n
The spring no more helps the friend \n
His beauty will shatter like wall of sand \n
His days of life will end very soon \n
At morn, at noon or after noon \n
The rose sees autumn in the spring \n
A wave of sorrow his end will bring \n
The red rose weeps and weeps more \n
Upon these tears his eyes will sore \n
No spring can stop, no joy can amaze \n
With each passing moment his death he chase \n
So times are when autumn comes in spring \n
No joy can touch you no nerve can sing \n

rose \n
Consider \n
a girl who keeps slipping off, \n
arms limp as old carrots, \n
into the hypnotist's trance, \n
into a spirit world \n
speaking with the gift of tongues. \n
She is stuck in the time machine, \n
suddenly two years old sucking her thumb, \n
as inward as a snail, \n
learning to talk again. \n
She's on a voyage. \n
She is swimming further and further back, \n
up like a salmon, \n
struggling into her mother's pocketbook. \n
Little doll child, \n
come here to Papa. \n
Sit on my knee. \n
I have kisses for the back of your neck. \n
A penny for your thoughts, Princess. \n
I will hunt them like an emerald. \n
Come be my snooky \n
and I will give you a root. \n
That kind of voyage, \n
rank as a honeysuckle. \n
Once \n
a king had a christening \n
for his daughter Briar Rose \n
and because he had only twelve gold plates \n
he asked only twelve fairies \n
to the grand event. \n
The thirteenth fairy, \n
her fingers as long and thing as straws, \n
her eyes burnt by cigarettes, \n
her uterus an empty teacup, \n
arrived with an evil gift. \n
She made this prophecy: \n
The princess shall prick herself \n
on a spinning wheel in her fifteenth year \n
and then fall down dead. \n
Kaputt! \n
The court fell silent. \n
The king looked like Munch's Scream \n
Fairies' prophecies, \n
in times like those, \n
held water. \n
However the twelfth fairy \n
had a certain kind of eraser \n
and thus she mitigated the curse \n
changing that death \n
into a hundred-year sleep. \n
The king ordered every spinning wheel \n
exterminated and exorcised. \n
Briar Rose grew to be a goddess \n
and each night the king \n
bit the hem of her gown \n
to keep her safe. \n
He fastened the moon up \n
with a safety pin \n
to give her perpetual light \n
He forced every male in the court \n
to scour his tongue with Bab-o \n
lest they poison the air she dwelt in. \n
Thus she dwelt in his odor. \n
Rank as honeysuckle. \n
On her fifteenth birthday \n
she pricked her finger \n
on a charred spinning wheel \n
and the clocks stopped. \n
Yes indeed. She went to sleep. \n
The king and queen went to sleep, \n
the courtiers, the flies on the wall. \n
The fire in the hearth grew still \n
and the roast meat stopped crackling. \n
The trees turned into metal \n
and the dog became china. \n
They all lay in a trance, \n
each a catatonic \n
stuck in a time machine. \n
Even the frogs were zombies. \n
Only a bunch of briar roses grew \n
forming a great wall of tacks \n
around the castle. \n
Many princes \n
tried to get through the brambles \n
for they had heard much of Briar Rose \n
but they had not scoured their tongues \n
so they were held by the thorns \n
and thus were crucified. \n
In due time \n
a hundred years passed \n
and a prince got through. \n
The briars parted as if for Moses \n
and the prince found the tableau intact. \n
He kissed Briar Rose \n
and she woke up crying: \n
Daddy! Daddy! \n
Presto! She's out of prison! \n
She married the prince \n
and all went well \n
except for the fear - \n
the fear of sleep. \n
Briar Rose \n
was an insomniac... \n
She could not nap \n
or lie in sleep \n
without the court chemist \n
mixing her some knock-out drops \n
and never in the prince's presence. \n
If if is to come, she said, \n
sleep must take me unawares \n
while I am laughing or dancing \n
so that I do not know that brutal place \n
where I lie down with cattle prods, \n
the hole in my cheek open. \n
Further, I must not dream \n
for when I do I see the table set \n
and a faltering crone at my place, \n
her eyes burnt by cigarettes \n
as she eats betrayal like a slice of meat. \n
I must not sleep \n
for while I'm asleep I'm ninety \n
and think I'm dying. \n
Death rattles in my throat \n
like a marble. \n
I wear tubes like earrings. \n
I lie as still as a bar of iron. \n
You can stick a needle \n
through my kneecap and I won't flinch. \n
I'm all shot up with Novocain. \n
This trance girl \n
is yours to do with. \n
You could lay her in a grave, \n
an awful package, \n
and shovel dirt on her face \n
and she'd never call back: Hello there! \n
But if you kissed her on the mouth \n
her eyes would spring open \n

Presto! \n
She's out of prison. \n
There was a theft. \n
That much I am told. \n
I was abandoned. \n
That much I know. \n
I was forced backward. \n
I was forced forward. \n
I was passed hand to hand \n

Each night I am nailed into place \n
and forget who I am. \n
Daddy? \n
That's another kind of prison. \n
It's not the prince at all, \n

drunkeningly bends over my bed, \n
circling the abyss like a shark, \n
my father thick upon me \n
like some sleeping jellyfish. \n
What voyage is this, little girl? \n
This coming out of prison? \n

rose \n
If you have seen a richer glow, \n
Pray, tell me where your roses blow! \n
Look! coral-leaved! and -- mark these spots \n
Red staining red in crimson clots, \n
Like a sweet lip bitten through \n
In a pique. There, where that hue \n
Is spilt in drops, some fairy thing \n
Hath gashed the azure of its wing, \n
Or thence, perhaps, this very morn, \n
Plucked the splinters of a thorn. \n
Rose! I make thy bliss my care! \n
In my lady's dusky hair \n
Thou shalt burn this coming night, \n
With even a richer crimson light. \n
To requite me thou shalt tell -- \n
What I might not say as well -- \n
How I love her; how, in brief, \n
On a certain crimson leaf \n
In my bosom, is a debt \n
Writ in deeper crimson yet. \n
If she wonder what it be -- \n
But she'll guess it, I foresee -- \n
Tell her that I date it, pray, \n
From the first sweet night in May. \n<|endoftext|>
rose \n
He \n
Fill your bowl with roses: the bowl, too, have of crystal. \n
Sit at the western window. Take the sun \n
Between your hands like a ball of flaming crystal, \n
Poise it to let it fall, but hold it still, \n
And meditate on the beauty of your existence; \n
The beauty of this, that you exist at all. \n
She \n
The sun goes down, -- but without lamentation. \n
I close my eyes, and the stream of my sensation \n
In this, at least, grows clear to me: \n
Beauty is a word that has no meaning. \n
Beauty is naught to me. \n
He \n
The last blurred raindrops fall from the half-clear sky, \n
Eddying lightly, rose-tinged, in the windless wake of the sun. \n
The swallow ascending against cold waves of cloud \n
Seems winging upward over huge bleak stairs of stone. \n
The raindrop finds its way to the heart of the leaf-bud. \n
But no word finds its way to the heart of you. \n
She \n
This also is clear in the stream of my sensation: \n
That I am content, for the moment, Let me be. \n
How light the new grass looks with the rain-dust on it! \n
But heart is a word that has no meaning, \n
Heart means nothing to me. \n
He \n
To the end of the world I pass and back again \n
In flights of the mind; yet always find you here, \n
Remote, pale, unattached . . . O Circe-too-clear-eyed, \n
Watching amused your fawning tiger-thoughts, \n
Your wolves, your grotesque apes -- relent, relent! \n
Be less wary for once: it is the evening. \n
She \n
But if I close my eyes what howlings greet me! \n
Do not persuade. Be tranquil. Here is flesh \n
With all its demons. Take it, sate yourself. \n
But leave my thoughts to me. \n<|endoftext|>

All tenderly his messenger he chose; \n
Deep-hearted, pure, with scented dew still wet - \n
One perfect rose. \n

'My fragile leaves,' it said, 'his heart enclose.' \n
Love long has taken for his amulet \n
One perfect rose. \n

One perfect limousine, do you suppose? \n
Ah no, it's always just my luck to get \n

After the movie, when the lights come up, \n
He takes her powdered hand behind the wings; \n
She, all in yellow, like a buttercup, \n
Lifts her white face, yearns up to him, and clings; \n
And with a silent, gliding step they move \n
Over the footlights, in familiar glare, \n
Panther-like in the Tango whirl of love, \n
He fawning close on her with idiot stare. \n
Swiftly they cross the stage. O lyric ease! \n
The drunken music follows the sure feet, \n
The swaying elbows, intergliding knees, \n
Moving with slow precision on the beat. \n
She was a waitress in a restaurant, \n
He picked her up and taught her how to dance. \n
She feels his arms, lifts an appealing glance, \n
But knows he spent last evening with Zudora; \n
And knows that certain changes are before her. \n
The brilliant spotlight circles them around, \n
Flashing the spangles on her weighted dress. \n
He mimics wooing her, without a sound, \n
Flatters her with a smoothly smiled caress. \n
He fears that she will someday queer his act; \n
Feeling his anger. He will quit her soon. \n
He nods for faster music. He will contract \n
Another partner, under another moon. \n
Meanwhile, 'smooth stuff.' He lets his dry eyes flit \n
Over the yellow faces there below; \n
Maybe he'll cut down on his drinks a bit, \n
Not to annoy her, and spoil the show. . . \n
Zudora, waiting for her turn to come, \n
Watches them from the wings and fatly leers \n
At the girl's younger face, so white and dumb, \n
And the fixed, anguished eyes, ready for tears. \n
She lies beside him, with a false wedding-ring, \n
In a cheap room, with moonlight on the floor; \n
The moonlit curtains remind her much of spring, \n
Of a spring evening on the Coney shore. \n
And while he sleeps, knowing she ought to hate, \n
She still clings to the lover that she knew,-- \n
The one that, with a pencil on a plate, \n
Drew a heart and wrote, 'I'd die for you.' \n<|endoftext|>

ALL things uncomely and broken, all things worn out and old, \n
The cry of a child by the roadway, the creak of a lumbering cart, \n
The heavy steps of the ploughman, splashing the wintry mould, \n
Are wronging your image that blossoms a rose in the deeps of my heart. \n
The wrong of unshapely things is a wrong too great to be told; \n
I hunger to build them anew and sit on a green knoll apart, \n

Each time my Childish eye \n
Fixed full, and steady, on his own \n
In Childish honesty— \n
And told him what I'd like, today, \n

The mingled side \n

And often since, in Danger, \n
I count the force 'twould be \n

A wonderful joy our eyes to bless, \n
In her magnificent comeliness, \n
Is an English girl of eleven stone two, \n
And five foot ten in her dancing shoe! \n
She follows the hounds, and on she pounds - \n
The "field" tails off and the muffs diminish - \n
Over the hedges and brooks she bounds - \n
Straight as a crow, from find to finish. \n
At cricket, her kin will lose or win - \n
She and her maids, on grass and clover, \n
Eleven maids out - eleven maids in - \n
(And perhaps an occasional "maiden over"). \n
Go search the world and search the sea, \n
Then come you home and sing with me \n
There's no such gold and no such pearl \n
As a bright and beautiful English girl! \n
With a ten-mile spin she stretches her limbs, \n
She golfs, she punts, she rows, she swims - \n
She plays, she sings, she dances, too, \n
From ten or eleven till all is blue! \n
At ball or drum, till small hours come \n
(Chaperon's fan conceals her yawning), \n
She'll waltz away like a teetotum, \n
And never go home till daylight's dawning. \n
Lawn tennis may share her favours fair - \n
Her eyes a-dance and her cheeks a-glowing - \n
Down comes her hair, but what does she care? \n
It's all her own and it's worth the showing! \n
Go search the world and search the sea, \n
Then come you home and sing with me \n
There's no such gold and no such pearl \n
As a bright and beautiful English girl! \n
Her soul is sweet as the ocean air, \n
For prudery knows no haven there; \n
To find mock-modesty, please apply \n
To the conscious blush and the downcast eye. \n
Rich in the things contentment brings, \n
In every pure enjoyment wealthy, \n
Blithe as a beautiful bird she sings, \n
For body and mind are hale and healthy. \n
Her eyes they thrill with right goodwill - \n
Her heart is light as a floating feather - \n
As pure and bright as the mountain rill \n
That leaps and laughs in the Highland heather! \n
Go search the world and search the sea, \n
Then come you home and sing with me \n
There's no such gold and no such pearl \n

girl \n
Listen, and when thy hand this paper presses, \n
O time-worn woman, think of her who blesses \n
What thy thin fingers touch, with her caresses. \n
O mother, for the weight of years that break thee! \n
O daughter, for slow time must yet awake thee, \n
And from the changes of my heart must make thee! \n
O fainting traveller, morn is gray in heaven. \n
Dost thou remember how the clouds were driven? \n
And are they calm about the fall of even? \n
Pause near the ending of thy long migration; \n
For this one sudden hour of desolation \n
Appeals to one hour of thy meditation. \n
Suffer, O silent one, that I remind thee \n
Of the great hills that stormed the sky behind thee, \n
Of the wild winds of power that have resigned thee. \n
Know that the mournful plain where thou must wander \n
Is but a gray and silent world, but ponder \n
The misty mountains of the morning yonder. \n
Listen:-the mountain winds with rain were fretting, \n
And sudden gleams the mountain-tops besetting. \n
I cannot let thee fade to death, forgetting. \n
What part of this wild heart of mine I know not \n
Will follow with thee where the great winds blow not, \n
And where the young flowers of the mountain grow not. \n
Yet let my letter with thy lost thoughts in it \n
Tell what the way was when thou didst begin it, \n
And win with thee the goal when thou shalt win it. \n
I have not writ this letter of divining \n
To make a glory of thy silent pining, \n
A triumph of thy mute and strange declining. \n
Only one youth, and the bright life was shrouded; \n
Only one morning, and the day was clouded; \n
And one old age with all regrets is crowded. \n
O hush, O hush! Thy tears my words are steeping. \n
O hush, hush, hush! So full, the fount of weeping? \n
Poor eyes, so quickly moved, so near to sleeping? \n
Pardon the girl; such strange desires beset her. \n
Poor woman, lay aside the mournful letter \n
That breaks thy heart; the one who wrote, forget her: \n
The one who now thy faded features guesses, \n
With filial fingers thy gray hair caresses, \n
With morning tears thy mournful twilight blesses. \n<|endoftext|>

Varus drags me into his affairs \n
out of the Forum, where I’m seen idling: \n
to a little whore I immediately saw, \n
not very inelegant, not unattractive, \n
who, when we came there, met us \n
with varied chatter, including, how might \n
Bithynia stand now, what’s it like, and where \n
might the benefit have been to me in cash. \n
I told her what’s true, nothing at all, \n
while neither the praetors nor their aides, \n
return any the richer, especially since \n
our Praetor, Memmius, the bugger, \n
cared not a jot for his followers. \n
‘But surely,’ they said, you could have bought \n
slaves they say are made for the litter there.’ \n
I, so the girl might take me to be wealthy, \n
said ‘no, for me things weren’t so bad, \n
that coming across one bad province, \n
I couldn’t buy eight good men.’ \n
But I’d no one, neither here nor there, \n
who might even raise to his shoulder \n
the shattered foot of an old couch. \n
At this she, like the shameless thing she was, said \n
‘I beg you, my dear Catullus, for the loan of them, \n
just for a while: I’d like to be carried \n
to Serap’s temple.’ ‘Wait’ I said to the girl, \n
‘what I just said was mine, isn’t actually in \n
my possession: my friend Cinna, that’s Gaius, \n
purchased the thing for himself. \n
Whether they’re his or mine, what difference to me? \n
I use them just as well as if I’d bought them myself. \n
But you are quite tasteless, and annoying, \n
you with whom no inexactness is allowed.’ \n<|endoftext|>

Dark was the dawn, and o'er the deep \n
The boist'rous whirlwinds blew; \n
The Sea-bird wheel'd its circling sweep, \n
And all was drear to view-- \n
When on the beach that binds the western shore \n
The love-lorn ZELMA stood, list'ning the tempest's roar. \n
II. \n
Her eager Eyes beheld the main, \n
While on her DRACO dear \n
She madly call'd, but call'd in vain, \n
No sound could DRACO hear, \n
Save the shrill yelling of the fateful blast, \n
While ev'ry Seaman's heart, quick shudder'd as it past. \n

White were the billows, wide display'd \n
The clouds were black and low; \n
The Bittern shriek'd, a gliding shade \n
Seem'd o'er the waves to go ! \n
The livid flash illum'd the clam'rous main, \n
While ZELMA pour'd, unmark'd, her melancholy strain. \n

"Be still!" she cried, "loud tempest cease! \n

"Then wherefore let the suff'ring Negro's breast \n
"Bow to his fellow, MAN, in brighter colours drest. \n
VIII. \n
"Is it the dim and glossy hue \n
"That marks him for despair?-- \n
"While men with blood their hands embrue, \n
"And mock the wretch's pray'r? \n
"Shall guiltless Slaves the Scourge of tyrants feel, \n
"And, e'en before their GOD ! unheard, unpitied kneel. \n
IX. \n
"Could the proud rulers of the land \n
"Our Sable race behold; \n

"Why seek to mock the Ethiop's face? \n
"Why goad our hapless kind? \n

"Is there no kindred mind? \n
"Does not the cheek which vaunts the roseate hue \n
"Oft blush for crimes, that Ethiops never knew? \n
XI. \n
"Behold ! the angry waves conspire \n
"To check the barb'rous toil! \n
"While wounded Nature's vengeful ire-- \n
"Roars, round this trembling Isle! \n
"And hark ! her voice re-echoes in the wind-- \n

"The letter'd page to trace;-- \n

Long, on the swelling surge sustain'd \n
Brave DRACO sought the shore, \n
Watch'd the dark Maid, but ne'er complain'd, \n
Then sunk, to gaze no more! \n
Poor ZELMA saw him buried by the wave-- \n
And, with her heart's true Love, plung'd in a wat'ry grave. \n<|endoftext|>

There's no plastic surgery to alter your soul \n

a place where the angels gather to sing \n

for in this kingdom of happiness and joy \n

he gave up his life so that we could see \n
what it is to be set free. \n
of all the suffering that we must go through \n

loss \n
It had been a long passing away. \n
A death that crackles the hardest stone, \n
He sank into the bed of this bay, \n
A death silent and alone. \n
He once frolicked through the sleepy field \n
Waking the insects on the grass. \n
Bare-foot, to the seashore yield \n
To dance with a moonlit lass. \n
He was my child, my dear, \n
Who never let it pass him by, \n
Always sat at the edge of that pier, \n
Watching the Samurai sunset sky. \n
Now I stand here over his grave, \n
Now realising he is dead. \n
And there are fireflies over the wave, \n
Spelling a poem left unsaid. \n
They wait for him, \n
Forever, \n
Thinking he's just asleep, \n
Waiting, waiting, \n
Thinking, \n
Soon, \n
He'll rise \n
From the ocean deep. \n<|endoftext|>

My chance to do something right. \n

The silent solace. \n

In the depths of the night, \n
As they stumble–in darkness, \n
They know not what is right; \n
Who has been here the longest? \n
Like a sigh–lost in a crowd, \n
Or the Last star in the sky, \n
Death is constant–absorbed \n
Into the ramblings of life. \n
In the midst of the darkness, \n
They aimlessly wander. \n
In searching–In pleading, \n
To find what is lost. \n
This sigh fades away \n
In the crowds growing murmur. \n
This star fades away \n
In Sol’s waking smile. \n
They grieve and they worry, \n
Looking for the light. \n
Instead they find wisdom, \n
and this wisdom is sight. \n<|endoftext|>

L'enfant chantait; la mère au lit, exténuée, \n
Agonisait, beau front dans l'ombre se penchant ; \n
La mort au-dessus d'elle errait dans la nuée ; \n
Et j'écoutais ce râle, et j'entendais ce chant. \n
L'enfant avait cinq ans, et près de la fenêtre \n
Ses rires et ses jeux faisaient un charmant bruit ; \n
Et la mère, à côté de ce pauvre doux être \n
Qui chantait tout le jour, toussait toute la nuit. \n
La mère alla dormir sous les dalles du cloître ; \n
Et le petit enfant se remit à chanter... \n
La douleur est un fruit ; Dieu ne le fait pas croître \n
Sur la branche trop faible encor pour le porter. \n
Childhood \n
The Child was singing, and the Mother lay \n
Stretched on the bed which pain and anguish throng, \n
Death's cloud fast closing on her parting day: \n
I heard her laboring breath, I heard the song. \n
The Child its gambols by the lattice plied; \n
Its sport, its laughter, sounded glad and bright; \n
And the poor Mother by her darling's side, \n
Who sang all day, coughed through the painful night. \n
The Mother sleeps the cloister's stones below; \n
The Child sings, heedless of its orphan state: \n
Grief is a fruit that God forbids to grow \n
On boughs too feeble to support its weight. \n<|endoftext|>

We were little girls \n
Living next door to one another \n
I was an only child \n
She had three younger brothers \n
We became close friends \n
We pedaled together on a bike ride \n
We liked singing with songs on the radio \n
We did our homework side by side \n
Skillfully we climbed an old fruit tree \n
And sat on branches with legs dangling \n
We’d snatch apples and eat them green… \n
Our throats were gripped by tart strangling \n
We were actresses without a written script \n
What a story our young minds could weave… \n
When our imaginations convincingly took over \n
the roles we played truly made us believe \n
Many years have passed since we kept company \n
We both grew older and went our separate ways \n

But- \n
also never imagined... \n

Felt immediately. \n
After the truckload of \n

There is no more time \n

''One day we'll take the kids there...''trips. \n
No more \n
''When we get the money we'll do this...''. \n
Broken promises \n
flooded my ears. \n
All I heard was my own voice \n
reassuring her that ''One day we'll....''. \n
The tears have dried over the past 3 weeks. \n
But the lesson learned \n
will stay forever. \n
I will not mourn \n

baited by tumbling flowing water \n
of garden hose patterned fountains \n
my Father makes beside the path above \n
grass to entice Tobbies aerial antics \n
somersaults all viewing smile must \n
delight in, like magic, Tobby appears \n
across paddock with elfin liquid speed \n
always seeming to know when Father \n
waters the vegetable garden with sixth \n
dog sense following nose on summer \n
days yesteryear breezes leaps small boys \n
also into a myriad of adventures running \n
in fleeting moccasin grasses like an Indian \n

childhood \n
soil soil and soil, , playing in the soil, \n
No fear of disease, no fear of toil. \n
What a wonderful days that was, \n
i always remember my childhood, my innocent childhood.. \n
Only friend no foes, \n
no thinking of what dont and what does. \n
No fear of future, no thinking of present, \n
i always remember my childhood, my innocent childhood.. \n
What was the past, leave it, it surpassed, \n
what has to happen, lets face when it comes. \n
Future planning! What is this? \n
i always remember my childhood, my innocent childhood.. \n
Play was religion and play was God, \n
only thing which gave fear, was my fathers rod. \n
Crying crying crying a lot, then said love you pappa, \n
i always remember my childhood, my innocent childhood.. \n<|endoftext|>

My childhood was fun, \n
tough and exciting. \n
My childhood was one \n
where there wasn't much fighting. \n
This was my childhood. \n
My childhood was filled \n
with family and friends. \n
My childhood was filled \n
with love that tied up loose ends. \n
This was my childhood. \n
My childhood came \n
with a grandmother that cared. \n
When she left me \n
I remembered all the times we shared. \n
This was my childhood. \n
My childhood was filled \n
with classwork and homework. \n
My childhood was filled \n
with parents who hated work. \n
This was my childhood. \n
My childhood was filled \n
with fun in the hood, \n
and food that tasted like Campbell's, \n
'Umm Umm Good! ' \n
This was my childhood. \n
My childhood was filled \n
with tricycles and bicycles. \n
My childhood was filled \n
with popsicles and Dill pickles. \n
This was my childhood. \n
My childhood was filled \n
with lots of happy holidays. \n
Holidays that aren't \n
just the same nowadays. \n
This was my childhood. \n
Now my childhood \n
has become nothing but memories, \n
But all the good times \n
will live on within me. \n

childhood \n
Childhood memories are often steeped in mystery. \n
The older we get the memories exclude \n
sometimes things we might find painful as we journeyed on. \n
I tried to visualise my childhood as a happy one, \n
though I know in my heart it was a very much lonely one. \n
Not only was I shy, but I never mixed very well. \n
I spent so much of my time nearly always on my own. \n
The only exciting time I can remember \n
was one summer I spent with friends of my father \n
whom I referred to as Aunt Elsie and Uncle Jim. \n
For the two months I spent with them \n
in a small town called Allison \n
hold some of the best memories of my childhood. \n
It was away from my parents \n
and into someone’s house that cared. \n
I went fishing every day \n
in the stream at the end of the garden, \n
made many friends \n
and had one of the most enjoyable times \n
of my childhood \n
that will always live within me. \n

childhood \n
Among the things enriching, \n
That helped to shape my life, \n
Was the county fair \n
With fond memories in rife. \n
October of each year, \n
The fair would come to town. \n
The rides were fun, and the air cool— \n
With temperatures way down. \n
Hotdog, soda, candy apple— \n
There was much to eat. \n
But popcorn and cotton candy \n
Were my favorite treats. \n
Neon signs. Booming music. \n
Electrifying atmosphere. \n
Rides. Zoo. And exhibits. \n
Haunted houses—if you'd dare. \n
Ferris wheel for the sedentary. \n
Roller coaster for the brave. \n
Merry-go-round for the toddler. \n
The bumper car was raved. \n
A chance to win stuffed animals, \n
Dinnerware, and all else. \n
Just play the game, and hit it right; \n
Then choose the prize yourself. \n
The crowds were huge and excited, \n
Folks from everywhere. \n
‘Twas hard to find a parking space \n
At the county fair. \n
Life can be so much fun, \n
In spite of everything else. \n
So, take time to smell the roses, \n
And enjoy yourself. \n<|endoftext|>

Childhood Is \n

ducking and diving \n

When he asked about my childhood \n
I knew not where to start. \n
The scents began to flood my head \n
while strangling my heart. \n
My mind has instant recall \n
on those certain horrid scents. \n
Like overflowing ashtrays \n
in a car with blowing vents. \n
The smell of all night parties \n
mixed with the scent of a strangers love. \n
The sour stench of sweat and tears \n
it's hard to rise above. \n
The pungent smell of beer breath \n
in a young girls sleeping face. \n
The memories of childhood \n
are not so easily erased. \n
Some things are burnt in memory \n
no matter how we fight. \n
He quietly put a scented candle \n
on the table in plain sight \n<|endoftext|>
childhood \n
Elbowing our way, we run. \n
Someone is being beaten up in the market. \n
You wouldn’t want to miss it! \n
We pick up speed, racing to the uproar, \n
scooping up water in our felt boots \n
and forgetting to wipe our sniffles. \n
And stood stock-still. In our little hearts something tightened, \n
when we saw how the ring of sheepskin coats, \n
fur coats, hooded coats, was contracting, \n
how he stood up near the green vegetable stall \n
with his head pulled into his shoulders from the hail \n
of jabs, kicks, spitting, slaps in the face. \n
Suddenly someone from the right by the handcart \n
pushed his teeth in, \n
Suddenly someone from the left bashed his forehead with a \n
chunk of ice. \n
Blood appeared-and then they started in, in earnest. \n
All piled up in a heap they began to scream together, \n
pounding with sticks, reins, \n
and linchpins out of wheels. \n
In vain he wheezed to them: 'Mates, \n
you’re my mates-what’s the matter? ' \n
The mob wanted to settle accounts fully. \n
The mob was deaf with rage. \n
The mob grumbled at those who weren’t putting their boots in, \n
and they trampled something that looked like a body \n
into the spring snow that was turning into mud. \n
They beat him up with relish. With ingenuity. Juicy. \n
I saw how skillfully and precisely \n
one man kept putting the boots in, \n
boots with greasy flaps on them, \n
right under the belt of the man who was down, \n
smothered in mud and dungy water. \n
Their owner, a guy with an honest enough mug, \n
very proud of his high principles, \n
was saying with each kick: 'Don’t try your tricks with us! ' \n
booting him deliberately, with the utmost conviction, \n
and, sweat pouring, with a red face, he jovially called to me: \n
'Come on, youngster, get in it! ' \n
I can’t remember-how many there were, making a din, \n
beating him up. \n
It may have been a hundred, it may have been more, \n
but I, just a boy, wept for shame. \n
And if a hundred are beating somebody up, \n
howling in a frenzy-even if for a good cause- \n
I will never make one hundred and one! \n

childhood \n
memories of childhood... \n
such a wonderful, hazy, warm feeling, \n
special memories, filled with love \n
come welling up, and send my senses reeling, \n
aromatic fragrance, wafting up from the kitchen, \n
aroma of my mothers cooking, \n
father getting ready for work, \n
how handome he is looking, \n
I'm ready for school., hair plaited, \n
clutch my little, sisters hand tightly \n
bags perched securely on our backs \n
and off we go, skipping lightly, \n
lessons and studies, dilligently done, \n
supervised by dad, but always fun, \n
carefree, happy times were those \n
one could do, what one chose.... \n
the familiar house, and the close kinship \n
so many friends, and closely knit friendship, \n
no cares, no worries, they were not for us, \n
only love and protection, and a special fuss, \n
what wonderful years I can never forget \n
a happy childhood is an important asset \n
and now we are grown........ \n
only memories are left.... \n
when we are feeling down, or nostalgic, \n
just go back to those magical years... \n
relive those times, that sparkling innocence, \n
that time, devoid of from doubt and fears \n
oh childhood...so quickly did you fly \n
your very memory makes us sigh... \n
and remember.and smile, and feel content \n
for the Godgiven wonderful years, so well spent... \n
oh childhood, I hope I have been a good mother, \n
what I learnt from you, I hope I have given another, \n
a treasure for my children, to recall, and to cherish \n
a treasure to revel in and sustain, when we perish. \n<|endoftext|>
childhood \n
I am glad I met you on the edge \n
Of your barbarous childhood \n
In what purity of pleasure \n
You danced alone like a peasant \n
For the stamping joy's own sake! \n
How, set in their sandy sockets, \n
Your clear, truthful, transparent eyes \n
Shone out of the black frozen landscape \n
Of those gray-clothed schoolboys! \n
How your shy hand offered \n
The total generosity \n
Of original unforewarned fearful trust, \n
In a world grown old in iron hatred! \n
I am glad to set down \n
The first and ultimate you, \n
Your inescapable soul. Although \n
It fade like a fading smile \n
Or light falling from faces \n
Which some grimmer preoccupation replaces. \n
This happens everywhere at every time: \n
Joy lacks the cause for joy, \n
Love the answering love, \n
And truth the objectless persistent loneliness, \n
As they grow older, \n
To become later what they were \n
In childhood earlier, \n
In a world of cheating compromise. \n
Childhood, its own flower, \n
Flushes from the grasses with no reason \n
Except the sky of that season. \n
But the grown desires need objects \n
And taste of these corrupts the tongue \n
And the natural need is scattered \n
In satisfactions which satisfy \n
A debased need. \n
Yet all prayers are on die side of \n
Giving strength to naturalness, \n
So I pray for nothing new, \n
I pray only, after such knowledge, \n
That you may have the strength to be you. \n
And I shall remember \n
You who, being younger, \n
Will probably forget. \n<|endoftext|>

A mother worries about the choices that her son may make. \n
She knows she has let him make decisions for his own sake. \n
As sirens scream, a mother sits in darkness choking back tears. \n
She prays that her boy is safe and calms her doubting fears. \n
At half past two, beams from headlights flood the driveway. \n
Relieved that he is home, she tiptoes to her bedroom right away. \n
She hears an urgent knocking and goes to turn on the porch light. \n
Patiently waiting at the door is a police officer; he is a somber sight. \n<|endoftext|>

I know the fear within you aches \n
It captivates your mind \n
But I know you have what it takes \n
Though you fear you're walking blind \n
But walking blinds a good thing \n
Walk by faith and not by sight \n
With faith you can conquer anything \n
But the void of faith is fright \n
Remember, you have nothing to fear \n
This battle is God's fight too \n
And He's never lost a fight, my dear \n
So why would he start with you? \n
Remember the Warrior you are \n
The leader of them all \n
God heard our war cries from afar \n
And now beside us he's fighting tall \n
God is with you now and tomorrow \n
And forever till forever's end \n
Please don't let life bring you sorrow \n
Because in God you've found a friend \n
Please listen to my words \n
Listen and hold them dear \n

Look not in my eyes, for fear \n
Thy mirror true the sight I see, \n

One the long nights through must lie \n
Spent in star-defeated sighs, \n
But why should you as well as I \n
Perish? gaze not in my eyes. \n
A Grecian lad, as I hear tell, \n
One that many loved in vain, \n
Looked into a forest well \n
And never looked away again. \n
There, when the turf in springtime flowers, \n
With downward eye and gazes sad, \n
Stands amid the glancing showers \n
A jonquil, not a Grecian lad. \n<|endoftext|>
fear \n
When life becomes a trembling world of fear, \n
you question every single move you make, \n
afraid your loving soul will disappear; \n
for danger looms, awaiting your mistake. \n
What hidden word will cause explosion's might \n
to back you in a corner of despair? \n
Your sole reprieve lies in the ebon night, \n
yet anger boils from pain he wouldn't spare. \n
Where love once dwelled resides a burning hate \n
as desperation's hand has gained control. \n
No longer viewed as your eternal mate; \n
to save yourself becomes the utmost goal. \n
Envisioning a pool of crimson red; \n
a knife within your hand; your fear is shed. \n<|endoftext|>
fear \n
Yes indeed, I'm going home one day very soon my dear friend, \n
My life on this earth is but a journey, it's definitely not the end. \n
Though there be wars and rumors of wars and all the earth be taken, \n
With my hope in The Rock of The Ages, my peace will not be shaken. \n
But those who know not The Lord will be taken down Satan's warpath, \n
Spiritually deceived they are all being led to God's final bloodbath. \n
But God's children have been redeemed and put on Salvation's path, \n
Have The Lord Jesus as their light and fear not war or the aftermath. \n
God's Judgment will fall on those who chose to mock and simply laugh, \n
But, those who chose to humbly fear The Lord will not suffer wrath. \n
And before God pours His Judgment down upon this wicked vile earth, \n
The Lord Jesus will first come to the clouds, to rapture His Church. \n
Friend, with many ominous signs you can be sure the end is very near, \n
Christians whose eyes are fixed on Jesus have nothing at all to fear. \n
Like the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of The Son of Man, \n
Take a look friend, and see these signs today are definitely at hand. \n
The earth became corrupt and all the people had corrupted their ways. \n
The earth was filled with violence friend, and this was Noah's days. \n
Not woe, but The Lord's return is what we should all be anticipating, \n
And with joy, for He comes with Salvation to those who are waiting. \n

What do people fear? \n
We fear things we don't understand, \n
We fear things that can hurt us, \n
We fear things that put shivers up our spines, \n
We fear things that we see that we wish we didn't, \n
So why do you fear? \n<|endoftext|>
fear \n
Is it possible to have one fear? \n
Can you be afraid of fear? \n
Am I hidding in the shadow of fear? \n
I can standup for myself but can't stand up to me \n
I'm scared of being scared \n
I want to find myself facing my fears \n
Diving head first into danger \n
But don't want to hesitate knowing, \n
fear itself might hold me back. \n
Grasping me tightly until I fear all that is known \n
Scared of dark corners, creaking noises. \n
All together I still fear, fear the most. \n

Fear of Love \n
Have you ever loved someone so much that fear takes control of every emotions. \n
Fear of loving. \n
Fear of losing that felling of floating on air. \n
Fear of one day hearing the words…goodbye… \n
How can love & fear be twisted in one so that you can't even tell them apart. \n
Maybe, loving means risking everything for that one person who makes you feel larger then life. \n
I feel that with you, fear. \n
Fear of feelings I promised myself I would not feel again. \n
Fear of giving myself to be hurt again. \n
Fear of saying goodbye and never loving again. \n
Where do I go from here? \n
Do I let my fear of not being enough drive me away? \n
Do I let go now and let fear win? \n
Do I hold on and allow fear to drive you away? \n
Or do I hold on and shut fear out and know that real love will win? \n
Whatever path our love leads us down one thing I know is true. \n
Your love had made me realize what it is to love so much that fear takes control. \n
Whether that is good or bad remains to be seen. \n
Love knows no time, no place, and no fear. \n
We do that on our own. \n
We try to reason something, love, that had no reasoning about it. \n
Always from a far I saw you. \n
Until one day you were there with warmth in you face I could not refuse. \n
Now you are the man I dream of. \n
A fear I never expected when I looked at you. \n
A love that lit like a candle in a dark still room. \n
In one flash you lighted my heart with warmth and fear. \n
I do not know if fear of losing you will win. \n
Or if I have the strength to hold on and wait for our love to flourish into a lifetime of security and happiness. \n
The one thing I do know is that my fear of losing you is my heart admitting that there is a part of you I hold dear. \n
And that is the love I feel for you growing each day. \n

fear \n
Is blind fear blind? \n
Yes, it is \n
Is blind fear fear? \n

Can blind fear destroy? \n
Yes, it can \n

fear \n
Fear is not what I am afraid of. \n
True, it is a frightful thing to fear; \n
But the fear of fearing fear is overwhelming \n
Especially when its form becomes sheer \n
Fear is like losing a tree of shade on a bristling day \n
Or losing your breath when you fall below the sea; \n
I fear this fear of fearing these fears \n
And it is this fear that is part and parcel of me. \n
Fear is like loving without being loved back, \n
Fear is like leaving without being left; \n
And the fear of loving and leaving and being loved and being left \n
Is opposed by the fear of not fearing anything \n
And being an empty vase, noisy and bereft \n
I fear not death nor do I fear life, \n
But I fear the fear of both as my peers; \n
If I could release one fear from my fears \n
It would be the fear of fearing these fears. \n<|endoftext|>
fear \n
Fear no more the heat o' the sun; \n
Nor the furious winter's rages, \n
Thou thy worldly task hast done, \n
Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages; \n

As chimney sweepers come to dust. \n
Fear no more the frown of the great, \n
Thou art past the tyrant's stroke: \n

The sceptre, learning, physic, must \n

Nor the all-dread thunder-stone; \n
Fear not slander, censure rash; \n
Thou hast finished joy and moan; \n
All lovers young, all lovers must \n
Consign to thee, and come to dust. \n
No exorciser harm thee! \n
Nor no witchcraft charm thee! \n
Ghost unlaid forbear thee! \n
Nothing ill come near thee! \n
Quiet consummation have; \n

About cook recipes, \n
Not even the monsters, \n
I do despise. \n
No only one thing, \n
Do fear with a passion, \n
No, it’s not girls, \n
Who’re too into fashion. \n
I fear for to be lonely, \n
Without family and friends, \n

fear \n
Therefore death to us \n
Is nothing, nor concerns us in the least, \n
Since nature of mind is mortal evermore. \n
And just as in the ages gone before \n
We felt no touch of ill, when all sides round \n
To battle came the Carthaginian host, \n
And the times, shaken by tumultuous war, \n
Under the aery coasts of arching heaven \n
Shuddered and trembled, and all humankind \n
Doubted to which the empery should fall \n
By land and sea, thus when we are no more, \n
When comes that sundering of our body and soul \n
Through which we're fashioned to a single state, \n
Verily naught to us, us then no more, \n
Can come to pass, naught move our senses then- \n
No, not if earth confounded were with sea, \n
And sea with heaven. But if indeed do feel \n
The nature of mind and energy of soul, \n
After their severance from this body of ours, \n
Yet nothing 'tis to us who in the bonds \n
And wedlock of the soul and body live, \n
Through which we're fashioned to a single state. \n
And, even if time collected after death \n
The matter of our frames and set it all \n
Again in place as now, and if again \n
To us the light of life were given, O yet \n
That process too would not concern us aught, \n
When once the self-succession of our sense \n
Has been asunder broken. And now and here, \n
Little enough we're busied with the selves \n
We were aforetime, nor, concerning them, \n
Suffer a sore distress. For shouldst thou gaze \n
Backwards across all yesterdays of time \n
The immeasurable, thinking how manifold \n
The motions of matter are, then couldst thou well \n
Credit this too: often these very seeds \n
(From which we are to-day) of old were set \n
In the same order as they are to-day- \n
Yet this we can't to consciousness recall \n
Through the remembering mind. For there hath been \n
An interposed pause of life, and wide \n
Have all the motions wandered everywhere \n
From these our senses. For if woe and ail \n
Perchance are toward, then the man to whom \n
The bane can happen must himself be there \n
At that same time. But death precludeth this, \n
Forbidding life to him on whom might crowd \n
Such irk and care; and granted 'tis to know: \n
Nothing for us there is to dread in death, \n
No wretchedness for him who is no more, \n
The same estate as if ne'er born before, \n
When death immortal hath ta'en the mortal life. \n
Hence, where thou seest a man to grieve because \n
When dead he rots with body laid away, \n
Or perishes in flames or jaws of beasts, \n
Know well: he rings not true, and that beneath \n
Still works an unseen sting upon his heart, \n
However he deny that he believes. \n
His shall be aught of feeling after death. \n
For he, I fancy, grants not what he says, \n
Nor what that presupposes, and he fails \n
To pluck himself with all his roots from life \n
And cast that self away, quite unawares \n
Feigning that some remainder's left behind. \n
For when in life one pictures to oneself \n
His body dead by beasts and vultures torn, \n
He pities his state, dividing not himself \n
Therefrom, removing not the self enough \n
From the body flung away, imagining \n
Himself that body, and projecting there \n
His own sense, as he stands beside it: hence \n
He grieves that he is mortal born, nor marks \n
That in true death there is no second self \n
Alive and able to sorrow for self destroyed, \n
Or stand lamenting that the self lies there \n
Mangled or burning. For if it an evil is \n
Dead to be jerked about by jaw and fang \n
Of the wild brutes, I see not why 'twere not \n
Bitter to lie on fires and roast in flames, \n
Or suffocate in honey, and, reclined \n
On the smooth oblong of an icy slab, \n
Grow stiff in cold, or sink with load of earth \n
Down-crushing from above. \n
"Thee now no more \n
The joyful house and best of wives shall welcome, \n
Nor little sons run up to snatch their kisses \n
And touch with silent happiness thy heart. \n
Thou shalt not speed in undertakings more, \n
Nor be the warder of thine own no more. \n
Poor wretch," they say, "one hostile hour hath ta'en \n
Wretchedly from thee all life's many guerdons," \n
But add not, "yet no longer unto thee \n
Remains a remnant of desire for them" \n
If this they only well perceived with mind \n
And followed up with maxims, they would free \n
Their state of man from anguish and from fear. \n
"O even as here thou art, aslumber in death, \n
So shalt thou slumber down the rest of time, \n
Released from every harrying pang. But we, \n
We have bewept thee with insatiate woe, \n
Standing beside whilst on the awful pyre \n
Thou wert made ashes; and no day shall take \n
For us the eternal sorrow from the breast." \n
But ask the mourner what's the bitterness \n
That man should waste in an eternal grief, \n
If, after all, the thing's but sleep and rest? \n
For when the soul and frame together are sunk \n
In slumber, no one then demands his self \n
Or being. Well, this sleep may be forever, \n
Without desire of any selfhood more, \n
For all it matters unto us asleep. \n
Yet not at all do those primordial germs \n
Roam round our members, at that time, afar \n
From their own motions that produce our senses- \n
Since, when he's startled from his sleep, a man \n
Collects his senses. Death is, then, to us \n
Much less- if there can be a less than that \n
Which is itself a nothing: for there comes \n
Hard upon death a scattering more great \n
Of the throng of matter, and no man wakes up \n
On whom once falls the icy pause of life. \n
This too, O often from the soul men say, \n
Along their couches holding of the cups, \n
With faces shaded by fresh wreaths awry: \n
"Brief is this fruit of joy to paltry man, \n
Soon, soon departed, and thereafter, no, \n
It may not be recalled."- As if, forsooth, \n
It were their prime of evils in great death \n
To parch, poor tongues, with thirst and arid drought, \n
Or chafe for any lack. \n
Once more, if Nature \n
Should of a sudden send a voice abroad, \n
And her own self inveigh against us so: \n
"Mortal, what hast thou of such grave concern \n
That thou indulgest in too sickly plaints? \n
Why this bemoaning and beweeping death? \n
For if thy life aforetime and behind \n
To thee was grateful, and not all thy good \n
Was heaped as in sieve to flow away \n
And perish unavailingly, why not, \n
Even like a banqueter, depart the halls, \n
Laden with life? why not with mind content \n
Take now, thou fool, thy unafflicted rest? \n
But if whatever thou enjoyed hath been \n
Lavished and lost, and life is now offence, \n
Why seekest more to add- which in its turn \n
Will perish foully and fall out in vain? \n
O why not rather make an end of life, \n
Of labour? For all I may devise or find \n
To pleasure thee is nothing: all things are \n
The same forever. Though not yet thy body \n
Wrinkles with years, nor yet the frame exhausts \n
Outworn, still things abide the same, even if \n
Thou goest on to conquer all of time \n
With length of days, yea, if thou never diest"- \n
What were our answer, but that Nature here \n
Urges just suit and in her words lays down \n
True cause of action? Yet should one complain, \n
Riper in years and elder, and lament, \n
Poor devil, his death more sorely than is fit, \n
Then would she not, with greater right, on him \n
Cry out, inveighing with a voice more shrill: \n
"Off with thy tears, and choke thy whines, buffoon! \n
Thou wrinklest- after thou hast had the sum \n
Of the guerdons of life; yet, since thou cravest ever \n
What's not at hand, contemning present good, \n
That life has slipped away, unperfected \n
And unavailing unto thee. And now, \n
Or ere thou guessed it, death beside thy head \n
Stands- and before thou canst be going home \n
Sated and laden with the goodly feast. \n
But now yield all that's alien to thine age,- \n
Up, with good grace! make room for sons: thou must." \n
Justly, I fancy, would she reason thus, \n
Justly inveigh and gird: since ever the old \n
Outcrowded by the new gives way, and ever \n
The one thing from the others is repaired. \n
Nor no man is consigned to the abyss \n
Of Tartarus, the black. For stuff must be, \n
That thus the after-generations grow,- \n
Though these, their life completed, follow thee; \n
And thus like thee are generations all- \n
Already fallen, or some time to fall. \n
So one thing from another rises ever; \n
And in fee-simple life is given to none, \n
But unto all mere usufruct. \n
Look back: \n
Nothing to us was all fore-passed eld \n
Of time the eternal, ere we had a birth. \n
And Nature holds this like a mirror up \n
Of time-to-be when we are dead and gone. \n
And what is there so horrible appears? \n
Now what is there so sad about it all? \n
Is't not serener far than any sleep? \n
And, verily, those tortures said to be \n
In Acheron, the deep, they all are ours \n
Here in this life. No Tantalus, benumbed \n
With baseless terror, as the fables tell, \n
Fears the huge boulder hanging in the air: \n
But, rather, in life an empty dread of gods \n
Urges mortality, and each one fears \n
Such fall of fortune as may chance to him. \n
Nor eat the vultures into Tityus \n
Prostrate in Acheron, nor can they find, \n
Forsooth, throughout eternal ages, aught \n
To pry around for in that mighty breast. \n
However hugely he extend his bulk- \n
Who hath for outspread limbs not acres nine, \n
But the whole earth- he shall not able be \n
To bear eternal pain nor furnish food \n
From his own frame forever. But for us \n
A Tityus is he whom vultures rend \n
Prostrate in love, whom anxious anguish eats, \n
Whom troubles of any unappeased desires \n
Asunder rip. We have before our eyes \n
Here in this life also a Sisyphus \n
In him who seeketh of the populace \n
The rods, the axes fell, and evermore \n
Retires a beaten and a gloomy man. \n
For to seek after power- an empty name, \n
Nor given at all- and ever in the search \n
To endure a world of toil, O this it is \n
To shove with shoulder up the hill a stone \n
Which yet comes rolling back from off the top, \n
And headlong makes for levels of the plain. \n
Then to be always feeding an ingrate mind, \n
Filling with good things, satisfying never- \n
As do the seasons of the year for us, \n
When they return and bring their progenies \n
And varied charms, and we are never filled \n
With the fruits of life- O this, I fancy, 'tis \n
To pour, like those young virgins in the tale, \n
Waters into a sieve, unfilled forever. \n<|endoftext|>

frog \n
Three men I saw beside a bar, \n
Regarding o'er their bottle, \n
A frog who smoked a rank cigar \n
They'd jammed within its throttle. \n
A Pasha frog it must have been \n
So big it as and bloated; \n
And from its lips the nicotine \n
In graceful festoon floated. \n
And while the trio jeered and joked, \n
As if it quite enjoyed it, \n
Impassively it smoked and smoked, \n
(It could now well avoid it). \n
A ring of fire its lips were nigh \n
Yet it seemed all unwitting; \n
It could not spit, like you and I, \n
Who've learned the art of spitting. \n
It did not wink, it did not shrink, \n
As there serene it squatted' \n
Its eyes were clear, it did not fear \n
The fate the Gods allotted. \n
It squatted there with calm sublime, \n
Amid their cruel guying; \n
Grave as a god, and all the time \n
It knew that it was dying. \n
And somehow then it seemed to me \n
These men expectorating, \n
Were infinitely less than he, \n
The dumb thing they were baiting. \n
It seemed to say, despite their jokes: \n
"This is my hour of glory. \n
It isn't every frog that smokes: \n
My name will live in story." \n
Before its nose the smoke arose; \n
The flame grew nigher, nigher; \n
And then I saw its bright eyes close \n
Beside that ring of fire. \n
They turned it on its warty back, \n
From off its bloated belly; \n
It legs jerked out, then dangled slack; \n
It quivered like a jelly. \n
And then the fellows went away, \n
Contented with their joking; \n
But even as in death it lay, \n
The frog continued smoking. \n
Life's like a lighted fag, thought I; \n
We smoke it stale; then after \n
Death turns our belly to the sky: \n
The Gods must have their laughter. \n<|endoftext|>

frog \n
Once upon a time a frog \n
Croaked away in Bingle Bog \n
Every night from dusk to dawn \n
He croaked awn and awn and awn \n
Other creatures loathed his voice, \n
But, alas, they had no choice, \n
And the crass cacophony \n
Blared out from the sumac tree \n
At whose foot the frog each night \n
Minstrelled on till morning night \n
Neither stones nor prayers nor sticks. \n
Insults or complaints or bricks \n
Stilled the frogs determination \n
To display his heart's elation. \n
But one night a nightingale \n
In the moonlight cold and pale \n
Perched upon the sumac tree \n
Casting forth her melody \n
Dumbstruck sat the gaping frog \n
And the whole admiring bog \n
Stared towards the sumac, rapt, \n
And, when she had ended, clapped, \n
Ducks had swum and herons waded \n
To her as she serenaded \n
And a solitary loon \n
Wept, beneath the summer moon. \n
Toads and teals and tiddlers, captured \n
By her voice, cheered on, enraptured: \n
"Bravo! " "Too divine! " "Encore! " \n
So the nightingale once more, \n
Quite unused to such applause, \n
Sang till dawn without a pause. \n
Next night when the Nightingale \n
Shook her head and twitched her tail, \n
Closed an eye and fluffed a wing \n
And had cleared her throat to sing \n
She was startled by a croak. \n
"Sorry - was that you who spoke? " \n
She enquired when the frog \n
Hopped towards her from the bog. \n
"Yes," the frog replied. "You see, \n
I'm the frog who owns this tree \n
In this bog I've long been known \n
For my splendid baritone \n
And, of course, I wield my pen \n
For Bog Trumpet now and then" \n
"Did you… did you like my song? " \n
"Not too bad - but far too long. \n
The technique was fine of course, \n
But it lacked a certain force". \n
"Oh! " the nightingale confessed. \n
Greatly flattered and impressed \n
That a critic of such note \n
Had discussed her art and throat: \n
"I don't think the song's divine. \n
But - oh, well - at least it's mine". \n
"That's not much to boast about". \n
Said the heartless frog. "Without \n
Proper training such as I \n
- And few others can supply. \n
You'll remain a mere beginner. \n
But with me you'll be a winner" \n
"Dearest frog", the nightingale \n
Breathed: "This is a fairy tale - \n
And you are Mozart in disguise \n
Come to earth before my eyes". \n
"Well I charge a modest fee." \n
"Oh! " "But it won't hurt, you'll see" \n
Now the nightingale inspired, \n
Flushed with confidence, and fired \n
With both art and adoration, \n
Sang - and was a huge sensation. \n
Animals for miles around \n
Flocked towards the magic sound, \n
And the frog with great precision \n
Counted heads and charged admission. \n
Though next morning it was raining, \n
He began her vocal training. \n
"But I can't sing in this weather" \n
"Come my dear - we'll sing together. \n
Just put on your scarf and sash, \n
Koo-oh-ah! ko-ash! ko-ash! " \n
So the frog and nightingale \n
Journeyed up and down the scale \n
For six hours, till she was shivering \n
and her voice was hoarse and quivering. \n
Though subdued and sleep deprived, \n
In the night her throat revived, \n
And the sumac tree was bowed, \n
With a breathless, titled crowd: \n
Owl of Sandwich, Duck of Kent, \n
Mallard and Milady Trent, \n
Martin Cardinal Mephisto, \n
And the Coot of Monte Cristo, \n
Ladies with tiaras glittering \n
In the interval sat twittering - \n
And the frog observed them glitter \n
With a joy both sweet and bitter. \n
Every day the frog who'd sold her \n
Songs for silver tried to scold her: \n
"You must practice even longer \n
Till your voice, like mine grows stronger. \n
In the second song last night \n
You got nervous in mid-flight. \n
And, my dear, lay on more trills: \n
Audiences enjoy such frills. \n
You must make your public happier: \n
Give them something sharper snappier. \n
We must aim for better billings. \n
You still owe me sixty shillings." \n
Day by day the nightingale \n
Grew more sorrowful and pale. \n
Night on night her tired song \n
Zipped and trilled and bounced along, \n
Till the birds and beasts grew tired \n
At a voice so uninspired \n
And the ticket office gross \n
Crashed, and she grew more morose - \n
For her ears were now addicted \n
To applause quite unrestricted, \n
And to sing into the night \n
All alone gave no delight. \n
Now the frog puffed up with rage. \n
"Brainless bird - you're on the stage - \n
Use your wits and follow fashion. \n
Puff your lungs out with your passion." \n
Trembling, terrified to fail, \n
Blind with tears, the nightingale \n
Heard him out in silence, tried, \n
Puffed up, burst a vein, and died. \n
Said the frog: "I tried to teach her, \n
But she was a stupid creature - \n
Far too nervous, far too tense. \n
Far too prone to influence. \n
Well, poor bird - she should have known \n
That your song must be your own. \n
That's why I sing with panache: \n
"Koo-oh-ah! ko-ash! ko-ash! " \n
And the foghorn of the frog \n
Blared unrivalled through the bog. \n<|endoftext|>

Man prides himself with intelligence \n
Human Logic rationalizing, \n
But what he really lacks is Patience \n
When the moment requires some waiting. \n
Today a frog in blithe expertise, \n
Had some short lessons laid in action. \n
He showed that trying should never cease, \n
For Success comes with Repetition. \n
He jumped on a green stalk, missing twice. \n
Then returned to make good his attempt. \n
Jumped once more, no defeat in his eyes - \n
He missed, but held the end of the hemp. \n
He climbed one leg up, still holding on, \n
His frog face tinged the trace of a smile, \n
His other arm grasped at victory won - \n
Sat on top of the leaf in a while! \n<|endoftext|>

There stands upon a leaf, \n
A tiny frog, \n
With yellow skin, \n
And large round eyes, \n
In search of insects-food! \n
The little frog can camouflage, \n
And appear dead, \n
Or look like flowers, \n
To escape foes, \n
And predators that strike. \n
Like energized spring-box, \n
The frog can leap; \n
The frog can fly; \n
The frog won’t fall, \n
As they hold on \n
To weeds and stalks of plants. \n
Oh, what a queer Amphibian \n
Are frogs born free! \n
Some are big too; \n
Their tongues are long, \n
And so sticky; \n
They flick it out and catch their prey. \n

frog \n
The fairy tale says, \n
that every time you kiss \n
a frog or is it a toad, \n
it turns into a prince or a princess, \n
depending on which story you have heard. \n
I thought that I would test the theory. \n
First on a frog, I tried, \n
but nothing happened there. \n
Then I grabbed the biggest toad, \n
gave it a great big kiss as you know. \n
All I ended up with was a big wart \n
on the end of my nose. \n
So if you are looking for a prince or princess, \n
do not kiss a frog or toad, \n
because you might end up like me, \n
with a big wart on the end of your nose. \n<|endoftext|>

When the rain pattered \n
The frog started croaking \n
The monkey on the tree warned \n
'Danger is in ambush' \n
She wouldn't listen too \n
'I know, my father \n
Keeps saying this' \n
She said \n
The monkey didn't ask \n
'Is your father too a monkey? ' \n
The frog got finished \n
In one hiss \n
So was she finished \n
In one miss \n<|endoftext|>

I DREAMED that one had died in a strange place \n
Near no accustomed hand, \n
And they had nailed the boards above her face, \n
The peasants of that land, \n
Wondering to lay her in that solitude, \n
And raised above her mound \n
A cross they had made out of two bits of wood, \n
And planted cypress round; \n
And left her to the indifferent stars above \n
Until I carved these words: \n
i{She was more beautiful than thy first love,} \n
i{But now lies under boards.} \n<|endoftext|>

What happens to a dream deferred? \n
Does it dry up \n
Like a raisin in the sun? \n
Or fester like a sore-- \n
And then run? \n
Does it stink like rotten meat? \n

Maybe it just sags \n

dream \n
Last night, mother, he told me so, \n
As we walked by the pebbly stream; \n
And I wake so happy--so wild with joy, \n
It seems like a fairy dream. \n
But his charming voice is ringing in my ear, \n
As a dream voice chould not be-- \n
He's the best man, you know, in the whole wide world, \n
And he loves--he only love me. \n
Kiss me, mother, and share the joy \n
That has on my fortune smiled; \n
You have shared myu sorrows when e'er I wept, \n
Since I was a little child \n
Do you chide me now? what could your darling do, \n
When he pleads with bended knee? \n
He's the best man, you know, in the whole wide world, \n
And he loves--he only loves me. \n
Leave you, mother, it brings a pang \n
To this light and bounding heart; \n
But if he were calling, the bride would go, \n
Tho' you and the daughter part. \n
At a word from him, a beckon of his hand, \n
I would cross the rolling sea-- \n
He's the best man, you know, in the whole wide world, \n
And he loves--he only loves me. \n<|endoftext|>

Fading from sight; \n
Only a flooding of tears that shudder and stream \n

dream \n
O God, in the dream the terrible horse began \n
To paw at the air, and make for me with his blows, \n
Fear kept for thirty-five years poured through his mane, \n
And retribution equally old, or nearly, breathed through his nose. \n
Coward complete, I lay and wept on the ground \n
When some strong creature appeared, and leapt for the rein. \n
Another woman, as I lay half in a swound \n
Leapt in the air, and clutched at the leather and chain. \n
Give him, she said, something of yours as a charm. \n
Throw him, she said, some poor thing you alone claim. \n
No, no, I cried, he hates me; he is out for harm, \n
And whether I yield or not, it is all the same. \n
But, like a lion in a legend, when I flung the glove \n
Pulled from my sweating, my cold right hand; \n
The terrible beast, that no one may understand, \n
Came to my side, and put down his head in love. \n<|endoftext|>

Take this kiss upon the brow! \n
And, in parting from you now, \n
Thus much let me avow- \n

Yet if hope has flown away \n
In a night, or in a day, \n
In a vision, or in none, \n
Is it therefore the less gone? \n
All that we see or seem \n
Is but a dream within a dream. \n
I stand amid the roar \n
Of a surf-tormented shore, \n
And I hold within my hand \n
Grains of the golden sand- \n
How few! yet how they creep \n
Through my fingers to the deep, \n
While I weep- while I weep! \n
O God! can I not grasp \n
Them with a tighter clasp? \n
O God! can I not save \n
One from the pitiless wave? \n
Is all that we see or seem \n
But a dream within a dream? \n<|endoftext|>

It's funny how we always seem, \n
To be so happy in a dream, \n
Yet when it's time for us to wake, \n
We think our dreams a big mistake. It's funny how in proper life, \n
We seem so bent on war and strife, \n
If only we would try to live, \n
To be forgiving and to give. Then to us our life would seem, \n
To be the same as in our dream, \n
And in the morn when we awake, \n
We'd never make the same mistake. \n<|endoftext|>

Unstable dream, according to the place, \n
Be steadfast once, or else at least be true. \n
By tasted sweetness make me not to rue \n

By good respect in such a dangerous case \n
Thou broughtest not her into this tossing mew \n
But madest my sprite live, my care to renew, \n
My body in tempest her succour to embrace. \n
The body dead, the sprite had his desire, \n
Painless was th'one, th'other in delight. \n
Why then, alas, did it not keep it right, \n
Returning, to leap into the fire? \n
And where it was at wish, it could not remain, \n
Such mocks of dreams they turn to deadly pain. \n<|endoftext|>
dream \n
Beside the ungathered rice he lay, \n
His sickle in his hand; \n
His breast was bare, his matted hair \n
Was buried in the sand. \n
Again, in the mist and shadow of sleep, \n
He saw his Native Land. \n
Wide through the landscape of his dreams \n
The lordly Niger flowed; \n
Beneath the palm-trees on the plain \n
Once more a king he strode; \n
And heard the tinkling caravans \n
Descend the mountain-road. \n
He saw once more his dark-eyed queen \n
Among her children stand; \n
They clasped his neck, they kissed his cheeks, \n
They held him by the hand!-- \n
A tear burst from the sleeper's lids \n
And fell into the sand. \n
And then at furious speed he rode \n
Along the Niger's bank; \n
His bridle-reins were golden chains, \n
And, with a martial clank, \n
At each leap he could feel his scabbard of steel \n
Smiting his stallion's flank. \n
Before him, like a blood-red flag, \n
The bright flamingoes flew; \n
>From morn till night he followed their flight, \n
O'er plains where the tamarind grew, \n
Till he saw the roofs of Caffre huts, \n
And the ocean rose to view. \n
At night he heard the lion roar, \n
And the hyena scream, \n
And the river-horse, as he crushed the reeds \n
Beside some hidden stream; \n
And it passed, like a glorious roll of drums, \n
Through the triumph of his dream. \n
The forests, with their myriad tongues, \n
Shouted of liberty; \n
And the Blast of the Desert cried aloud, \n
With a voice so wild and free, \n
That he started in his sleep and smiled \n
At their tempestuous glee. \n
He did not feel the driver's whip, \n
Nor the burning heat of day; \n
For Death had illumined the Land of Sleep, \n
And his lifeless body lay \n
A worn-out fetter, that the soul \n
Had broken and thrown away! \n<|endoftext|>

dream \n
I heard the dogs howl in the moonlight night; \n
I went to the window to see the sight; \n
All the Dead that ever I knew \n
Going one by one and two by two. \n
On they pass'd, and on they pass'd; \n
Townsfellows all, from first to last; \n
Born in the moonlight of the lane, \n
Quench'd in the heavy shadow again. \n
Schoolmates, marching as when they play'd \n
At soldiers once - but now more staid; \n
Those were the strangest sight to me \n
Who were drown'd, I knew, in the awful sea. \n
Straight and handsome folk, bent and weak, too; \n
Some that I loved, and gasp'd to speak to; \n
Some but a day in their churchyard bed; \n
Some that I had not known were dead. \n
A long, long crowd - where each seem'd lonely, \n
Yet of them all there was one, one only, \n
Raised a head or look'd my way; \n
She linger'd a moment - she might not stay. \n
How long since I saw that fair pale face! \n
Ah! Mother dear! might I only place \n
My head on thy breast, a moment to rest, \n
While thy hand on my tearful cheek were prest! \n
On, on, a moving bridge they made \n
Across the moon-stream, from shade to shade, \n
Young and old, women and men; \n
Many long-forgot, but remembered then, \n
And first there came a bitter laughter; \n
A sound of tears a moment after; \n
And then a music so lofty and gay, \n
That eve morning, day by day, \n
I strive to recall it if I may. \n<|endoftext|>

Even in my wildest of dreams \n

It's life like dream half blur, half clear \n

Oft dreams ornate like the Sun \n
donning the bright chaplet of light \n

It's life like dream half blur, half clear \n
and dreams solid and palpable. \n
Lo life, a swim in reverie main. \n
In trance flapping the limbs we wade \n
through swirling waves of vague pictures \n
of fleeting world, presumed as true. \n
It's life like dream half blur, half clear \n
and dreams solid and palpable. \n
It's all mind-made, emotions jelled. \n
In solitude we feel around \n
a millions' scary raw din \n
and while amongst a myriad souls; \n
alone, distressed, depressed and sad. \n
It's life like dream half blur, half clear \n
and dreams solid and palpable. \n
Like sharks wile thoughts nibble \n
Like whales with yawning mouths, fears gulp \n
Some joys flicker, few hues shimmer \n

dream \n
How neatly a cat sleeps, \n
sleeps with its paws and its posture, \n
sleeps with its wicked claws, \n
and with its unfeeling blood, \n
sleeps with all the rings- \n
a series of burnt circles- \n
which have formed the odd geology \n
of its sand-colored tail. \n
I should like to sleep like a cat, \n
with all the fur of time, \n
with a tongue rough as flint, \n
with the dry sex of fire; \n
and after speaking to no one, \n
stretch myself over the world, \n
over roofs and landscapes, \n
with a passionate desire \n
to hunt the rats in my dreams. \n
I have seen how the cat asleep \n
would undulate, how the night \n
flowed through it like dark water; \n
and at times, it was going to fall \n
or possibly plunge into \n
the bare deserted snowdrifts. \n
Sometimes it grew so much in sleep \n
like a tiger's great-grandfather, \n
and would leap in the darkness over \n
rooftops, clouds and volcanoes. \n
Sleep, sleep cat of the night, \n
with episcopal ceremony \n
and your stone-carved moustache. \n
Take care of all our dreams; \n
control the obscurity \n
of our slumbering prowess \n
with your relentless heart \n
and the great ruff of your tail. \n

life was breezy \n

Loving you \n

dream \n
The dream of those days when first I sung thee is o'er \n
Thy triumph hath stain'd the charm thy sorrows then wore; \n
And even the light which Hope once shed o'er thy chains, \n
Alas, not a gleam to grace thy freedom remains. \n
Say, is it that slavery sunk so deep in thy heart, \n
That still the dark brand is there, though chainless thou art; \n
And Freedom's sweet fruit, for which thy spirit long burn'd, \n
Now, reaching at last thy lip, to ashes hath turn'd? \n
Up Liberty's steep by Truth and Eloquence led, \n
With eyes on her temple fix'd, how proud was thy tread! \n
Ah, better thou ne'er hadst lived that summit to gain, \n
Denied in the porch, than thus dishonour the fane. \n<|endoftext|>
dream \n
Image of her whom I love, more than she, \n
Whose fair impression in my faithful heart \n
Makes me her medal, and makes her love me, \n
As Kings do coins, to which their stamps impart \n
The value: go, and take my heart from hence, \n
Which now is grown too great and good for me: \n
Honours oppress weak spirits, and our sense \n
Strong objects dull; the more, the less we see. \n
When you are gone, and Reason gone with you, \n
Then Fantasy is queen and soul, and all; \n
She can present joys meaner than you do; \n
Convenient, and more proportional. \n
So, if I dream I have you, I have you, \n
For, all our joys are but fantastical. \n
And so I 'scape the pain, for pain is true; \n
And sleep which locks up sense, doth lock out all. \n
After a such fruition I shall wake, \n
And, but the waking, nothing shall repent; \n
And shall to love more thankful sonnets make \n
Than if more honour, tears, and pains were spent. \n
But dearest heart, and dearer image, stay; \n
Alas, true joys at best are dream enough; \n
Though you stay here you pass too fast away: \n
For even at first life's taper is a snuff. \n
Filied with her love, may I be rather grown \n
Mad with much heart, than idiot with none. \n<|endoftext|>

O'er the level plain of water? \n
Or the Red Swan floating, flying, \n
Wounded by the magic arrow, \n
Staining all the waves with crimson, \n
With the crimson of its life-blood, \n
Filling all the air with splendor, \n
With the splendor of its plumage? \n
Yes; it is the sun descending, \n
Sinking down into the water; \n

No; it is the Red Swan floating, \n
Diving down beneath the water; \n
To the sky its wings are lifted, \n

Over it the Star of Evening \n
Melts and trembles through the purple, \n
Hangs suspended in the twilight. \n
No; it is a bead of wampum \n
On the robes of the Great Spirit \n
As he passes through the twilight, \n
Walks in silence through the heavens. \n
This with joy beheld Iagoo \n
And he said in haste: "Behold it! \n
See the sacred Star of Evening! \n
You shall hear a tale of wonder, \n
Hear the story of Osseo, \n
Son of the Evening Star, Osseo! \n
"Once, in days no more remembered, \n
Ages nearer the beginning, \n
When the heavens were closer to us, \n
And the Gods were more familiar, \n
In the North-land lived a hunter, \n
With ten young and comely daughters, \n
Tall and lithe as wands of willow; \n
Only Oweenee, the youngest, \n
She the wilful and the wayward, \n
She the silent, dreamy maiden, \n
Was the fairest of the sisters. \n
"All these women married warriors, \n
Married brave and haughty husbands; \n
Only Oweenee, the youngest, \n
Laughed and flouted all her lovers, \n
All her young and handsome suitors, \n
And then married old Osseo, \n
Old Osseo, poor and ugly, \n
Broken with age and weak with coughing, \n
Always coughing like a squirrel. \n
"Ah, but beautiful within him \n
Was the spirit of Osseo, \n
From the Evening Star descended, \n
Star of Evening, Star of Woman, \n
Star of tenderness and passion! \n
All its fire was in his bosom, \n
All its beauty in his spirit, \n
All its mystery in his being, \n
All its splendor in his language! \n
"And her lovers, the rejected, \n
Handsome men with belts of wampum, \n
Handsome men with paint and feathers. \n
Pointed at her in derision, \n
Followed her with jest and laughter. \n
But she said: 'I care not for you, \n
Care not for your belts of wampum, \n
Care not for your paint and feathers, \n
Care not for your jests and laughter; \n
I am happy with Osseo!' \n
'Once to some great feast invited, \n
Through the damp and dusk of evening, \n
Walked together the ten sisters, \n
Walked together with their husbands; \n
Slowly followed old Osseo, \n
With fair Oweenee beside him; \n
All the others chatted gayly, \n
These two only walked in silence. \n
"At the western sky Osseo \n
Gazed intent, as if imploring, \n
Often stopped and gazed imploring \n
At the trembling Star of Evening, \n
At the tender Star of Woman; \n
And they heard him murmur softly, \n
'Ah, showain nemeshin, Nosa! \n
Pity, pity me, my father!' \n
'Listen!' said the eldest sister, \n
'He is praying to his father! \n
What a pity that the old man \n
Does not stumble in the pathway, \n
Does not break his neck by falling!' \n
And they laughed till all the forest \n
Rang with their unseemly laughter. \n
"On their pathway through the woodlands \n
Lay an oak, by storms uprooted, \n
Lay the great trunk of an oak-tree, \n
Buried half in leaves and mosses, \n
Mouldering, crumbling, huge and hollow. \n
And Osseo, when he saw it, \n
Gave a shout, a cry of anguish, \n
Leaped into its yawning cavern, \n
At one end went in an old man, \n
Wasted, wrinkled, old, and ugly; \n
From the other came a young man, \n
Tall and straight and strong and handsome. \n
"Thus Osseo was transfigured, \n
Thus restored to youth and beauty; \n
But, alas for good Osseo, \n
And for Oweenee, the faithful! \n
Strangely, too, was she transfigured. \n
Changed into a weak old woman, \n
With a staff she tottered onward, \n
Wasted, wrinkled, old, and ugly! \n
And the sisters and their husbands \n
Laughed until the echoing forest \n
Rang with their unseemly laughter. \n
"But Osseo turned not from her, \n
Walked with slower step beside her, \n
Took her hand, as brown and withered \n
As an oak-leaf is in Winter, \n
Called her sweetheart, Nenemoosha, \n
Soothed her with soft words of kindness, \n
Till they reached the lodge of feasting, \n
Till they sat down in the wigwam, \n
Sacred to the Star of Evening, \n
To the tender Star of Woman. \n
"Wrapt in visions, lost in dreaming, \n
At the banquet sat Osseo; \n
All were merry, all were happy, \n
All were joyous but Osseo. \n
Neither food nor drink he tasted, \n
Neither did he speak nor listen; \n
But as one bewildered sat he, \n
Looking dreamily and sadly, \n
First at Oweenee, then upward \n
At the gleaming sky above them. \n
"Then a voice was heard, a whisper, \n
Coming from the starry distance, \n
Coming from the empty vastness, \n
Low, and musical, and tender; \n
And the voice said: 'O Osseo! \n
O my son, my best beloved! \n
Broken are the spells that bound you, \n
All the charms of the magicians, \n
All the magic powers of evil; \n
Come to me; ascend, Osseo! \n
"'Taste the food that stands before you: \n
It is blessed and enchanted, \n
It has magic virtues in it, \n
It will change you to a spirit. \n
All your bowls and all your kettles \n
Shall be wood and clay no longer; \n
But the bowls be changed to wampum, \n
And the kettles shall be silver; \n
They shall shine like shells of scarlet, \n
Like the fire shall gleam and glimmer. \n
"'And the women shall no longer \n
Bear the dreary doom of labor, \n
But be changed to birds, and glisten \n
With the beauty of the starlight, \n
Painted with the dusky splendors \n
Of the skies and clouds of evening!' \n
"What Osseo heard as whispers, \n
What as words he comprehended, \n
Was but music to the others, \n
Music as of birds afar off, \n
Of the whippoorwill afar off, \n
Of the lonely Wawonaissa \n
Singing in the darksome forest. \n
"Then the lodge began to tremble, \n
Straight began to shake and tremble, \n
And they felt it rising, rising, \n
Slowly through the air ascending, \n
From the darkness of the tree-tops \n
Forth into the dewy starlight, \n
Till it passed the topmost branches; \n
And behold! the wooden dishes \n
All were changed to shells of scarlet! \n
And behold! the earthen kettles \n
All were changed to bowls of silver! \n
And the roof-poles of the wigwam \n
Were as glittering rods of silver, \n
And the roof of bark upon them \n
As the shining shards of beetles. \n
"Then Osseo gazed around him, \n
And he saw the nine fair sisters, \n
All the sisters and their husbands, \n
Changed to birds of various plumage. \n
Some were jays and some were magpies, \n
Others thrushes, others blackbirds; \n
And they hopped, and sang, and twittered, \n
Perked and fluttered all their feathers, \n
Strutted in their shining plumage, \n
And their tails like fans unfolded. \n
"Only Oweenee, the youngest, \n
Was not changed, but sat in silence, \n
Wasted, wrinkled, old, and ugly, \n
Looking sadly at the others; \n
Till Osseo, gazing upward, \n
Gave another cry of anguish, \n
Such a cry as he had uttered \n
By the oak-tree in the forest. \n
"Then returned her youth and beauty, \n
And her soiled and tattered garments \n
Were transformed to robes of ermine, \n
And her staff became a feather, \n
Yes, a shining silver feather! \n
"And again the wigwam trembled, \n
Swayed and rushed through airy currents, \n
Through transparent cloud and vapor, \n
And amid celestial splendors \n
On the Evening Star alighted, \n
As a snow-flake falls on snow-flake, \n
As a leaf drops on a river, \n
As the thistledown on water. \n
"Forth with cheerful words of welcome \n
Came the father of Osseo, \n
He with radiant locks of silver, \n
He with eyes serene and tender. \n
And he said: `My son, Osseo, \n
Hang the cage of birds you bring there, \n
Hang the cage with rods of silver, \n
And the birds with glistening feathers, \n
At the doorway of my wigwam.' \n
"At the door he hung the bird-cage, \n
And they entered in and gladly \n
Listened to Osseo's father, \n
Ruler of the Star of Evening, \n
As he said: `O my Osseo! \n
I have had compassion on you, \n
Given you back your youth and beauty, \n
Into birds of various plumage \n
Changed your sisters and their husbands; \n
Changed them thus because they mocked you \n
In the figure of the old man, \n
In that aspect sad and wrinkled, \n
Could not see your heart of passion, \n
Could not see your youth immortal; \n
Only Oweenee, the faithful, \n
Saw your naked heart and loved you. \n
"`In the lodge that glimmers yonder, \n
In the little star that twinkles \n
Through the vapors, on the left hand, \n
Lives the envious Evil Spirit, \n
The Wabeno, the magician, \n
Who transformed you to an old man. \n
Take heed lest his beams fall on you, \n
For the rays he darts around him \n
Are the power of his enchantment, \n
Are the arrows that he uses.' \n
"Many years, in peace and quiet, \n
On the peaceful Star of Evening \n
Dwelt Osseo with his father; \n
Many years, in song and flutter, \n
At the doorway of the wigwam, \n
Hung the cage with rods of silver, \n
And fair Oweenee, the faithful, \n
Bore a son unto Osseo, \n
With the beauty of his mother, \n
With the courage of his father. \n
"And the boy grew up and prospered, \n
And Osseo, to delight him, \n
Made him little bows and arrows, \n
Opened the great cage of silver, \n
And let loose his aunts and uncles, \n
All those birds with glossy feathers, \n
For his little son to shoot at. \n
"Round and round they wheeled and darted, \n
Filled the Evening Star with music, \n
With their songs of joy and freedom \n
Filled the Evening Star with splendor, \n
With the fluttering of their plumage; \n
Till the boy, the little hunter, \n
Bent his bow and shot an arrow, \n
Shot a swift and fatal arrow, \n
And a bird, with shining feathers, \n
At his feet fell wounded sorely. \n
"But, O wondrous transformation! \n
`T was no bird he saw before him, \n
`T was a beautiful young woman, \n
With the arrow in her bosom! \n
"When her blood fell on the planet, \n
On the sacred Star of Evening, \n
Broken was the spell of magic, \n
Powerless was the strange enchantment, \n
And the youth, the fearless bowman, \n
Suddenly felt himself descending, \n
Held by unseen hands, but sinking \n
Downward through the empty spaces, \n
Downward through the clouds and vapors, \n
Till he rested on an island, \n
On an island, green and grassy, \n
Yonder in the Big-Sea-Water. \n
"After him he saw descending \n
All the birds with shining feathers, \n
Fluttering, falling, wafted downward, \n
Like the painted leaves of Autumn; \n
And the lodge with poles of silver, \n
With its roof like wings of beetles, \n
Like the shining shards of beetles, \n
By the winds of heaven uplifted, \n
Slowly sank upon the island, \n
Bringing back the good Osseo, \n
Bringing Oweenee, the faithful. \n
"Then the birds, again transfigured, \n
Reassumed the shape of mortals, \n
Took their shape, but not their stature; \n
They remained as Little People, \n
Like the pygmies, the Puk-Wudjies, \n
And on pleasant nights of Summer, \n
When the Evening Star was shining, \n
Hand in hand they danced together \n
On the island's craggy headlands, \n
On the sand-beach low and level. \n
"Still their glittering lodge is seen there, \n
On the tranquil Summer evenings, \n
And upon the shore the fisher \n
Sometimes hears their happy voices, \n
Sees them dancing in the starlight !" \n
When the story was completed, \n
When the wondrous tale was ended, \n
Looking round upon his listeners, \n
Solemnly Iagoo added: \n
"There are great men, I have known such, \n
Whom their people understand not, \n
Whom they even make a jest of, \n
Scoff and jeer at in derision. \n
From the story of Osseo \n
Let us learn the fate of jesters!" \n
All the wedding guests delighted \n
Listened to the marvellous story, \n
Listened laughing and applauding, \n
And they whispered to each other: \n
"Does he mean himself, I wonder? \n
And are we the aunts and uncles?" \n
Then again sang Chibiabos, \n
Sang a song of love and longing, \n
In those accents sweet and tender, \n
In those tones of pensive sadness, \n
Sang a maiden's lamentation \n
For her lover, her Algonquin. \n
"When I think of my beloved, \n
Ah me! think of my beloved, \n
When my heart is thinking of him, \n
O my sweetheart, my Algonquin! \n
"Ah me! when I parted from him, \n
Round my neck he hung the wampum, \n
As a pledge, the snow-white wampum, \n
O my sweetheart, my Algonquin! \n
"`I will go with you, he whispered, \n
Ah me! to your native country; \n
Let me go with you, he whispered, \n
O my sweetheart, my Algonquin! \n
"Far away, away, I answered, \n
Very far away, I answered, \n
Ah me! is my native country, \n
O my sweetheart, my Algonquin! \n
"When I looked back to behold him, \n
Where we parted, to behold him, \n
After me he still was gazing, \n
O my sweetheart, my Algonquin! \n
"By the tree he still was standing, \n
By the fallen tree was standing, \n
That had dropped into the water, \n
O my sweetheart, my Algonquin! \n
"When I think of my beloved, \n
Ah me! think of my beloved, \n
When my heart is thinking of him, \n
O my sweetheart, my Algonquin!" \n
Such was Hiawatha's Wedding, \n
Such the dance of Pau-Puk-Keewis, \n
Such the story of Iagoo, \n
Such the songs of Chibiabos; \n
Thus the wedding banquet ended, \n
And the wedding guests departed, \n
Leaving Hiawatha happy \n
With the night and Minnehaha. \n<|endoftext|>

The morning was fearful at sea-- \n
The voyagers weary and pale; \n
Their steamer a wreck, from keel to deck, \n
Before an Autumnal gale. \n
Old Neptune came forth in power-- \n
He wore on his features a frown; \n
And many a guest he took to rest, \n
When the "Evening Star" went down. \n
They sleep in a fathomless grave, \n
The guest and the mariner brave; \n
They pillow their heads on coral beds, \n
Beneath the blue ocean waves, \n
Beneath the blue ocean waves. \n
Sail'd ever a ship from her quay, \n
So heavily laden as she, \n
With folly and fame, with hope and shame, \n
With vanity, mirth and glee? \n
But in the dark moment that came, \n
How useless were rank and renown! \n
And honors of earth, what were they worth, \n
When the "Evening Star" went down. \n
The treacherous ocean is calm-- \n
No longer in storm billows toss's; \n
Yet darkness and cloud will long enshroud \n
The hearts that were link'd with the lost. \n
In how many, how many homes, \n
Far distant, in country or town, \n
A light was put out, in dread, in doubt, \n
When the "Evening Star" when down. \n<|endoftext|>

And then anon she doth herself divest \n
Of all her radiant garments, and reclines \n
Behind the sombre screen of yonder pines, \n
With slumber and soft dreams of love oppressed. \n
O my beloved, my sweet Hesperus! \n
My morning and my evening star of love! \n
My best and gentlest lady! even thus, \n

Once upon a shining star, \n
I made a wish and it came true. \n
I wished for someone for me to love, \n
and then I was loving you. \n
You quickly became my everything, \n
my hopes my desires and my dreams. \n
Though we had our share of problems, \n
they were never as bad as they seemed. \n
But apparently they were bad enough, \n
you decided to part and go your own way. \n
Life for me has been an empty void, \n
since I couldn't convince you to stay. \n
In all my life I have seen so much, \n
I never imagined there could be more. \n
But trying to face each day without you, \n
is the toughest thing I've had to endure. \n
The saddest part about you being gone, \n
is that I no longer have my trusted friend. \n
I guess I always thought you would stay, \n
and we'd be together until the end. \n
So today I'm searching for another star, \n
one that I can wish upon once more. \n
I'll wish for you to come back to me, \n
to be the lover and friend I so adore. \n

A star in any other dialect remains a star \n
Stars give hope for a pleasant night \n
As they retract into their cocoon \n
They pave way for a pleasant daylight \n
They leave promises that they will be back \n
And we gaze at them as they vanish \n
I have a star that guides me \n
In matters of life and love \n
The star depicts humility \n
The star depicts soberness \n
The star is promising \n
The star is bright \n
With a little excitement \n
Do stars get wet when it rains? \n
May be in a shower in socks \n
When star-heart throbs faster \n
In ecstasy and the joy \n
of conquering the world of the sky \n
We love stars \n
For stars have a biblical symbol \n
Of a journey led by God \n
And my star is led by God \n
To a destination where it shall meet a heavenly moon \n
My star, my life, my love, my anchor and my morning blessing. \n<|endoftext|>
star \n
I see a wishing star up in the sky, \n
I start to make a wish upon that wishing star, \n
Which was so beauitful in my eyes, \n
but by the time I'd finished the wish, \n
The wishing star was starting to move away in the sky, \n
So I dipped my eyes & turned away, \n
For someone else to have a wish, \n
On that wishing star. \n<|endoftext|>

The leading man walked onto the stage, \n
the house lights dimmed, a hush descended, \n
the play was about to begin. \n
A drama, powerful and dramatic. \n
Breaths were held, not one body moved. \n
Suddenly, he spoke. \n
'Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm afraid to have to inform you, \n
that our leading lady has been struck down by laryngitis, \n
therefore, the show is cancelled'. \n
Mumblings, rumblings, getting louder and louder. \n
'Not good enough' shouted someone. \n
'Sit down and shut up', shouted another. \n
Uproar! Pandemonium! \n
'Where's the understudy then? ' came from a third. \n
'She's also indisposed, I'm sorry to say', but your money \n
will be refunded in the foyer'. \n
'I know the part', a voice called from way down in the orchestra pit. \n
'If you'll give me a minute, \n
I'll go and change, and this show can start'. \n
Everyone sat down in amazement! '. \n
This small tiny girl, was bravely taking on the big leading role. \n
A hush descended in the auditorium, \n
and the curtains parted. \n
As the finale ended, there was a standing ovation. \n
The audience were thrilled. \n
The girl took a bow. \n
The orchestra played 'God Save The Queen' \n
and everyone clapped and cheered. \n
For here on this stage, this night, a star was born! \n

A birthday poem for my wife \n
A star fell from heaven \n
Into my arms last night \n
As we walked arm in arm \n
Under a cloudy moonlight \n
Now heavens missing an angel \n
Because I’m holding her tight \n
You came into my life \n
Like the first ray of the sun \n
And I knew right away \n
That you were the one \n
There were no need for words \n
Just a small simple smile \n
My heart fluttered \n
With coming of the dawn \n
Because like the stars \n
I hoped you wouldn’t be gone \n
I wanted you there at my side \n
As each day fades to into night \n
I wanted you here \n
As my lover and wife \n
Your not going back \n
I won’t let you go \n
I love you too much \n
To ever let you go \n<|endoftext|>
star \n
He walks like a lover: mysterious and wise \n
chestnut hair hides two hazel eyes \n
leaving girls in his wake begging for more— \n
cause to him it's just the thrill of the lure. \n
He stares at you across the bar— \n
seductively undressing from afar; \n
you take the bait as he reels you in \n
thinking, 'I bet this guy always wins.' \n
something obscured in his character \n
I hypothesize an 'X' factor. \n
Pleasure floods your inner voice \n
that would-a otherwise made a sensible choice. \n
Your desire compounds his scheming loath— \n
there's a common thread that runs in you both. \n
You live for the craving of right now— \n
don't hesitate to seize or even ask how, \n
for it's over before it begins \n
and you're left alone with passion's sins. \n
What is it about him that excites to the core \n
while he's busy calculating his next score? \n
It's got to be hidden somewhere in the confide: \n
you've never been so satisfied. \n
It's not what he says but how he kisses down there— \n
how he stares and fights to care \n
that makes you believe you're one of the lucky ones \n
—or is it he's learned the innocent give better runs? \n
something obscured in his character \n
one guess it could be the Rock Star factor. \n
It wasn't even charm that made you falter— \n
I wouldn't be surprised if his words were chartered. \n
It was rather that he left all baggage at the claim \n
giving an illusion of a boy wildly untamed. \n
Where'd you get the notion: youth is invincible \n
defying your every previous principle? \n
It was his vulnerability— \n
it was too damn irresistable. \n
'Don't search too long or you'll end up alone' \n
is a piece of advice that should be ground like a stone \n
for aren't we all in this game of fishing \n
endlessly searching—for what we think is missing? \n
Heartbreak on the sleeve and confidence at the collar \n
is a recipe for the fiercest desire. \n
He keeps a record of his former ties— \n
truth in fact, he hates goodbyes. \n
At last I conclude indefinitely: \n
—whether or not it was worth it to me, \n
the something obscured in his character \n
is most certainly the Rock Star Factor. \n<|endoftext|>
star \n
If winter, you wake up at four \n
From behind the closed window-door, \n
Whilst struggling to fight wintry chill, \n
I'm tucked in my cosy bed still. \n
At six no sun still, nor dawn's clout \n
But day's diurnal reign's not in doubt, \n
Dawn slowly shows up crimson red, \n
Reluctant I stir in my bed. \n
But you still rule early dawn's sky \n
Heedless of that cockerel cry \n
Announcing the reign of the sun, \n
And at that rooster's rant you yawn. \n
Seven, you nearly kiss zenith, \n
Whilst sun shows its bright tip beneath, \n
And prepares to rule all the day, \n
You curtail your magical sway. \n
And when at tall zenith you set— \n
Not that life's horizon you met, \n
We of East whilst give you a pat, \n
In West perhaps they doff their hat. \n
O brightest morning star, Venus, \n
As twilight star you're loved no less. \n
Venus stands out in skies— either as a morning star at times or an evening star at other times of the year. \n

graduation \n
Graduation Day is the climax of a dream. \n
A parental dream that began when a child is born, \n
And their hope come true it would seem, \n
A triumph held after periods of forlorn, \n
A feeling of pride and euphoria years away \n
For a daughter or son - Graduation Day. \n
It is a peak of success for the graduate, \n
Not only for the graduate but parents too. \n
A joyful event after many years they had to wait, \n
Realizing the glorious thrill of a dream come true, \n
A genuine smile accompanied by a deep sigh, \n
Often a handkerchief in hand as the class goes by. \n
Graduation is a deserving, hard earned goal \n
With mortarboard and gown as foretold, \n
A gratifying service of the mind and soul \n
In a simple and beautiful sheepskin told \n
That the graduate fulfilled the educational rule. \n
At last, for the mother and father, a dream come true. \n
Graduation Day! \n<|endoftext|>

For me to sit and say 'I wont miss this old place' \n

I dont know any place that i'd rather be. \n

The people you'll meet and the places you'll go \n

The path of life before them lies \n
as elated graduates take stride. \n
Parents' eyes focused on their footsteps \n
as they listen to ceremonial music with pride. \n
Graduates know not yet their future. \n
They only know they will hopefully soar.. \n
These graduates, a product of a school \n
that they now will cherish even more. \n
Parents watch as a son/daughter embarks on life, \n
their endeavors and what they will be. \n
They wait for days with an anxious wonderment, \n
A graduates future long to see. \n
One should appreciate the gift of graduation, \n
and wisely choose an occupation or professional plan, \n
For in the end, a graduate will mighty be, \n
but now must rest in another hand. \n<|endoftext|>

Rushing at me, \n

Soon, \n

I'll start a new story, \n
leave the old one behind. \n
Bring my favorite chapters with me, \n
leave the others alone. \n
When it comes then goes, I'll begin wondering, \n
what I'll do when I'm older. \n
I'll be happy it's finally over, until, \n
I'm realizing I'm crying, \n
my tears coming from the part of me who doesn't want to let go. \n
That doesn't want to leave behind all that's surrounded it for years, \n
But then, I'll remember all that's ahead of me, \n
an untold story waiting to be written still. \n
So, with a heavy heart, I'll move on, \n
Take my huge last step to the end, \n
and take my first step into my new beginning. \n
And experience a day, \n
my day, \n
called graduation. \n<|endoftext|>

Congratulate Kelly, on your graduation. \n
After four years of studies, you graduated from Dental school! \n
Now you have your license to practice \n
But you prefer more training in your sub-specialty. \n
You'll spend two more years in school \n
And you'll accumulate more astronomical debts! \n
This week, you made a trip to Philadelphia. \n
You visited new school with your mother and brother. \n
Next two years you will be a resident at Penn Dental school \n
To receive special training in orthodontics. \n
You'll pay expensive rent these years. \n
Fortunately, your classmate shares one half of the rent. \n
So now, you can put your mind to study hard. \n
Two years from now, you'll graduate from this ivy school to enter your practice. \n
Thank you for visiting me and your aunt. \n
As a small gift to you, this poem is our congratulations. \n

graduation \n
A day to part \n
Away from scholarly books \n
And mind boggling journals \n
Running words and trawling letters \n
Leaving behind the assignments \n
And examinations. \n
Graduation day \n
A fulfillment of recognition \n
Granted to measure the tough journey \n
Traveled in months and years \n
Browsing pages of papers \n
Now, insignificantly lie somewhere. \n
The sleepless nights \n
The restless moments \n
All have vanished with the crown \n
Received on this day. \n
A lot of happy smiles \n
And tears exchanged \n
During these periods, \n
But all joined together \n
To commemorate the hardship endured \n
To beat many through the journey \n
And come out the best among many. \n
The fear of losing the battle \n
And the agony of anticipation \n
Are all but flimsy tattles \n
Of this illusive mind \n
But never mind \n
There are no exams to mind, anymore, \n
at least for sometime. \n
Be ready to climb one more ladder \n
Make it your priceless ambition. \n
I wish you all the best, buddy \n

A castle drawbridge with banners flying above it, the backdrop \n

Announcements, Star Spangled Banner, Pledge of Allegiance, and noted \n
teachers making their speeches. \n
At last, students standing row by row, single file, waiting for \n
their names of distinction to be called. \n
An eternity goes by, then suddenly my son is standing, walking, \n
waiting to be called onto the imaginary red carpet, as he strides \n
proudly across the walkway suspended slightly in the air. \n
Then it happens, they call his name, mispronounce it, but my son \n
walks without any hesitation or break in stride, to receive his \n
diploma, his moment in the spotlight. \n
Tears in my eyes, I quietly clap with dignity for my son, I \n
couldn't be prouder, my love for him overflowing. \n
Such a joyous moment in the life of a Mother, there are no words \n
to express how proud I am of him. \n
This moment in time reminding me of past moments in his life when \n
I was proud to be his Mother. \n
And now, once again, he has touched my life with his achievement \n
and I can only say, so humbly, how very proud I am, to be his \n
Mother. \n

hate \n
It’s almost midnight on a Tuesday. \n
he sits on his bed and thinks of what he’s gonna say— \n
half a case of beer bottles scattered around in diligent dismay. \n
he’s not a coward. \n
he’s just lonely. \n
so much pain runs through his veins; \n
the scars on his wrists prove his humility \n
for when he lost his lover, the life he’d built, and part of his family. \n
confident in his wits— \n
he picks up the phone and dials the digits; \n
reciting them by heart he’s feeling inspired, clever, and wise— \n
regretfully remembering how he’s always had them memorized. \n
he's mad to love \n
she's mad to hate. \n
he wants to create \n
she wants to annihilate. \n
she’s not lonely. \n
she’s just a coward. \n
so much fear runs through her veins; \n
the scars on her wrists prove her vanity \n
for when she turned in her life ungratefully. \n
laying back-down on her bed— \n
she’s thinking of all the better men she’s scored; \n
her phone rings and she’s caught in her deplore. \n
he pours his heart out before he can think: \n
racing thoughts dipped in mental ink. \n
he whispers words reserved for a lovers’ dance \n
and begs her to give him half-a-fucking-chance; \n
for he believes he’s only half-the-man now— \n
despite the newly dug furrows in his brow. \n
I must be crazed to deny him; \n
no girl in her sane mind would let this tension unwind. \n
unraveling like a mummy from the grave— \n
he lets honesty and candor flood the airwaves. \n
you see it’s been a year since they've talked; \n
she said she’d already accepted that he’d pass her by. \n
she doesn’t believe in come-back-around’s: \n
you’ve got one shot with one person till you’re dead in the ground. \n
he’s exhausted now— \n
the last of the beer syllables have endowed. \n
every emotion displayed on his face \n
he feels worn in the way you feel after running a 3 mi race. \n
she’s on the other end wishing he’d begin again— \n
but of arrogance or defense— \n
instead she responds, \n
“I don’t want to be responsible for your depression; \n
I have enough on my chest by way of confession.” \n
she feels like hell \n
he feels like heaven \n
cause he knows he’s a creator \n
and she’s a destroyer. \n
he's mad to love \n
she's mad to hate. \n
take it twice \n
and reverberate. \n

Hate is the opposite of love. \n
These emotions are powerful. \n

Discrimination is a cause of hate. \n

It is indeed a powerful word hate. \n
Hate brings on Anxiety \n
Anxiety leads to fear. \n
Fear brings on anger. \n
Anger leads to suffering. \n
Suffering causes death. \n
This feeling is dark and dreadful. \n
Hate is represented by the color black. \n
Such a dark deep color like hate. \n
In the dictionary there are too many words that mean hate. \n

Ouch, to cut my finger... \n
Pain and blood spills and does longly stay and linger. \n
To give my sliced append-aged digit a much needed bath... \n
I won't cook for a living, or go to school for typing or even take math. \n
Math and onions i do not like... \n
I'd rather have a tooth pulled or be super glued to a seat-less one peddled \n

this site was perfect...just perfect..it felt like home \n

refute, argue, agree accordingly \n
but to never never hate personally \n
the poser...why because it's not my place \n
to judge people i don't really know so well \n
I do rant when poked and provoked \n
but i don't go chasing the hater \n

Deafening my sense of certainty \n
With your hurt \n
I hate it when glass shatters \n
Leaving pieces of my sanity splattered \n
On white carpets and Formica cabinets \n
And when the roof has caved in and crashes over my head \n
Crumbling down to my nail marred feet \n
I sweep it neatly up \n
And hide it darkened corners \n
With all the other forgotten martyrs \n
Left praying for the worlds sins \n
In a pool of crimson \n
I hate how you make me hate myself \n
Eroding and excavating my goodness \n
With your foolishness \n
False pride mixed with alcoholic breath \n
Triggering my gage reflexes with your familiar \n
Sour stench \n
I hate to love you \n
Every single vessel that allows you to be \n
Every tiny molecule \n
Atom and cell \n

Thinking that you are mine, \n

And they told me but i didn't believe, \n

But i heard nothing, trying to achieve, \n

if people lied to me, will so my eyes? \n
How was i so blind? \n
and hiding from all those lies. \n
I guess that no words are enough, \n

I thought i am your only love, \n

Can't help but to stare at you, \n

Can't help but to hate you, \n

Seeking a shoulder to cry on... \n
And a pat on their backs! \n
Blinded they are like fools on crack. \n

But losing themselves... \n
With weakened backbones attacked! \n

With a love to hate! \n
Berating unappreciated wisdom at stake! \n<|endoftext|>

What slight misunderstanding, view of self, \n

Where was that childhood friend you loved, called 'God', \n

don't be shy of unkindness, either \n

Still sometimes I just don't know what to do \n
What I go through isn't a matter of doubt \n

so I wonder if you're in love \n
Because to trust in someone with every trace of your being \n
Without seeing or hearing or even fearing the worst \n
Looking through what hurts to just put all your trust in me \n
and without that it's hard for me to believe \n
That this will last eternally \n
Now don't get me wrong and certainly don't count me out \n
Without a doubt I have so much hope and I trust that \n
You will trust in me eventually. maybe you just don't see \n

caresses stop too soon, \n

without pressure, \n
without limits? \n
Is this real love at last, \n

a better liar than the others? \n

Well, some kids bring money to school, don't they? \n
Dunno... \n

Who Can You Trust? \n
Who Can you trust in the world today? \n
Your friends? \n
They'll be just as trifling as your enemy \n
When you are stuck at a dead end \n
Who can you trust in the world today? \n
Your blood? \n
Blood is thicker than water \n
Don't let this be your rule \n
By this same rule was I fooled. \n
Who can you trust in the world today? \n
Your instructors? \n
Their job is to teach not to care \n
Your problems will appear just as thin as air. \n
Who can you trust in the world today? \n
Those who inforce and carry out the law? \n
This is where the world tears \n
They should be the ones we fear \n
Who can your trust in the world today? \n
Don't put your emotions up on a shelf \n
Trust no one but yourself! \n<|endoftext|>

Father, part of his double interest \n
Unto thy kingdom, thy Son gives to me, \n
His jointure in the knotty Trinity \n
He keeps, and gives to me his death's conquest. \n
This Lamb, whose death with life the world hath blest, \n
Was from the world's beginning slain, and he \n
Hath made two Wills which with the Legacy \n
Of his and thy kingdom do thy Sons invest. \n
Yet such are thy laws that men argue yet \n
Whether a man those statutes can fulfil; \n
None doth; but all-healing grace and spirit \n
Revive again what law and letter kill. \n
Thy law's abridgement, and thy last command \n

father \n
Come up from the fields, father, here's a letter from our Pete; \n
And come to the front door, mother-here's a letter from thy dear \n
son. \n
Lo, 'tis autumn; \n
Lo, where the trees, deeper green, yellower and redder, \n
Cool and sweeten Ohio's villages, with leaves fluttering in the \n
moderate wind; \n
Where apples ripe in the orchards hang, and grapes on the trellis'd \n
vines; \n
(Smell you the smell of the grapes on the vines? \n
Smell you the buckwheat, where the bees were lately buzzing?) \n
Above all, lo, the sky, so calm, so transparent after the rain, and \n
with wondrous clouds; \n
Below, too, all calm, all vital and beautiful-and the farm prospers \n
well. 10 \n
Down in the fields all prospers well; \n
But now from the fields come, father-come at the daughter's call; \n
And come to the entry, mother-to the front door come, right away. \n
Fast as she can she hurries-something ominous-her steps trembling; \n
She does not tarry to smoothe her hair, nor adjust her cap. \n
Open the envelope quickly; \n
O this is not our son's writing, yet his name is sign'd; \n
O a strange hand writes for our dear son-O stricken mother's soul! \n
All swims before her eyes-flashes with black-she catches the main \n
words only; \n
Sentences broken-gun-shot wound in the breast, cavalry skirmish, \n
taken to hospital, 20 \n
At present low, but will soon be better. \n
Ah, now, the single figure to me, \n
Amid all teeming and wealthy Ohio, with all its cities and farms, \n
Sickly white in the face, and dull in the head, very faint, \n
By the jamb of a door leans. \n
Grieve not so, dear mother, (the just-grown daughter speaks through \n
her sobs; \n
The little sisters huddle around, speechless and dismay'd ;) \n
See, dearest mother, the letter says Pete will soon be better. \n
Alas, poor boy, he will never be better, (nor may-be needs to be \n
better, that brave and simple soul ;) \n
While they stand at home at the door, he is dead already; 30 \n
The only son is dead. \n
But the mother needs to be better; \n
She, with thin form, presently drest in black; \n
By day her meals untouch'd-then at night fitfully sleeping, often \n
waking, \n
In the midnight waking, weeping, longing with one deep longing, \n
O that she might withdraw unnoticed-silent from life, escape and \n
withdraw, \n
To follow, to seek, to be with her dear dead son. \n<|endoftext|>

"My times are in Thy hand." -- Psalm XXXI.15 \n
Father, I know that all my life \n
Is portioned out for me, \n
And the changes that are sure to come, \n
I do not fear to see; \n
But I ask Thee for a present mind \n
Intent on pleasing Thee. \n
I ask Thee for a thoughtful love, \n
Through constant watching wise, \n
To meet the glad with joyful smiles, \n
And to wipe the weeping eyes; \n
And a heart at leisure from itself, \n
To soothe and sympathise. \n
I would not have the restless will \n
That hurries to and fro, \n
Seeking for some great thing to do \n
Or secret thing to know; \n
I would be treated as a child, \n
And guided where I go. \n
Wherever in the world I am, \n
In whatsoe'er estate, \n
I have a fellowship with hearts \n
To keep and cultivate; \n
And a work of lowly love to do \n
For the Lord on whom I wait. \n
So I ask Thee for the daily strength, \n
To none that ask denied, \n
And a mind to blend with outward life \n
While keeping at Thy side; \n
Content to fill a little space, \n
If Thou be glorified. \n
And if some things I do not ask, \n
In my cup of blessing be, \n
I would have my spirit filled the more \n
With grateful love to Thee -- \n
More careful -- not to serve Thee much, \n
But to please Thee perfectly. \n
There are briers besetting every path, \n
That call for patient care; \n
There is a cross in every lot, \n
And an earnest need for prayer; \n
But a lowly heart that leans on Thee \n
Is happy anywhere. \n
In a service which Thy will appoints, \n
There are no bonds for me, \n
For my inmost heart is taught "the truth" \n
That makes Thy children "free;" \n
And a life of self-renouncing love \n
Is a life of liberty. \n<|endoftext|>

I was \n

She'd always smile: \n
'Thank you Danny! ' \n
'That's alright love \n

These the ritualistic words \n

Then he'd teach the clock \n

adjusting it with his hands \n

There once was a fellow named Bart \n
he declared Father Death to be art \n
when the knock finally came \n
and death called out his name \n
he said, please, just one last farewell fart. \n
Father Death had ignored this small plea \n
Bart was home that was easy to see \n
when the loudest of farts \n
and it had to be Bart's \n
blew the reaper right down on his knee. \n
When the reaper is utterly humbled \n
and his job has been thoroughly bumbled \n
he will have to retreat \n
while admitting defeat \n
Bart was scared and he farted and mumbled. \n
So it is the olfactory nerve \n
that's the weak spot, it gives us new verve \n
so when Father death knocks \n
quickly strip off your socks \n
let him have it, say: 'Happy to serve.' \n
If collateral fallout disturbs you \n
a discloloured pyjama perturbs, too \n
then you don't wear a frown \n
but a wide open gown \n
it's what 'DEATH-I-WILL-FART' people must do. \n<|endoftext|>

He was always there, my father, \n
constant as gravity. \n
And photogenic too, \n
with scrubbed square hands \n
and a pugnacious Roman profile. \n
He looked just like Henry XIII. \n
His surgery was his kingdom \n
and he ruled over his patients \n
with firm benevolence \n
and a twinkle in his pale blue eyes. \n
As children we didn't see much of him \n
- mum made sure of that - \n
but he was always there, \n
dependable as the Herald Sun. \n
He adored mum with fierce, \n
uncomplicated tenderness \n
and they fought long and hard \n
(mostly about me) . \n
He used to stamp his feet \n
(literally) over trivial things, \n
yet when the final diagnosis came, \n
he took it in his stride. \n
Latterly he grew thin and grey \n
and lost his colonel's moustache, \n
but he always enjoyed his glass of red \n
and watched the Channel 2 news every night. \n
My last picture of him \n
was a pair of pretty feet \n
at the end of a hospital bed... \n<|endoftext|>

Dear Lord in Heaven, I hear your voice in the sounds of the falling rain. \n
I feel you Lord when the warm winds touch my face \n

When no one else is near me Lord, I know you are standing by. \n
When I’m weak Father, you give me strength and when I’m blind \n
Father you find a way to make me see. \n
You are the wind that whispers through the swishing of trees, \n
the quiet still that lingers in the open sea. \n
You are the roar of thunder before the great rains fall. \n
You are the spring, summer, winter and fall. \n
My dear Father you are everything, you are my all. \n
The King of kings Lord, you sit on the great throne, \n
the giver of love and the taker of pain. \n
Father I will continue to worship you again and again. \n
I love you Father with all my heart and soul, \n
without you Father I would not be whole. \n
I ask Father God, that you stay within my heart \n
and walk with me to the end of my days. \n
When you take me Father to cross that threshold \n

The green-white privet flower, the spotted stone, \n
And all that welcomes the rain; the sparrow too,— \n
Who watches with a hard eye from seclusion, \n
Beneath the elm-tree bough, till rain is done. \n
There is an oriole who, upside down, \n
Hangs at his nest, and flicks an orange wing,— \n
Under a tree as dead and still as lead; \n
There is a single leaf, in all this heaven \n
Of leaves, which rain has loosened from its twig: \n
The stem breaks, and it falls, but it is caught \n
Upon a sister leaf, and thus she hangs; \n
There is an acorn cup, beside a mushroom \n
Which catches three drops from the stooping cloud. \n
The timid bee goes back to the hive; the fly \n
Under the broad leaf of the hollyhock \n
Perpends stupid with cold; the raindark snail \n
Surveys the wet world from a watery stone... \n
And still the syllables of water whisper: \n
The wheel of cloud whirs slowly: while we wait \n
In the dark room; and in your heart I find \n
One silver raindrop,—on a hawthorn leaf,— \n
Orion in a cobweb, and the World. \n<|endoftext|>

Till the treacherous pool \n
Ingulfs them in its whirling \n
And turbulent ocean. \n
In the country, on every side, \n
Where far and wide, \n
Like a leopard's tawny and spotted hide, \n
Stretches the plain, \n
To the dry grass and the drier grain \n
How welcome is the rain! \n
In the furrowed land \n
The toilsome and patient oxen stand; \n
Lifting the yoke encumbered head, \n
With their dilated nostrils spread, \n
They silently inhale \n
The clover-scented gale, \n
And the vapors that arise \n
From the well-watered and smoking soil. \n
For this rest in the furrow after toil \n
Their large and lustrous eyes \n
Seem to thank the Lord, \n
More than man's spoken word. \n
Near at hand, \n
From under the sheltering trees, \n
The farmer sees \n
His pastures, and his fields of grain, \n
As they bend their tops \n
To the numberless beating drops \n
Of the incessant rain. \n
He counts it as no sin \n
That he sees therein \n
Only his own thrift and gain. \n
These, and far more than these, \n
The Poet sees! \n
He can behold \n
Aquarius old \n
Walking the fenceless fields of air; \n
And from each ample fold \n
Of the clouds about him rolled \n
Scattering everywhere \n
The showery rain, \n
As the farmer scatters his grain. \n
He can behold \n
Things manifold \n
That have not yet been wholly told,-- \n
Have not been wholly sung nor said. \n
For his thought, that never stops, \n
Follows the water-drops \n
Down to the graves of the dead, \n
Down through chasms and gulfs profound, \n
To the dreary fountain-head \n
Of lakes and rivers under ground; \n
And sees them, when the rain is done, \n
On the bridge of colors seven \n
Climbing up once more to heaven, \n
Opposite the setting sun. \n
Thus the Seer, \n
With vision clear, \n
Sees forms appear and disappear, \n
In the perpetual round of strange, \n
Mysterious change \n
From birth to death, from death to birth, \n
From earth to heaven, from heaven to earth; \n
Till glimpses more sublime \n
Of things, unseen before, \n
Unto his wondering eyes reveal \n
The Universe, as an immeasurable wheel \n
Turning forevermore \n
In the rapid and rushing river of Time. \n<|endoftext|>
rain \n
Rain, torrential rain lashing, \n
It ran down my neck making my collar \n
Damp and sticky drippy wet. \n
I cannot brush it aside or hide \n
From its attack for it is relentless. \n
It splashes around my feet \n
As I walk Clara around the lake. \n
The car seats will be wet again \n
From a summer, autumn and winter \n
Of relentless rain hammering down \n
As if the saturated earth depended on it. \n
Waterlogged fields and roofs: Rain dripping \n
From tree branches in big dollops \n
Exploding on the ground in front of me. \n
Even the robins and blackbirds lose, \n
Their voice, their orchestra remain silent. \n
Only the swans and moorhens with \n
Their waterproof jackets seem oblivious \n
And the seagulls mocking all around. \n<|endoftext|>

rain \n
Spring rain \n
leaking through the roof \n
dripping from the wasps' nest. \n
Translated by Robert Hass \n<|endoftext|>
rain \n
call it the greenhouse effect or whatever \n
but it just doesn't rain like it used to. \n
I particularly remember the rains of the \n
depression era. \n
there wasn't any money but there was \n
plenty of rain. \n
it wouldn't rain for just a night or \n
a day, \n
it would RAIN for 7 days and 7 \n
nights \n
and in Los Angeles the storm drains \n
weren't built to carry off taht much \n
water \n
and the rain came down THICK and \n
MEAN and \n
STEADY \n
and you HEARD it banging against \n
the roofs and into the ground \n
waterfalls of it came down \n
from roofs \n
and there was HAIL \n
big ROCKS OF ICE \n
bombing \n
exploding smashing into things \n
and the rain \n
just wouldn't \n
STOP \n
and all the roofs leaked- \n
dishpans, \n
cooking pots \n
were placed all about; \n
they dripped loudly \n
and had to be emptied \n
again and \n
again. \n
the rain came up over the street curbings, \n
across the lawns, climbed up the steps and \n
entered the houses. \n
there were mops and bathroom towels, \n
and the rain often came up through the \n
toilets:bubbling, brown, crazy,whirling, \n
and all the old cars stood in the streets, \n
cars that had problems starting on a \n
sunny day, \n
and the jobless men stood \n
looking out the windows \n
at the old machines dying \n
like living things out there. \n
the jobless men, \n
failures in a failing time \n
were imprisoned in their houses with their \n
wives and children \n
and their \n
pets. \n
the pets refused to go out \n
and left their waste in \n
strange places. \n
the jobless men went mad \n
confined with \n
their once beautiful wives. \n
there were terrible arguments \n
as notices of foreclosure \n
fell into the mailbox. \n
rain and hail, cans of beans, \n
bread without butter; fried \n
eggs, boiled eggs, poached \n
eggs; peanut butter \n
sandwiches, and an invisible \n
chicken in every pot. \n
my father, never a good man \n
at best, beat my mother \n
when it rained \n
as I threw myself \n
between them, \n
the legs, the knees, the \n
screams \n
until they \n
seperated. \n
'I'll kill you,' I screamed \n
at him. 'You hit her again \n
and I'll kill you! ' \n
'Get that son-of-a-bitching \n
kid out of here! ' \n
'no, Henry, you stay with \n
your mother! ' \n
all the households were under \n
seige but I believe that ours \n
held more terror than the \n
average. \n
and at night \n
as we attempted to sleep \n
the rains still came down \n
and it was in bed \n
in the dark \n
watching the moon against \n
the scarred window \n
so bravely \n
holding out \n
most of the rain, \n
I thought of Noah and the \n
Ark \n
and I thought, it has come \n
again. \n
we all thought \n
that. \n
and then, at once, it would \n
stop. \n
and it always seemed to \n
stop \n
around 5 or 6 a.m., \n
peaceful then, \n
but not an exact silence \n
because things continued to \n
drip \n
drip \n
drip \n
and there was no smog then \n
and by 8 a.m. \n
there was a \n
blazing yellow sunlight, \n
Van Gogh yellow- \n
crazy, blinding! \n
and then \n
the roof drains \n
relieved of the rush of \n
water \n
began to expand in the warmth: \n
PANG! PANG! PANG! \n
and everybody got up and looked outside \n
and there were all the lawns \n
still soaked \n
greener than green will ever \n
be \n
and there were birds \n
on the lawn \n
CHIRPING like mad, \n
they hadn't eaten decently \n
for 7 days and 7 nights \n
and they were weary of \n
berries \n
and \n
they waited as the worms \n
rose to the top, \n
half drowned worms. \n
the birds plucked them \n
up \n
and gobbled them \n
down; there were \n
blackbirds and sparrows. \n
the blackbirds tried to \n
drive the sparrows off \n
but the sparrows, \n
maddened with hunger, \n
smaller and quicker, \n
got their \n
due. \n
the men stood on their porches \n
smoking cigarettes, \n
now knowing \n
they'd have to go out \n
there \n
to look for that job \n
that probably wasn't \n
there, to start that car \n
that probably wouldn't \n
start. \n
and the once beautiful \n
wives \n
stood in their bathrooms \n
combing their hair, \n
applying makeup, \n
trying to put their world back \n
together again, \n
trying to forget that \n
awful sadness that \n
gripped them, \n
wondering what they could \n
fix for \n
breakfast. \n
and on the radio \n
we were told that \n
school was now \n
open. \n
and \n
soon \n
there I was \n
on the way to school, \n
massive puddles in the \n
street, \n
the sun like a new \n
world, \n
my parents back in that \n
house, \n
I arrived at my classroom \n
on time. \n
Mrs. Sorenson greeted us \n
with, 'we won't have our \n
usual recess, the grounds \n
are too wet.' \n
'AW! ' most of the boys \n
went. \n
'but we are going to do \n
something special at \n
recess,' she went on, \n
'and it will be \n
fun! ' \n
well, we all wondered \n
what that would \n
be \n
and the two hour wait \n
seemed a long time \n
as Mrs.Sorenson \n
went about \n
teaching her \n
lessons. \n
I looked at the little \n
girls, they looked so \n
pretty and clean and \n
alert, \n
they sat still and \n
straight \n
and their hair was \n
beautiful \n
in the California \n
sunshine. \n
the the recess bells rang \n
and we all waited for the \n
fun. \n
then Mrs. Sorenson told us: \n
'now, what we are going to \n
do is we are going to tell \n
each other what we did \n
during the rainstorm! \n
we'll begin in the front row \n
and go right around! \n
now, Michael, you're first! ...' \n
well, we all began to tell \n
our stories, Michael began \n
and it went on and on, \n
and soon we realized that \n
we were all lying, not \n
exactly lying but mostly \n
lying and some of the boys \n
began to snicker and some \n
of the girls began to give \n
them dirty looks and \n
Mrs.Sorenson said, \n
'all right! I demand a \n
modicum of silence \n
here! \n
I am interested in what \n
you did \n
during the rainstorm \n
even if you \n
aren't! ' \n
so we had to tell our \n
stories and they were \n
stories. \n
one girl said that \n
when the rainbow first \n
came \n
she saw God's face \n
at the end of it. \n
only she didn't say which end. \n
one boy said he stuck \n
his fishing pole \n
out the window \n
and caught a little \n
fish \n
and fed it to his \n
cat. \n
almost everybody told \n
a lie. \n
the truth was just \n
too awful and \n
embarassing to tell. \n
then the bell rang \n
and recess was \n
over. \n
'thank you,' said Mrs. \n
Sorenson, 'that was very \n
nice. \n
and tomorrow the grounds \n
will be dry \n
and we will put them \n
to use \n
again.' \n
most of the boys \n
cheered \n
and the little girls \n
sat very straight and \n
still, \n
looking so pretty and \n
clean and \n
alert, \n
their hair beautiful in a sunshine that \n
the world might never see \n
again. \n

The scared soldier dashed back to the fort \n
He had witnessed enough \n
He had only went to 'experience' war \n
And now he wanted to go home desperately \n
He had made friends, lifelong they were \n
Good people \n
Then came the battles \n
The first six didn't take any of his best friends, only people he knew \n
But that last one took Charlie \n
Charlie was his most treasured friend \n
But Charlie was slowly dying \n
A painful death \n
Back at the lines was Charlie \n
Lying helpless in a pool of blood \n
Surrounded by bodies \n
That were badly mangled as his \n

To take refuge at the fort \n
Where most of the 'bravest' men had escaped to \n
Or risk his life for his new friend \n

'Cry Freedom, ' he declared boldly \n

And the man was thrown to his friend's side on the ground \n

freedom \n
Freedom, oh precious freedom, we ask not why we hold it so dear \n
we just take it, \n
for freedom is like a sweet laughter within your soul. \n
It's like a soft gentle breeze on an autumn afternoon, \n
when all is right with the world. \n
Freedom is the flame that burns down within our souls, \n
Can the flames burn within the souls of all, \n
or must the flames be drowned with tears of sorrow and pain? \n
For I shall not pass through this life in vain. \n
Let freedom warm the souls of all mankind, \n
for as I walk in the autumn of my life, I shall reflect \n
on my yesterdays and hope for our tomorrows. \n
For the reflections of our lives are like looking through \n
an hourglass of everlasting time, all moments are cherished. \n
Oh let us listen and embrace the souls on fire, \n
all souls are cherished. \n<|endoftext|>

FREEDOM IS..., FREEDOM IS NEVER \n
Melvin Banggollay \n
FREEDOM IS: \n
F-ighting for a just and noble cause \n
R-especting others rights and dignity \n
E-xchanging of views without fear \n
E-mpowring others to be free from tyrany. \n
D-oing morally rightful and lawful things \n
O-ffering others opportunity to live descent life \n
M-utual sharing as brothers and sisters. \n
for FREEDOM IS NEVER \n
F-ighting to deprive others rights \n
R-aping the right and dignity of anyone \n
E-xploiting the ignorance and weakness of others \n
E-xperimenting others life for an immoral cause \n
D-irect assault of one's private life in disguise of freedom \n
O-utliving others with the power of guns and goons \n
M-utual sharing at the expense of the weak and many. \n<|endoftext|>

To have my own mind, without others trying to influence me. \n

“A Free India” - That was your only passion \n
Thanks to your sacrifices, today we are an independent nation. \n
You all were quite intelligent and hardworking \n
And could have easily led the life of a king \n
But you chose the life of danger and struggle \n
To liberate your motherland from the British government's shackle \n
You relentlessly fought against the world's greatest colonial power \n
And successfully helped to blossom India's independence flower. \n
India will always remain grateful for you peoples' supreme service \n
You are Mother India's golden children, whom we will always miss. \n
(This poem is a tribute to those lion-hearted freedom fighters of India, who got us independence from the British government in 1947) . \n<|endoftext|>

Freedom frees my dictionary \n
In my brain.. I keep the words \n
For every thing serious and real \n
The words that could change my life \n
In my heart.. I keep the words that \n
Describe me when I’m lonely, \n
When I’m happy or sad, \n
When I’m in love or broken \n
In my body.. I keep the words \n
For my health, physics and sex \n
In my soul.. I keep the words that \n
I can give to god \n
And thank him for every thing he gave me \n
Unfortunately I cant use any of those words! ? \n
Because in the last tow years \n
I have lost the word “freedom” from my dictionary \n
It had been captured by the dearest to me.. \n
My freedom is locked in a big cage, full of doors \n
I’ve tried to free my freedom \n
But non of the doors was opening \n
I wanted to tell them release my freedom \n
But I just couldn’t say anything! ! \n
I’m a prisoner because I lost my word “freedom” \n
I’m struggling and fighting inside of me to return my freedom \n
I’m in a war \n
Looking in silence and preying to gad! ! \n
Those are my only weapons to send my freedom free \n
Every night I shed tears \n
But no one can hear me \n
I have lost my freedom \n
And I’m loosing me? ! ? ! \n<|endoftext|>
freedom \n
So many gave their lives \n
To keep our country free \n
But we rarely think about it \n
We treat it so carelessly \n
We go about our daily chores \n
Expecting our freedom to remain \n
We raise our children, go to work \n
Thinking life will be the same \n
But it doesn’t all just happen \n
For when you look back in history \n
Challenges came to the forefront \n
Folks fought hard for victory \n
It seems each generation \n
Has a challenge that must be met \n
Luckily there are special folks \n
Who have goals that are bravely set \n
So let’s all think about them \n
Let’s hold them in high esteem \n
Pray for the strong brave souls \n
And what freedom always brings! \n<|endoftext|>
freedom \n
To all our Soldiers past and present, God Bless \n
Glory to the American Flag, long may she wave \n
So many have been covered with her when they've \n
gone to their grave \n
So many of us have taken for granted that our \n
freedom will always be \n
We tend to forget those who have kept that \n
right for you and for me \n
A Soldier will stand and fight all night to \n
keep us from harm \n
While some of us sit at home and refuse to \n
lift an arm \n
Some sit around and complain all day how \n
wrong this war must be \n
While a Soldier pushes that aside to continue \n
to fight for you and me \n
Some sit around and complain about the food \n
their going to eat \n
While a Soldier works straight through \n
hungry and weary on his feet \n
While you sit around and complain about what \n
you have or where you live \n
Remember what a Soldier somewhere for you is \n
about to give \n
A Soldier stands tall and proud and ready for \n
the fight \n
We must stand strong behind them through \n
their hard and arduous plight \n
Lee Greenwood said it best 'The Flag still \n
stands for Freedom and they can't take that away' \n
So give Thanks to our Soldiers out there each \n
and every day \n<|endoftext|>

Travel light a friend once said to me, \n
'Yeah right' i thought with my big screen TV, \n
but over the years I've changed my view, \n
now i know there are very few things truly essential to you. \n
Each move I disposed of more sentimental tat, \n
it became easier as i realised, don't need this, don't need that. \n
Then one summer's day i was forced from my home, \n
loads more had to go, into storage went some, \n
Now i live in a hostel with limited bits, \n
eight months on, the stored, do i need it? \n
With every possession also comes responsibility, \n
burglars shot to save a five pound DVD, \n
so now I'm working my way to cut off the slack, \n
i want to end up with just a rucksack, \n
then I'll have freedom, true freedom to roam, \n
wherever i lay, that'll be my home. \n<|endoftext|>

freedom \n
God's love is unconditional \n
It is not bound by strings, \n
He does not give the bird a voice \n
Then tell it what to sing; \n
He does not give us wings to fly \n
Then tell us where to go, \n
He does not give each man a mind \n
Then tell him what to know; \n
Life is an experience - \n
Each man will choose his way, \n
And if he makes wrong choices \n
They'll come back to him one day, \n
But still he learns the lesson, \n
Be it difficult or not - \n
God does not tell us what to learn \n
Nor dictate how it's taught. \n<|endoftext|>

home \n
When I was dead, my spirit turned \n
To seek the much-frequented house: \n
I passed the door, and saw my friends \n
Feasting beneath green orange boughs; \n
From hand to hand they pushed the wine, \n
They sucked the pulp of plum and peach; \n
They sang, they jested, and they laughed, \n
For each was loved of each. \n
I listened to thier honest chat: \n
Said one: "To-morrow we shall be \n
Plod plod along the featureless sands, \n
And coasting miles and miles of sea." \n
Said one: "Before the turn of tide \n
We will achieve the eyrie-seat." \n
Said one: "To-morrow shall be like \n
To-day, but much more sweet." \n
"To-morrow," said they, strong with hope, \n
And dwelt upon the pleasant way: \n
"To-morrow," cried they, one and all, \n
While no one spoke of yesterday. \n
Their life stood full at blessed noon; \n
I, only I, had passed away: \n
"To-morrow and to-day," they cried; \n
I was of yesterday. \n
I shivered comfortless, but cast \n
No chill across the table-cloth; \n
I, all-forgotten, shivered, sad \n
To stay, and yet to part how loth: \n
I passed from the familiar room, \n
I who from love had passed away, \n
Like the remembrance of a guest \n
That tarrieth but a day. \n<|endoftext|>

Mark the note that rises, mark the notes that fall, \n

- New Orleans, November 1910 \n
Four weeks have passed since I left, and still \n
I must write to you of no work. I've worn down \n
the soles and walked through the tightness \n
of my new shoes calling upon the merchants, \n
their offices bustling. All the while I kept thinking \n
my plain English and good writing would secure \n
for me some modest position Though I dress each day \n
in my best, hands covered with the lace gloves \n
you crocheted- no one needs a girl. How flat \n
the word sounds, and heavy. My purse thins. \n
I spend foolishly to make an appearance of quiet \n
industry, to mask the desperation that tightens \n
my throat. I sit watching- \n
though I pretend not to notice- the dark maids \n
ambling by with their white charges. Do I deceive \n
anyone? Were they to see my hands, brown \n
as your dear face, they'd know I'm not quite \n
what I pretend to be. I walk these streets \n
a white woman, or so I think, until I catch the eyes \n
of some stranger upon me, and I must lower mine, \n
a negress again. There are enough things here \n
to remind me who I am. Mules lumbering through \n
the crowded streets send me into reverie, their footfall \n
the sound of a pointer and chalk hitting the blackboard \n
at school, only louder. Then there are women, clicking \n
their tongues in conversation, carrying their loads \n
on their heads. Their husky voices, the wash pots \n
and irons of the laundresses call to me. \n
I thought not to do the work I once did, back bending \n
and domestic; my schooling a gift- even those half days \n
at picking time, listening to Miss J- . How \n
I'd come to know words, the recitations I practiced \n
to sound like her, lilting, my sentences curling up \n
or trailing off at the ends. I read my books until \n
I nearly broke their spines, and in the cotton field, \n
I repeated whole sections I'd learned by heart, \n
spelling each word in my head to make a picture \n
I could see, as well as a weight I could feel \n
in my mouth. So now, even as I write this \n
and think of you at home, Goodbye \n
is the waving map of your palm, is \n
a stone on my tongue. \n<|endoftext|>
home \n
Varus drags me into his affairs \n
out of the Forum, where I’m seen idling: \n
to a little whore I immediately saw, \n
not very inelegant, not unattractive, \n
who, when we came there, met us \n
with varied chatter, including, how might \n
Bithynia stand now, what’s it like, and where \n
might the benefit have been to me in cash. \n
I told her what’s true, nothing at all, \n
while neither the praetors nor their aides, \n
return any the richer, especially since \n
our Praetor, Memmius, the bugger, \n
cared not a jot for his followers. \n
‘But surely,’ they said, you could have bought \n
slaves they say are made for the litter there.’ \n
I, so the girl might take me to be wealthy, \n
said ‘no, for me things weren’t so bad, \n
that coming across one bad province, \n
I couldn’t buy eight good men.’ \n
But I’d no one, neither here nor there, \n
who might even raise to his shoulder \n
the shattered foot of an old couch. \n
At this she, like the shameless thing she was, said \n
‘I beg you, my dear Catullus, for the loan of them, \n
just for a while: I’d like to be carried \n
to Serap’s temple.’ ‘Wait’ I said to the girl, \n
‘what I just said was mine, isn’t actually in \n
my possession: my friend Cinna, that’s Gaius, \n
purchased the thing for himself. \n
Whether they’re his or mine, what difference to me? \n
I use them just as well as if I’d bought them myself. \n
But you are quite tasteless, and annoying, \n
you with whom no inexactness is allowed.’ \n<|endoftext|>

stopped at one old dear who looked \n

change to routine, and said \n

Nuts for the pigeons and some for the squiriels, \n

Happy laughter of children floated by as on wings, \n

Sharers of a common country, \n
They had met in deadly strife; \n
Men who should have been as brothers \n
Madly sought each other's life. \n
In the silence of the even, \n
When the cannon's lips were dumb, \n
Thoughts of home and all its loved ones \n
To the soldier's heart would come. \n
On the margin of a river, \n
'Mid the evening's dews and damps, \n
Could be heard the sounds of music \n
Rising from two hostile camps. \n
One was singing of its section \n
Down in Dixie, Dixie's land, \n
And the other of the banner \n
Waved so long from strand to strand. \n
In the land where Dixie's ensign \n
Floated o'er the hopeful slave, \n
Rose the song that freedom's banner, \n
Starry-lighted, long might wave. \n
From the fields of strife and carnage, \n
Gentle thoughts began to roam, \n
And a tender strain of music \n
Rose with words of "Home, Sweet Home." \n
Then the hearts of strong men melted, \n
For amid our grief and sin \n
Still remains that "touch of nature," \n
Telling us we all are kin. \n
In one grand but gentle chorus, \n
Floating to the starry dome, \n
Came the words that brought them nearer, \n
Words that told of "Home, Sweet Home." \n
For awhile, all strife forgotten, \n
They were only brothers then, \n
Joining in the sweet old chorus, \n
Not as soldiers, but as men. \n
Men whose hearts would flow together, \n
Though apart their feet might roam, \n
Found a tie they could not sever, \n
In the mem'ry of each home. \n
Never may the steps of carnage \n
Shake our land from shore to shore, \n
But may mother, home and Heaven, \n
Be our watchwords evermore. \n<|endoftext|>

Hidden like a forest flower? \n

Stalks the wild-eyed savage, danger! \n

Flowing from snow-shining mountains? \n
There the avalanches thunder, \n
Crushing all that lieth under! \n
In some hermit-tent, pitched lowly \n
Mid the tombs of prophets holy? \n
There to harry and annoy her \n
Roams the infidel destroyer. \n
In palatial chambers gilded, \n
Guarded round with towers high-builded? \n
Change may enter these to-morrow, \n
And with change may enter sorrow. \n

It is the most distant course that comes nearest to thyself, \n

The traveler has to knock at every alien door to come to his own, \n

Called him worthy to be loved, \n
Truest friend and noblest foe; \n

Who danger and the dead had faced, \n
But never quaked before. \n

My hand, with trembling care, \n
Lest back the awful door should spring, \n

Let them know I won't die \n

I'm so sick of this place \n
I've seen this all before \n
It's uglier then my face \n
Dream with pain from you \n
Awake with pain from you \n
I'm afraid to be alone \n
I'm afraid to stay at home. \n<|endoftext|>

Home they brought her warrior dead: \n
She nor swoon'd nor utter'd cry: \n
All her maidens, watching, said, \n
"She must weep or she will die." \n
Then they praised him, soft and low, \n
Call'd him worthy to be loved, \n
Truest friend and noblest foe; \n
Yet she neither spoke nor moved. \n
Stole a maiden from her place, \n
Lightly to the warrior stepped, \n
Took the face-cloth from the face; \n
Yet she neither moved nor wept. \n
Rose a nurse of ninety years, \n
Set his child upon her knee-- \n
Like summer tempest came her tears-- \n
"Sweet my child, I live for thee." \n<|endoftext|>

'Tis The \n
SONG OF LITTLE MARY, \n
Standing at the bar-room door \n
While the shameful midnight revel \n
Rages wildly as before. \n
Father, dear father, come home with me now! \n
The clock in the steeple strikes one; \n
You said you were coming right home from the shop, \n
As soon as your day's work was done. \n
Our fire has gone out our house is all dark \n
And mother's been watching since tea, -- \n
With poor brother Benny so sick in her arms, \n
And no one to help her but me. -- \n
Come home! come home! come home! -- \n
Please, father, dear father, come home. -- \n
Hear the sweet voice of the child \n
Which the night winds repeat as they roam! \n
Oh who could resist this most plaintive of prayers? \n
"Please, father, dear father, come home." \n
Father, dear father, come home with me now! \n
The clock in the steeple strikes two; \n
The night has grown colder, and Benny is worse \n
But he has been calling for you. \n
Indeed he is worse Ma says he will die, \n
Perhaps before morning shall dawn; -- \n
And this is the message she sent me to bring \n
"Come quickly, or he will be gone." -- \n
Come home! come home! come home! -- \n
Please, father, dear father, come home. -- \n
Hear the sweet voice of the child \n
Which the night winds repeat as they roam! \n
Oh who could resist this most plaintive of prayers? \n
"Please, father, dear father, come home." \n
Father, dear father, come home with me now! \n
The clock in the steeple strikes three; \n
The house is so lonely the hours are so long \n
For poor weeping mother and me. \n
Yes, we are alone poor Benny is dead, \n
And gone with the angels of light; -- \n
And these were the very last words that he said \n
"I want to kiss Papa good night." -- \n
Come home! come home! come home! -- \n
Please, father, dear father, come home. -- \n
Hear the sweet voice of the child \n
Which the night winds repeat as they roam! \n
Oh who could resist this most plaintive of prayers? \n
"Please, father, dear father, come home." \n<|endoftext|>
home \n
(To Robert Graves) \n
I \n
Here I'm sitting in the gloom \n
Of my quiet attic room. \n
France goes rolling all around, \n
Fledged with forest May has crowned. \n
And I puff my pipe, calm-hearted, \n
Thinking how the fighting started, \n
Wondering when we'll ever end it, \n
Back to hell with Kaiser sent it, \n
Gag the noise, pack up and go, \n
Clockwork soldiers in a row. \n
I've got better things to do \n
Than to waste my time on you. \n
II \n
Robert, when I drowse to-night, \n
Skirting lawns of sleep to chase \n
Shifting dreams in mazy light, \n
Somewhere then I'll see your face \n
Turning back to bid me follow \n
Where I wag my arms and hollo, \n
Over hedges hasting after \n
Crooked smile and baffling laughter, \n
Running tireless, floating, leaping, \n
Down your web-hung woods and valleys, \n
Where the glowworm stars are peeping, \n
Till I find you, quiet as stone \n
On a hill-top all alone, \n
Staring outward, gravely pondering \n
Jumbled leagues of hillock-wandering. \n
III \n
You and I have walked together \n
In the starving winter weather. \n
We've been glad because we knew \n
Time's too short and friends are few. \n
We've been sad because we missed \n
One whose yellow head was kissed \n
By the gods, who thought about him \n
Till they couldn't do without him. \n
Now he's here again; I've been \n
Soldier David dressed in green, \n
Standing in a wood that swings \n
To the madrigal he sings. \n
He's come back, all mirth and glory, \n
Like the prince in a fairy tory. \n
Winter called him far away; \n
Blossoms bring him home with May. \n
IV \n
Well, I know you'll swear it's true \n
That you found him decked in blue \n
Striding up through morning-land \n
With a cloud on either hand. \n
Out in Wales, you'll say, he marches \n
Arm-in-arm with aoks and larches; \n
Hides all night in hilly nooks, \n
Laughs at dawn in tumbling brooks. \n
Yet, it's certain, here he teaches \n
Outpost-schemes to groups of beeches. \n
And I'm sure, as here I stand, \n
That he shines through every land, \n
That he sings in every place \n
Where we're thinking of his face. \n
V \n
Robert, there's a war in France; \n
Everywhere men bang and blunder, \n
Sweat and swear and worship Chance, \n
Creep and blink through cannon thunder. \n
Rifles crack and bullets flick, \n
Sing and hum like hornet-swarms. \n
Bones are smashed and buried quick. \n
Yet, through stunning battle storms, \n
All the while I watch the spark \n
Lit to guide me; for I know \n
Dreams will triumph, though the dark \n
Scowls above me where I go. \n
You can hear me; you can mingle \n
Radiant folly with my jingle. \n
War's a joke for me and you \n
While we know such dreams are true! \n<|endoftext|>
home \n
This is the place that I love the best, \n
A little brown house, like a ground-bird's nest, \n
Hid among grasses, and vines, and trees, \n
Summer retreat of the birds and bees. \n
The tenderest light that ever was seen \n
Sifts through the vine-made window screen-- \n
Sifts and quivers, and flits and falls \n
On home-made carpets and gray-hung walls. \n
All through June the west wind free \n
The breath of clover brings to me. \n
All through the languid July day \n
I catch the scent of new-mown hay. \n
The morning-glories and scarlet vine \n
Over the doorway twist and twine; \n
And every day, when the house is still, \n
The humming-bird comes to the window-sill. \n
In the cunningest chamber under the sun \n
I sink to sleep when the day is done; \n
And am waked at morn, in my snow-white bed, \n
By a singing bird on the roof o'erhead. \n
Better than treasures brought from Rome, \n
Are the living pictures I see at home-- \n
My aged father, with frosted hair, \n
And mother's face, like a painting rare. \n
Far from the city's dust and heat, \n
I get but sounds and odors sweet. \n
Who can wonder I love to stay, \n
Week after week, here hidden away, \n
In this sly nook that I love the best-- \n
This little brown house like a ground-bird's nest? \n<|endoftext|>
home \n
The day that Danny went away \n
He didn't make a fuss. \n
It was the second day of May.... \n
He left a note for us. \n
It said he'd join us later on.... \n
He wanted better life. \n
God knows we tried before he left, \n
Despite some family strife. \n
But off he went, with nothing but \n
The clothing that he wore. \n
A friend who saw him headed north, \n
Reported nothing more. \n
Where did he go? What could he do? \n
A fifteen-year-old boy.... \n
A letter or a phone call would \n
Just fill our hearts with joy. \n
But we must sit and wonder as \n
We hope and pray for him, \n
While he is out there all alone \n
In answer to his whim. \n
This quiet plea is in our hearts \n
With every passing night: \n
'Come home to us now, Danny boy, \n
Let's try to make things right.' \n
God help and guide you, Danny boy, \n
And bring you home to stay. \n
Then we'll forget that day in May.... \n
When you just walked away. \n

home \n
Come, Sons of Summer, by whose toil \n
We are the lords of wine and oil: \n
By whose tough labours, and rough hands, \n
We rip up first, then reap our lands. \n
Crown'd with the ears of corn, now come, \n
And, to the pipe, sing Harvest Home. \n
Come forth, my lord, and see the cart \n
Drest up with all the country art. \n
See, here a maukin, there a sheet, \n
As spotless pure, as it is sweet: \n
The horses, mares, and frisking fillies, \n
Clad, all, in linen white as lilies. \n
The harvest swains and wenches bound \n
For joy, to see the Hock-Cart crown'd. \n
About the cart, hear, how the rout \n
Of rural younglings raise the shout; \n
Pressing before, some coming after, \n
Those with a shout, and these with laughter. \n
Some bless the cart; some kiss the sheaves; \n
Some prank them up with oaken leaves: \n
Some cross the fill-horse; some with great \n
Devotion, stroke the home-borne wheat: \n
While other rustics, less attent \n
To prayers, than to merriment, \n
Run after with their breeches rent. \n
--Well, on, brave boys, to your lord's hearth, \n
Glitt'ring with fire; where, for your mirth, \n
Ye shall see first the large and chief \n
Foundation of your feast, fat beef; \n
With upper stories, mutton, veal \n
And bacon, which makes full the meal, \n
With sev'ral dishes standing by, \n
As here a custard, there a pie, \n
And here, all tempting frumenty. \n
And for to make the merry cheer, \n
If smirking wine be wanting here, \n
There's that which drowns all care, stout beer: \n
Which freely drink to your lord's health \n
Then to the plough, the common-wealth; \n
Next to your flails, your fanes, your vats; \n
Then to the maids with wheaten hats: \n
To the rough sickle, and crookt scythe,-- \n
Drink, frolic, boys, till all be blythe. \n
Feed, and grow fat; and as ye eat, \n
Be mindful, that the lab'ring neat, \n
As you, may have their fill of meat. \n
And know, besides, ye must revoke \n
The patient ox unto the yoke, \n
And all go back unto the plough \n
And harrow, though they're hang'd up now. \n
And, you must know, your lord's word's true, \n
Feed him ye must, whose food fills you; \n
And that this pleasure is like rain, \n
Not sent ye for to drown your pain, \n
But for to make it spring again. \n<|endoftext|>

The kust we fought for wasn't worth it's own right. \n
The lust we fought for seemed so out of control. \n
The lust we fought for only needed us to grab ahold. \n
So the lust we fought for wasn't lust at all. \n
Indeed it was love that made our great fall. \n
The lust we fought for keeps me crying at night. \n
The lust we fought for has me praying to turn it right. \n
The lust we fought for makes me miss you more. \n
The lust we fought for broke my heart to it's core. \n
The lust we fought for brings out a million tears. \n
The lust we fought for challenged all of my fears. \n
So the lust we fought for was the pain i deserved to face. \n
Indeed it was love from that magically beautiful place. \n
The lust we fought for is now gone up in flames... \n
Because I now know that the lust we fought for was real all the same. \n<|endoftext|>

Waves of a storm, downward crashing! \n
Slow deep and in - the thrusting goes \n
Till faster faster the whole thing blows! \n
A runaway train smashing into a station \n
Eruptions fly in exultation! \n
Full body slamming from the top \n
Yields a fair good splashing crop \n
Full body slamming from behind \n

Thus, the moonstone rises high \n

Embrace your loyal knight \n
Gently, graze the skin with lust \n
You smile sweetly; vouch your trust \n

A sigh of ecstasy \n
Tongues engage, a lustful duel \n
Yet, you win! Oh, how cruel... \n
Arch for me, my precious jewel \n
Be this destiny! \n
Eyes hold fires, raging flames \n
Lover's passion can't be tamed \n
Sinful fires! I'm not ashamed \n
Fury in our love! \n
Harsher breathing as I drive \n
Gods! I've never felt so alive \n
Our souls, now, cannot be rived \n
The stars envy above \n
Harder, deeper, slower grinds \n
A feeling that just blows my mind \n
I hiss your name and say your mine \n
The fire consumes us \n
As we thrust and grind and kiss \n
I call your name, everlasting mistress \n
You call my name in utter bliss \n
The climax of our lust! \n
A flood of light! We both explode! \n
We grasp each other and tightly hold! \n
A cry of impulse thus untold! \n
We collapse upon each other \n
Now you gently kiss my lips, \n
and gently, lovingly sway your hips. \n
I'll taste your nectar in gentle sips \n
We truly love one another \n

Which never seem to break through but all that days has gone \n
Do you ever heard me cry out for you? in my breathless murn \n
In my weak heart just broke that I can't take in but to bury all that moments deep inside of me \n
Why does love is such a crime? \n
When our love was just so real? \n
Why would someone want a part like this? \n
When we knew we were meant to be \n
How my heart peel into pieces like a broken glass that can't be un-do \n
How our feelings and the affeaction is like a drung like what you said to me onces but that last. \n
How you wishper Don't worry I knew I'm gone to lost you forever \n

Goodbye to you my love, LOve Is just like a lust \n
Giving up on you love Isn't easy \n

At one time you were settled \n

It's not the things you say to me \n
it's simply the way you look at me \n
Hard for me to look at you, into \n
the eyes of the one I could be \n
drawn to \n
We had the chance and \n
you stopped, you realized \n
what was true \n
That it was only an illusion, \n
a desire that we both share \n
something we both know \n
we can't allow to be true \n
Time has passed now and \n
it's starting again \n
But we can't let this happen \n
I've come to far now to sin \n
But your bold more confident now \n
you hang around like before \n
hoping to talk, to get me alone \n
the same way it started before \n
I can't let this happen but I don't \n
know if I could, addiction is only \n

lust \n
I don't believe in love, I decided long ago: \n
that other hearts were summer heat and mine was winter snow \n
I despised them for their impudence, oh such a long way to go! \n
I bet myself another life that I would never feel too \n
What silly girls and silly boys called 'love', their new- \n
found companionship displayed in sycophantic spew \n
of words and promises that would change next week. \n
I thought myself so strong, compared to them so bloody meek \n
And in every spare debate said as loud as I could speak \n
'There is no such thing as love' \n
don't you get it? \n
Then one day I found myself dreaming, exam half finished beneath me \n
I couldn't stop imagining your hands on my skin, see? \n
But it faded when those words escaped your lips, so true it must be \n
that I am the only one in this stunted world that feels like that. \n
When dreams flash past I take part, \n
(Shadows of limbs intertwined I alone would call art) . \n
It occured to me as daylight, slick and ever bright \n
Swept away the languid presence, the sloe black, crow black night \n
Something that had nothing to do with my beating heart. I might \n
be wrong. \n
Truth is, I am in lust. Not love, not that patronising knife blade, that ignorant, fetid, unreal stigma, but lust. A real emotion, real, raw and completely deserving of a saint, \n
a day, \n
cards that say what we are too polite to, \n
of songs and books, and precious poems. \n
Lust is all around, and I'll admit to this: \n
I'm falling in lust with you, \n
(just don't quote me on that.) \n<|endoftext|>

displaying a history of \n
driving Love's Bent; \n
but, more importantly, also a history of voracious greed, death, blood and atrocities, \n
its spread now reaches the dead vampire desire for immortality \n
by sucking red blood from prone victims \n
who crave \n
love, sex and death in swain's sucklings \n
fired of the desire to cheat death and live forever, \n
even at the cost of dead hand affections \n
and dark broodings \n
outside the light- \n
an ultimate narcissistic \n
confection \n
consumed \n
of poisoned drops; \n
of failed promises \n
illusioned drinkings \n
and bloody hands. \n
All there in history: \n
power mongers \n
mind killers \n
word demons \n
culture jailers \n
dead limp drug healers \n
all seeking to bury Faith alive \n
strangle Hope in its baby crib \n
all watered \n
under Lust's tree \n
and producing \n
millions of dead gray leaves \n
all embraced \n
reeking of the still warm blood \n
sucked from others. \n
All these in human history \n
seen marching \n
lashing the backs of slaves \n
of women, hapless men \n
of children; \n
an obsessed march \n
toward Lust's Dark Horizons \n
contorting history \n
while True Virtue \n
miraculously at History's Turning Point \n
ultimately showed its face \n
and started it's own march toward justice, mercy \n
and democracy \n
progress slow to be sure \n
but relentless \n
with these transfusions \n
now turning gray to green in some places, \n
and that battle \n
while not yet won \n
has been joined. \n
The lesson here my friend \n
then \n
is that there is a difference \n
between Good \n
and Evil. \n<|endoftext|>

You glance over and smile, \n
A smile just for me, \n

There's a hidden passion, \n
I can't let out. \n
I have to hold back, \n
My body screams for you, \n
I can't get you off my mind. \n
I wanna be more than friends, \n
I wanna be everything for you, \n
But I don't know how you feel. \n
So I've got to keep it, \n
To myself, \n
My secret lust. \n<|endoftext|>

lust \n
When on Vedas I concentrate, \n
Human passions come in spate; \n
From the Vedas take me away, \n
On my mind they hold sway. \n
Lust comes to me as a wild fire, \n
I am astounded with base desire(s): \n
Like a savage it lives at the root, \n
Am I a man or am I a brute? \n
But sapling of life from it sprout(s) , \n
On its maturity love is the fruit; \n
Lust as seedling dissolves in dust, \n
Soon my love flowers in trust. \n
Its sweet fragrance removes disgust, \n
My whole world brightens up robust; \n
It is the basis of home and hearth, \n
In it lies all my mirth and worth. \n
Then it builds new castles of trust, \n
Thus I pass on from trust to trust; \n
Call it vicious or girdle girth, \n
Thus I wander birth to birth. \n<|endoftext|>
lust \n
Are you blind or eyes were gone \n
In lust or many more \n
To grab the dust of grass \n
Filling your never ending desire \n
Craving for nothing that you deserve \n
And why I am suppose to die \n
Upon you unholy feet \n
Love is dead \n
On the day this face was smudged with your lies \n
Calling no name and I know one \n
Dear heart was broken and I must get you forsaken \n
Until the end of time! \n<|endoftext|>
lust \n
Some say they believe in \n
love at first sight… \n
I scoff at those who see the \n
truth in this. \n
Love is an acquired thing, \n
you can't love someone you just \n
laid your eyes upon. \n
Lust, on the other hand is an \n
instantaneous thing, \n
an almost life threatening thing. \n
Lust causes babies and disease, \n
It is hard to tell the difference \n
Between the two…Love? Or lust? \n
That is something you will know when it happens, \n
Love doesn’t come easily, Lust does. \n<|endoftext|>

hunting \n
In my youth I was a hunter. \n
As age advances, I hunt for memory. \n
I remember planting flowers by the front steps, \n
just old enough to dig with a spoon. \n
I planted nasturtiums and was amazed at the riot of color as that grew. \n
I knew then I wanted to grow things. \n
I remember the garden gate I built at seven and how \n
my mother bragged on its durability all her life. \n
I knew then I wanted to build things. \n
I remember painting the kitchen and the smell of the glossy oil paint. \n
I remember the dogwood in bloom in an upper valley. \n
I remember roaming, searching; I remember beech trees, and the stillness of the woods before my eye caught the movement of a squirrel. \n
I remember the jeweled rocks in our rippling creek. \n
I remember home, the garden patch, apple picking, \n
the cool fall air, the first frost, cedar Christmas trees \n
and priceless winters when southern snow blew in from the west. \n
I remember the first daffodils of spring. \n
All childhood is intact, all of my life stored in memory. \n
I remember love and love lost, \n
and found and lost again. \n
I remember joy and pain, grief and new hope. \n
For now the monster of forgetting is at bay. \n
I can remember. \n
I can hunt, I can find, all time not yet lost. \n<|endoftext|>
hunting \n
Kudos to a failed hunting \n
The net was laid perfect \n
No chances for a rabbit to escape \n
The expertise of an experienced \n
Hunter and his flesh lust \n
I waited \n
And she ran into the trap \n
My favorite snow white rabbit \n
“Oh not again” I heard her uttering in dismay \n
And she wore the gestures of horror and disbelief \n
Smoke stained lips and teeth \n
Forming into an loathsome grin \n
I snorted “I want your flesh” \n
Caressing the barrel of my favorite gun \n
“Go eat your deer” spreading her eyes for \n
An escape she yelled back \n
“I am tired of vegetables” \n
Penetrating the gum gaps with toothpick \n
I replied her quite bored \n
“You had your share of my flesh…many times…” \n
I saw her eyes flowing helplessness \n
“I don’t care…I want I want to taste your tender flesh \n
And the warmth of your blood” \n
I aimed my gun at her \n
A moment’s silence \n
She leaped and disappeared \n
Into the large snake hole, I missed \n
Cussing violent and mad \n
Caused by an unexpected failure \n
I wrapped the net neat into its case \n
And returned home \n
I ate my deer \n
I was hungry \n
I slept snoring \n
I was tired from hunting and eating \n
Vegetable. \n<|endoftext|>
hunting \n
Hunting The Light \n
Travelling down the sewers \n
of this ungrateful soul of mine \n
as the sickness becomes a squatter \n
taken over my body and mind. \n
The torment that's unleashed \n
upon the unsuspecting visitors \n
who just happen by chance \n
to cross paths. \n
Thrown into the abyss \n
without a care or second glance \n
discarded, rendered useless \n
left to die, a lonely death. \n
As vibrant colours dissipates \n
as their sparkles are dying out \n
life has lost its meaning \n
only inner struggles remain. \n
But, \n
I'm sure I heard it mentioned once \n
of a light that still remains \n
a tunnel with an exit light \n
I'll search for, not in vain \n
to find this elusive tunnel. \n
Where life begins again. \n
Hunting for the light of life. \n

hunting \n
No more the summer floweret charms, \n
The leaves will soon be sere, \n
And Autumn folds his jewelled arms \n
Around the dying year; \n
So, ere the waning seasons claim \n
Our leafless groves awhile, \n
With golden wine and glowing flame \n
We â€™ll crown our lonely isle. \n
Once more the merry voices sound \n
Within the antlered hall, \n
And long and loud the baying hounds \n
Return the hunterâ€™s call; \n
And through the woods, and oâ€™er the hill, \n
And far along the bay, \n
The driverâ€™s horn is sounding shrill,â€”Â­ \n
Up, sportsmen, and away! \n
No bars of steel or walls of stone \n
Our little empire bound, \n
But, circling with his azure zone, \n
The sea runs foaming round; \n
The whitening wave, the purpled skies, \n
The blue and lifted shore, \n
Braid with their dim and blending dyes \n
Our wide horizon oâ€™er. \n
And who will leave the grave debate \n
That shakes the smoky town, \n
To rule amid our island-state, \n
And wear our oak-leaf crown? \n
And who will be awhile content \n
To hunt our woodland game, \n
And leave the vulgar pack that scent \n
The reeking track of fame? \n
Ah, who that shares in toils like these \n
Will sigh not to prolong \n
Our days beneath the broad-leaved trees, \n
Our nights of mirth and song? \n
Then leave the dust of noisy streets, \n
Ye outlaws of the wood, \n
And follow through his green retreats \n
Your noble Robin Hood. \n<|endoftext|>
hunting \n
There is the remorseless, tireless seeking \n
and following of the soul by the Divine Life. \n
The inexorable onward sweep of this \n
‘Tremendous lover' is hunting the separated spirit \n
that flees him down the nights and down the days. \n
Our natural will is to have God. \n
The good will of God is to have us. \n
We may never cease from longing \n
till we have him in fullness of joy. \n
The mystic vision is of a spiritual universe, \n
held tight within the bonds of love. \n

hunting \n
It seems like we thrive from the adrenaline flow \n
While hunting the morning of the very first snow. \n
For all the mornings that we practically froze \n
When we can't feel our fingers, or the tips of our toes. \n
Yet, we still hunt day after day \n
In anticipation of the moment we can finally say \n
'I GOT A DEER' with a cheerful shout. \n
As we jump up and down and run all about. \n
We think it's skill, but it's mostly luck \n
That feeling we get when we get our first buck. \n
When we talk about the hunt, or the antler size \n
No one knows the real truth, 'cause everyone lies. \n
It's remembering our first hunt, as a girl or a boy \n
When we felt the excitement with a heart full of joy. \n
It's the fun that we have with our family and friends. \n
It's the sharing and experience that we hope never ends. \n
So, go deer hunting...just do it some day \n
Then you might understand what I'm trying to say. \n
Hunting deer is special to me \n
So, try it sometime and you'll find out and see. \n<|endoftext|>
hunting \n
That was the age of nineteen, \n
The age for searching for the queen. \n
Many were spotted on line, \n
None of whom was to my design. \n
I sighted her on the bank \n
Of a tank on a dusky night, \n
With her two sisters to flank. \n
It was a temple festive feat. \n
She was fatter than the sisters. \n
She was darker than the sisters. \n
She only pulled me to her side \n
By her freshness and youngness. \n
Can I pull her? – A challenge, \n
Her formidability threw to me \n
To test how best I can stand \n
To win over a woman’s hand. \n
If beaten and beaten, even \n
A rock can be well shaken. \n
By repeatedly seen, the rock \n
Was moved. I was in peak. \n
I found her home and family, \n
Which was on my way luckily. \n
Her clan was just one step away. \n
That was the block in my way. \n
I won her vision every morning \n
And evening, from her balcony. \n
I won her consent in picking \n
My letters, thrown from bicycle. \n
I won her presence in a tryst \n
That she planned in a lone house. \n
With her maid, she gave audience \n
And urged me for an alliance. \n
She was there so near me as fire. \n
I stood there bare as tinder. \n
No touch, no kiss, I was perfect. \n
I wanted to earn her respect. \n
Badly I buried my lust \n
To stand high in her estimate. \n
Sadly I hurried to exit \n
As a noble, missing a feast. \n
Her stepbrother was my teacher, \n
A smooth friendly character. \n
He took my proposal as dry \n
And sent me out high and dry. \n
I can have her by inter caste; \n
Her child will then suffer great \n
To choose her a suitable mate. \n
Therefore, he was against my act. \n
She gave pose from balcony. \n
I got it from down below, cycling. \n
Twice a day, there were many. \n
To our love there was no blow. \n
Later her brother came down \n
From his stand and made it known \n
That I could get her hand \n
If my parents gave their hand. \n
That stand he should have taken \n
By the pressure she had given. \n
A clear indication of her, \n
That she was keen for our tie. \n
I averred to my revered mother \n
In alluded way. No use. \n
With no job, no money, to muster \n
Strength is in vain. I stood aloof. \n
Days rolled. There was no courage. \n
Study was over. Time parted us. \n
I cursed my cowardliness. \n
All ended in tragic senses. \n
I lost my love without guts. \n
I lost a bird without a hunt. \n
A tragic note then I wrote- \n
All are well that began well. \n
No more love had blossomed. \n
By now, forty years rolled. \n
Where is she? Whether she lives? . \n
To see her once is my bliss. \n

hunting \n
Full of wrath was Hiawatha \n
When he came into the village, \n
Found the people in confusion, \n
Heard of all the misdemeanors, \n
All the malice and the mischief, \n
Of the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis. \n
Hard his breath came through his nostrils, \n
Through his teeth he buzzed and muttered \n
Words of anger and resentment, \n
Hot and humming, like a hornet. \n
"I will slay this Pau-Puk-Keewis, \n
Slay this mischief-maker!" said he. \n
"Not so long and wide the world is, \n
Not so rude and rough the way is, \n
That my wrath shall not attain him, \n
That my vengeance shall not reach him!" \n
Then in swift pursuit departed \n
Hiawatha and the hunters \n
On the trail of Pau-Puk-Keewis, \n
Through the forest, where he passed it, \n
To the headlands where he rested; \n
But they found not Pau-Puk-Keewis, \n
Only in the trampled grasses, \n
In the whortleberry-bushes, \n
Found the couch where he had rested, \n
Found the impress of his body. \n
From the lowlands far beneath them, \n
From the Muskoday, the meadow, \n
Pau-Puk-Keewis, turning backward, \n
Made a gesture of defiance, \n
Made a gesture of derision; \n
And aloud cried Hiawatha, \n
From the summit of the mountains: \n
"Not so long and wide the world is, \n
Not so rude and rough the way is, \n
But my wrath shall overtake you, \n
And my vengeance shall attain you!" \n
Over rock and over river, \n
Through bush, and brake, and forest, \n
Ran the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis; \n
Like an antelope he bounded, \n
Till he came unto a streamlet \n
In the middle of the forest, \n
To a streamlet still and tranquil, \n
That had overflowed its margin, \n
To a dam made by the beavers, \n
To a pond of quiet water, \n
Where knee-deep the trees were standing, \n
Where the water lilies floated, \n
Where the rushes waved and whispered. \n
On the dam stood Pau-Puk-Keewis, \n
On the dam of trunks and branches, \n
Through whose chinks the water spouted, \n
O'er whose summit flowed the streamlet. \n
From the bottom rose the beaver, \n
Looked with two great eyes of wonder, \n
Eyes that seemed to ask a question, \n
At the stranger, Pau-Puk-Keewis. \n
On the dam stood Pau-Puk-Keewis, \n
O'er his ankles flowed the streamlet, \n
Flowed the bright and silvery water, \n
And he spake unto the beaver, \n
With a smile he spake in this wise: \n
"O my friend Ahmeek, the beaver, \n
Cool and pleasant Is the water; \n
Let me dive into the water, \n
Let me rest there in your lodges; \n
Change me, too, into a beaver!" \n
Cautiously replied the beaver, \n
With reserve he thus made answer: \n
"Let me first consult the others, \n
Let me ask the other beavers." \n
Down he sank into the water, \n
Heavily sank he, as a stone sinks, \n
Down among the leaves and branches, \n
Brown and matted at the bottom. \n
On the dam stood Pau-Puk-Keewis, \n
O'er his ankles flowed the streamlet, \n
Spouted through the chinks below him, \n
Dashed upon the stones beneath him, \n
Spread serene and calm before him, \n
And the sunshine and the shadows \n
Fell in flecks and gleams upon him, \n
Fell in little shining patches, \n
Through the waving, rustling branches. \n
From the bottom rose the beavers, \n
Silently above the surface \n
Rose one head and then another, \n
Till the pond seemed full of beavers, \n
Full of black and shining faces. \n
To the beavers Pau-Puk-Keewis \n
Spake entreating, said in this wise: \n
"Very pleasant Is your dwelling, \n
O my friends! and safe from danger; \n
Can you not, with all your cunning, \n
All your wisdom and contrivance, \n
Change me, too, into a beaver?" \n
"Yes!" replied Ahmeek, the beaver, \n
He the King of all the beavers, \n
"Let yourself slide down among us, \n
Down into the tranquil water." \n
Down into the pond among them \n
Silently sank Pau-Puk-Keewis; \n
Black became his shirt of deer-skin, \n
Black his moccasins and leggings, \n
In a broad black tail behind him \n
Spread his fox-tails and his fringes; \n
He was changed into a beaver. \n
"Make me large," said Pau-Puk-Keewis, \n
"Make me large and make me larger, \n
Larger than the other beavers." \n
"Yes," the beaver chief responded, \n
"When our lodge below you enter, \n
In our wigwam we will make you \n
Ten times larger than the others." \n
Thus into the clear, brown water \n
Silently sank Pau-Puk-Keewis: \n
Found the bottom covered over \n
With the trunks of trees and branches, \n
Hoards of food against the winter, \n
Piles and heaps against the famine; \n
Found the lodge with arching doorway, \n
Leading into spacious chambers. \n
Here they made him large and larger, \n
Made him largest of the beavers, \n
Ten times larger than the others. \n
"You shall be our ruler," said they; \n
"Chief and King of all the beavers." \n
But not long had Pau-Puk-Keewis \n
Sat in state among the beavers, \n
When there came a voice, of warning \n
From the watchman at his station \n
In the water-flags and lilies, \n
Saying, "Here Is Hiawatha! \n
Hiawatha with his hunters!" \n
Then they heard a cry above them, \n
Heard a shouting and a tramping, \n
Heard a crashing and a rushing, \n
And the water round and o'er them \n
Sank and sucked away in eddies, \n
And they knew their dam was broken. \n
On the lodge's roof the hunters \n
Leaped, and broke it all asunder; \n
Streamed the sunshine through the crevice, \n
Sprang the beavers through the doorway, \n
Hid themselves in deeper water, \n
In the channel of the streamlet; \n
But the mighty Pau-Puk-Keewis \n
Could not pass beneath the doorway; \n
He was puffed with pride and feeding, \n
He was swollen like a bladder. \n
Through the roof looked Hiawatha, \n
Cried aloud, "O Pau-Puk-Keewis \n
Vain are all your craft and cunning, \n
Vain your manifold disguises! \n
Well I know you, Pau-Puk-Keewis!" \n
With their clubs they beat and bruised him, \n
Beat to death poor Pau-Puk-Keewis, \n
Pounded him as maize is pounded, \n
Till his skull was crushed to pieces. \n
Six tall hunters, lithe and limber, \n
Bore him home on poles and branches, \n
Bore the body of the beaver; \n
But the ghost, the Jeebi in him, \n
Thought and felt as Pau-Puk-Keewis, \n
Still lived on as Pau-Puk-Keewis. \n
And it fluttered, strove, and struggled, \n
Waving hither, waving thither, \n
As the curtains of a wigwam \n
Struggle with their thongs of deer-skin, \n
When the wintry wind is blowing; \n
Till it drew itself together, \n
Till it rose up from the body, \n
Till it took the form and features \n
Of the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis \n
Vanishing into the forest. \n
But the wary Hiawatha \n
Saw the figure ere it vanished, \n
Saw the form of Pau-Puk-Keewis \n
Glide into the soft blue shadow \n
Of the pine-trees of the forest; \n
Toward the squares of white beyond it, \n
Toward an opening in the forest. \n
Like a wind it rushed and panted, \n
Bending all the boughs before it, \n
And behind it, as the rain comes, \n
Came the steps of Hiawatha. \n
To a lake with many islands \n
Came the breathless Pau-Puk-Keewis, \n
Where among the water-lilies \n
Pishnekuh, the brant, were sailing; \n
Through the tufts of rushes floating, \n
Steering through the reedy Islands. \n
Now their broad black beaks they lifted, \n
Now they plunged beneath the water, \n
Now they darkened in the shadow, \n
Now they brightened in the sunshine. \n
"Pishnekuh!" cried Pau-Puk-Keewis, \n
"Pishnekuh! my brothers!" said he, \n
"Change me to a brant with plumage, \n
With a shining neck and feathers, \n
Make me large, and make me larger, \n
Ten times larger than the others." \n
Straightway to a brant they changed him, \n
With two huge and dusky pinions, \n
With a bosom smooth and rounded, \n
With a bill like two great paddles, \n
Made him larger than the others, \n
Ten times larger than the largest, \n
Just as, shouting from the forest, \n
On the shore stood Hiawatha. \n
Up they rose with cry and clamor, \n
With a whir and beat of pinions, \n
Rose up from the reedy Islands, \n
From the water-flags and lilies. \n
And they said to Pau-Puk-Keewis: \n
"In your flying, look not downward, \n
Take good heed and look not downward, \n
Lest some strange mischance should happen, \n
Lest some great mishap befall you!" \n
Fast and far they fled to northward, \n
Fast and far through mist and sunshine, \n
Fed among the moors and fen-lands, \n
Slept among the reeds and rushes. \n
On the morrow as they journeyed, \n
Buoyed and lifted by the South-wind, \n
Wafted onward by the South-wind, \n
Blowing fresh and strong behind them, \n
Rose a sound of human voices, \n
Rose a clamor from beneath them, \n
From the lodges of a village, \n
From the people miles beneath them. \n
For the people of the village \n
Saw the flock of brant with wonder, \n
Saw the wings of Pau-Puk-Keewis \n
Flapping far up in the ether, \n
Broader than two doorway curtains. \n
Pau-Puk-Keewis heard the shouting, \n
Knew the voice of Hiawatha, \n
Knew the outcry of Iagoo, \n
And, forgetful of the warning, \n
Drew his neck in, and looked downward, \n
And the wind that blew behind him \n
Caught his mighty fan of feathers, \n
Sent him wheeling, whirling downward! \n
All in vain did Pau-Puk-Keewis \n
Struggle to regain his balance! \n
Whirling round and round and downward, \n
He beheld in turn the village \n
And in turn the flock above him, \n
Saw the village coming nearer, \n
And the flock receding farther, \n
Heard the voices growing louder, \n
Heard the shouting and the laughter; \n
Saw no more the flocks above him, \n
Only saw the earth beneath him; \n
Dead out of the empty heaven, \n
Dead among the shouting people, \n
With a heavy sound and sullen, \n
Fell the brant with broken pinions. \n
But his soul, his ghost, his shadow, \n
Still survived as Pau-Puk-Keewis, \n
Took again the form and features \n
Of the handsome Yenadizze, \n
And again went rushing onward, \n
Followed fast by Hiawatha, \n
Crying: "Not so wide the world is, \n
Not so long and rough the way Is, \n
But my wrath shall overtake you, \n
But my vengeance shall attain you!" \n
And so near he came, so near him, \n
That his hand was stretched to seize him, \n
His right hand to seize and hold him, \n
When the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis \n
Whirled and spun about in circles, \n
Fanned the air into a whirlwind, \n
Danced the dust and leaves about him, \n
And amid the whirling eddies \n
Sprang into a hollow oak-tree, \n
Changed himself into a serpent, \n
Gliding out through root and rubbish. \n
With his right hand Hiawatha \n
Smote amain the hollow oak-tree, \n
Rent it into shreds and splinters, \n
Left it lying there in fragments. \n
But in vain; for Pau-Puk-Keewis, \n
Once again in human figure, \n
Full in sight ran on before him, \n
Sped away in gust and whirlwind, \n
On the shores of Gitche Gumee, \n
Westward by the Big-Sea-Water, \n
Came unto the rocky headlands, \n
To the Pictured Rocks of sandstone, \n
Looking over lake and landscape. \n
And the Old Man of the Mountain, \n
He the Manito of Mountains, \n
Opened wide his rocky doorways, \n
Opened wide his deep abysses, \n
Giving Pau-Puk-Keewis shelter \n
In his caverns dark and dreary, \n
Bidding Pau-Puk-Keewis welcome \n
To his gloomy lodge of sandstone. \n
There without stood Hiawatha, \n
Found the doorways closed against him, \n
With his mittens, Minjekahwun, \n
Smote great caverns in the sandstone, \n
Cried aloud in tones of thunder, \n
"Open! I am Hiawatha!" \n
But the Old Man of the Mountain \n
Opened not, and made no answer \n
From the silent crags of sandstone, \n
From the gloomy rock abysses. \n
Then he raised his hands to heaven, \n
Called imploring on the tempest, \n
Called Waywassimo, the lightning, \n
And the thunder, Annemeekee; \n
And they came with night and darkness, \n
Sweeping down the Big-Sea-Water \n
From the distant Thunder Mountains; \n
And the trembling Pau-Puk-Keewis \n
Heard the footsteps of the thunder, \n
Saw the red eyes of the lightning, \n
Was afraid, and crouched and trembled. \n
Then Waywassimo, the lightning, \n
Smote the doorways of the caverns, \n
With his war-club smote the doorways, \n
Smote the jutting crags of sandstone, \n
And the thunder, Annemeekee, \n
Shouted down into the caverns, \n
Saying, "Where is Pau-Puk-Keewis!" \n
And the crags fell, and beneath them \n
Dead among the rocky ruins \n
Lay the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis, \n
Lay the handsome Yenadizze, \n
Slain in his own human figure. \n
Ended were his wild adventures, \n
Ended were his tricks and gambols, \n
Ended all his craft and cunning, \n
Ended all his mischief-making, \n
All his gambling and his dancing, \n
All his wooing of the maidens. \n
Then the noble Hiawatha \n
Took his soul, his ghost, his shadow, \n
Spake and said: "O Pau-Puk-Keewis, \n
Never more in human figure \n
Shall you search for new adventures' \n
Never more with jest and laughter \n
Dance the dust and leaves in whirlwinds; \n
But above there in the heavens \n
You shall soar and sail in circles; \n
I will change you to an eagle, \n
To Keneu, the great war-eagle, \n
Chief of all the fowls with feathers, \n
Chief of Hiawatha's chickens." \n
And the name of Pau-Puk-Keewis \n
Lingers still among the people, \n
Lingers still among the singers, \n
And among the story-tellers; \n
And in Winter, when the snow-flakes \n
Whirl in eddies round the lodges, \n
When the wind in gusty tumult \n
O'er the smoke-flue pipes and whistles, \n
"There," they cry, "comes Pau-Puk-Keewis, \n
He is dancing through the village, \n
He is gathering in his harvest!" \n<|endoftext|>

The Baker's Tale \n
They roused him with muffins--they roused him with ice-- \n
They roused him with mustard and cress-- \n
They roused him with jam and judicious advice-- \n
They set him conundrums to guess. \n
When at length he sat up and was able to speak, \n
His sad story he offered to tell; \n
And the Bellman cried "Silence! Not even a shriek!" \n
And excitedly tingled his bell. \n
There was silence supreme! Not a shriek, not a scream, \n
Scarcely even a howl or a groan, \n
As the man they called "Ho!" told his story of woe \n
In an antediluvian tone. \n
"My father and mother were honest, though poor--" \n
"Skip all that!" cried the Bellman in haste. \n
"If it once becomes dark, there's no chance of a Snark-- \n
We have hardly a minute to waste!" \n
"I skip forty years," said the Baker in tears, \n
"And proceed without further remark \n
To the day when you took me aboard of your ship \n
To help you in hunting the Snark. \n
"A dear uncle of mine (after whom I was named) \n
Remarked, when I bade him farewell--" \n
"Oh, skip your dear uncle!" the Bellman exclaimed, \n
As he angrily tingled his bell. \n
"He remarked to me then," said that mildest of men, \n
"'If your Snark be a Snark, that is right: \n
Fetch it home by all means--you may serve it with greens \n
And it's handy for striking a light. \n
"'You may seek it with thimbles--and seek it with care-- \n
You may hunt it with forks and hope; \n
You may threaten its life with a railway-share; \n
You may charm it with smiles and soap--'" \n
("That's exactly the method," the Bellman bold \n
In a hasty parenthesis cried, \n
"That's exactly the way I have always been told \n
That the capture of Snarks should be tried!") \n
"'But oh, beamish nephew, beware of the day, \n
If your Snark be a Boojum! For then \n
You will softly and suddenly vanish away, \n
And never be met with again!" \n
"It is this, it is this that oppresses my soul, \n
When I think of my uncle's last words: \n
And my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl \n
Brimming over with quivering curds! \n
"It is this, it is this--" "We have had that before!" \n
The Bellman indignantly said. \n
And the Baker replied "Let me say it once more. \n
It is this, it is this that I dread! \n
"I engage with the Snark--every night after dark-- \n
In a dreamy delirious fight: \n
I serve it with greens in those shadowy scenes, \n
And I use it for striking a light: \n
"But if ever I meet with a Boojum, that day, \n
In a moment (of this I am sure), \n
I shall softly and suddenly vanish away-- \n
And the notion I cannot endure!" \n<|endoftext|>

Fit the First \n
THE LANDING \n
'Just the place for a Snark!' the Bellman cried, \n
As he landed his crew with care; \n
Supporting each man on the top of the tide \n
By a finger entwined in his hair. \n
'Just the place for a Snark! I have said it twice: \n
That alone should encourage the crew. \n
Just the place for a Snark! I have said it thrice: \n
What i tell you three times is true.' \n
The crew was complete: it included a Boots-- \n
A maker of Bonnets and Hoods-- \n
A Barrister, brought to arrange their disputes-- \n
And a Broker, to value their goods. \n
A Billiard-maker, whose skill was immense, \n
Might perhaps have won more than his share-- \n
But a Banker, engaged at enormous expense, \n
Had the whole of their cash in his care. \n
There was also a Beaver, that paced on the deck, \n
Or would sit making lace in the bow: \n
And had often (the Bellman said) saved them from wreck, \n
Though none of the sailors knew how. \n
There was one who was famed for the number of things \n
He forgot when he entered the ship: \n
His umbrella, his watch, all his jewels and rings, \n
And the clothes he had bought for the trip. \n
He had forty-two boxes, all carefully packed, \n
With his name painted clearly on each: \n
But, since he omitted to mention the fact, \n
They were all left behind on the beach. \n
The loss of his clothes hardly mattered, because \n
He had seven coats on when he came, \n
With three pairs of boots--but the worst of it was, \n
He had wholly forgotten his name. \n
He would answer to 'Hi!' or to any loud cry, \n
Such as 'Fry me!' or 'Fritter my wig!' \n
To 'What-you-may-call-um!' or 'What-was-his-name!' \n
But especially 'Thing-um-a-jig!' \n
While, for those who preferred a more forcible word, \n
He had different names from these: \n
His intimate friends called him 'Candle-ends,' \n
And his enemies 'Toasted-cheese.' \n
'His form in ungainly--his intellect small--' \n
(So the Bellman would often remark) \n
'But his courage is perfect! And that, after all, \n
Is the thing that one needs with a Snark.' \n
He would joke with hyenas, returning their stare \n
With an impudent wag of the head: \n
And he once went a walk, paw-in-paw, with a bear, \n
'Just to keep up its spirits,' he said. \n
He came as a Baker: but owned, when too late-- \n
And it drove the poor Bellman half-mad-- \n
He could only bake Bridecake--for which, I may state, \n
No materials were to be had. \n
The last of the crew needs especial remark, \n
Though he looked an incredible dunce: \n
He had just one idea--but, that one being 'Snark,' \n
The good Bellman engaged him at once. \n
He came as a Butcher: but gravely declared, \n
When the ship had been sailing a week, \n
He could only kill Beavers. The Bellman looked scared, \n
And was almost too frightened to speak: \n
But at length he explained, in a tremulous tone, \n
There was only one Beaver on board; \n
And that was a tame one he had of his own, \n
Whose death would be deeply deplored. \n
The Beaver, who happened to hear the remark, \n
Protested, with tears in its eyes, \n
That not even the rapture of hunting the Snark \n
Could atone for that dismal surprise! \n
It strongly advised that the Butcher should be \n
Conveyed in a separate ship: \n
But the Bellman declared that would never agree \n
With the plans he had made for the trip: \n
Navigation was always a difficult art, \n
Though with only one ship and one bell: \n
And he feared he must really decline, for his part, \n
Undertaking another as well. \n
The Beaver's best course was, no doubt, to procure \n
A second-hand dagger-proof coat-- \n
So the Baker advised it-- and next, to insure \n
Its life in some Office of note: \n
This the Banker suggested, and offered for hire \n
(On moderate terms), or for sale, \n
Two excellent Policies, one Against Fire, \n
And one Against Damage From Hail. \n
Yet still, ever after that sorrowful day, \n
Whenever the Butcher was by, \n
The Beaver kept looking the opposite way, \n
And appeared unaccountably shy. \n
Fit the Second \n
THE BELLMAN'S SPEECH \n
The Bellman himself they all praised to the skies-- \n
Such a carriage, such ease and such grace! \n
Such solemnity, too! One could see he was wise, \n
The moment one looked in his face! \n
He had bought a large map representing the sea, \n
Without the least vestige of land: \n
And the crew were much pleased when they found it to be \n
A map they could all understand. \n
'What's the good of Mercator's North Poles and Equators, \n
Tropics, Zones, and Meridian Lines?' \n
So the Bellman would cry: and the crew would reply \n
'They are merely conventional signs! \n
'Other maps are such shapes, with their islands and capes! \n
But we've got our brave Captain to thank: \n
(So the crew would protest) 'that he's bought us the best-- \n
A perfect and absolute blank!' \n
This was charming, no doubt; but they shortly found out \n
That the Captain they trusted so well \n
Had only one notion for crossing the ocean, \n
And that was to tingle his bell. \n
He was thoughtful and grave--but the orders he gave \n
Were enough to bewilder a crew. \n
When he cried 'Steer to starboard, but keep her head larboard!' \n
What on earth was the helmsman to do? \n
Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes: \n
A thing, as the Bellman remarked, \n
That frequently happens in tropical climes, \n
When a vessel is, so to speak, 'snarked.' \n
But the principal failing occurred in the sailing, \n
And the Bellman, perplexed and distressed, \n
Said he had hoped, at least, when the wind blew due East, \n
That the ship would not travel due West! \n
But the danger was past--they had landed at last, \n
With their boxes, portmanteaus, and bags: \n
Yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view, \n
Which consisted to chasms and crags. \n
The Bellman perceived that their spirits were low, \n
And repeated in musical tone \n
Some jokes he had kept for a season of woe-- \n
But the crew would do nothing but groan. \n
He served out some grog with a liberal hand, \n
And bade them sit down on the beach: \n
And they could not but own that their Captain looked grand, \n
As he stood and delivered his speech. \n
'Friends, Romans, and countrymen, lend me your ears!' \n
(They were all of them fond of quotations: \n
So they drank to his health, and they gave him three cheers, \n
While he served out additional rations). \n
'We have sailed many months, we have sailed many weeks, \n
(Four weeks to the month you may mark), \n
But never as yet ('tis your Captain who speaks) \n
Have we caught the least glimpse of a Snark! \n
'We have sailed many weeks, we have sailed many days, \n
(Seven days to the week I allow), \n
But a Snark, on the which we might lovingly gaze, \n
We have never beheld till now! \n
'Come, listen, my men, while I tell you again \n
The five unmistakable marks \n
By which you may know, wheresoever you go, \n
The warranted genuine Snarks. \n
'Let us take them in order. The first is the taste, \n
Which is meager and hollow, but crisp: \n
Like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist, \n
With a flavor of Will-o-the-wisp. \n
'Its habit of getting up late you'll agree \n
That it carries too far, when I say \n
That it frequently breakfasts at five-o'clock tea, \n
And dines on the following day. \n
'The third is its slowness in taking a jest. \n
Should you happen to venture on one, \n
It will sigh like a thing that is deeply distressed: \n
And it always looks grave at a pun. \n
'The fourth is its fondness for bathing-machines, \n
Which is constantly carries about, \n
And believes that they add to the beauty of scenes-- \n
A sentiment open to doubt. \n
'The fifth is ambition. It next will be right \n
To describe each particular batch: \n
Distinguishing those that have feathers, and bite, \n
And those that have whiskers, and scratch. \n
'For, although common Snarks do no manner of harm, \n
Yet, I feel it my duty to say, \n
Some are Boojums--' The Bellman broke off in alarm, \n
For the Baker had fainted away. \n
Fit the Third \n
THE BAKER'S TALE \n
They roused him with muffins--they roused him with ice-- \n
They roused him with mustard and cress-- \n
They roused him with jam and judicious advice-- \n
They set him conundrums to guess. \n
When at length he sat up and was able to speak, \n
His sad story he offered to tell; \n
And the Bellman cried 'Silence! Not even a shriek!' \n
And excitedly tingled his bell. \n
There was silence supreme! Not a shriek, not a scream, \n
Scarcely even a howl or a groan, \n
As the man they called 'Ho!' told his story of woe \n
In an antediluvian tone. \n
'My father and mother were honest, though poor--' \n
'Skip all that!' cried the Bellman in haste. \n
'If it once becomes dark, there's no chance of a Snark-- \n
We have hardly a minute to waste!' \n
'I skip forty years,' said the Baker, in tears, \n
'And proceed without further remark \n
To the day when you took me aboard of your ship \n
To help you in hunting the Snark. \n
'A dear uncle of mine (after whom I was named) \n
Remarked, when I bade him farewell--' \n
'Oh, skip your dear uncle!' the Bellman exclaimed, \n
As he angrily tingled his bell. \n
'He remarked to me then,' said that mildest of men, \n
' 'If your Snark be a Snark, that is right: \n
Fetch it home by all means--you may serve it with greens, \n

('That's exactly the method,' the Bellman bold \n
In a hasty parenthesis cried, \n
'That's exactly the way I have always been told \n
That the capture of Snarks should be tried!') \n
' 'But oh, beamish nephew, beware of the day, \n
If your Snark be a Boojum! For then \n
You will softly and suddenly vanish away, \n
And never be met with again!' \n
'It is this, it is this that oppresses my soul, \n
When I think of my uncle's last words: \n
And my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl \n
Brimming over with quivering curds! \n
'It is this, it is this--' 'We have had that before!' \n

In a moment (of this I am sure), \n
I shall softly and suddenly vanish away-- \n
And the notion I cannot endure!' \n
Fit the fourth \n
THE HUNTING \n
The Bellman looked uffish, and wrinkled his brow. \n
'If only you'd spoken before! \n
It's excessively awkward to mention it now, \n
With the Snark, so to speak, at the door! \n
'We should all of us grieve, as you well may believe, \n
If you never were met with again-- \n
But surely, my man, when the voyage began, \n
You might have suggested it then? \n
'It's excessively awkward to mention it now-- \n
As I think I've already remarked.' \n
And the man they called 'Hi!' replied, with a sigh, \n
'I informed you the day we embarked. \n
'You may charge me with murder--or want of sense-- \n
(We are all of us weak at times): \n
But the slightest approach to a false pretense \n
Was never among my crimes! \n
'I said it in Hebrew--I said it in Dutch-- \n
I said it in German and Greek: \n
But I wholly forgot (and it vexes me much) \n
That English is what you speak!' \n
''Tis a pitiful tale,' said the Bellman, whose face \n
Had grown longer at every word: \n
'But, now that you've stated the whole of your case, \n
More debate would be simply absurd. \n
'The rest of my speech' (he explained to his men) \n
'You shall hear when I've leisure to speak it. \n
But the Snark is at hand, let me tell you again! \n
'Tis your glorious duty to seek it! \n
'To seek it with thimbles, to seek it with care; \n
To pursue it with forks and hope; \n
To threaten its life with a railway-share; \n
To charm it with smiles and soap! \n
'For the Snark's a peculiar creature, that won't \n
Be caught in a commonplace way. \n
Do all that you know, and try all that you don't: \n
Not a chance must be wasted to-day! \n
'For England expects--I forbear to proceed: \n
'Tis a maxim tremendous, but trite: \n
And you'd best be unpacking the things that you need \n
To rig yourselves out for the fight.' \n
Then the Banker endorsed a blank check (which he crossed), \n
And changed his loose silver for notes. \n
The Baker with care combed his whiskers and hair, \n
And shook the dust out of his coats. \n
The Boots and the Broker were sharpening a spade-- \n
Each working the grindstone in turn: \n
But the Beaver went on making lace, and displayed \n
No interest in the concern: \n
Though the Barrister tried to appeal to its pride, \n
And vainly proceeded to cite \n
A number of cases, in which making laces \n
Had been proved an infringement of right. \n
The maker of Bonnets ferociously planned \n
A novel arrangement of bows: \n
While the Billiard-marker with quivering hand \n
Was chalking the tip of his nose. \n
But the Butcher turned nervous, and dressed himself fine, \n
With yellow kid gloves and a ruff-- \n
Said he felt it exactly like going to dine, \n
Which the Bellman declared was all 'stuff.' \n
'Introduce me, now there's a good fellow,' he said, \n
'If we happen to meet it together!' \n
And the Bellman, sagaciously nodding his head, \n
Said 'That must depend on the weather.' \n
The Beaver went simply galumphing about, \n
At seeing the Butcher so shy: \n
And even the Baker, though stupid and stout, \n
Made an effort to wink with one eye. \n
'Be a man!' said the Bellman in wrath, as he heard \n
The Butcher beginning to sob. \n
'Should we meet with a Jubjub, that desperate bird, \n
We shall need all our strength for the job!' \n
Fit the Fifth \n
THE BEAVER'S LESSON \n
They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care; \n
They pursued it with forks and hope; \n
They threatened its life with a railway-share; \n
They charmed it with smiles and soap. \n
Then the Butcher contrived an ingenious plan \n
For making a separate sally; \n
And fixed on a spot unfrequented by man, \n
A dismal and desolate valley. \n
But the very same plan to the Beaver occurred: \n
It had chosen the very same place: \n
Yet neither betrayed, by a sign or a word, \n
The disgust that appeared in his face. \n
Each thought he was thinking of nothing but 'Snark' \n
And the glorious work of the day; \n
And each tried to pretend that he did not remark \n
That the other was going that way. \n
But the valley grew narrow and narrower still, \n
And the evening got darker and colder, \n
Till (merely from nervousness, not from goodwill) \n
They marched along shoulder to shoulder. \n
Then a scream, shrill and high, rent the shuddering sky, \n
And they knew that some danger was near: \n
The Beaver turned pale to the tip of its tail, \n
And even the Butcher felt queer. \n
He thought of his childhood, left far far behind-- \n
That blissful and innocent state-- \n
The sound so exactly recalled to his mind \n
A pencil that squeaks on a slate! \n
''Tis the voice of the Jubjub!' he suddenly cried. \n
(This man, that they used to call 'Dunce.') \n
'As the Bellman would tell you,' he added with pride, \n
'I have uttered that sentiment once. \n
''Tis the note of the Jubjub! Keep count, I entreat; \n
You will find I have told it you twice. \n
'Tis the song of the Jubjub! The proof is complete, \n
If only I've stated it thrice.' \n
The Beaver had counted with scrupulous care, \n
Attending to every word: \n
But it fairly lost heart, and outgrabe in despair, \n
When the third repetition occurred. \n
It felt that, in spite of all possible pains, \n
It had somehow contrived to lose count, \n
And the only thing now was to rack its poor brains \n
By reckoning up the amount. \n
'Two added to one--if that could but be done,' \n
It said, 'with one's fingers and thumbs!' \n
Recollecting with tears how, in earlier years, \n
It had taken no pains with its sums. \n
'The thing can be done,' said the Butcher, 'I think. \n
The thing must be done, I am sure. \n
The thing shall be done! Bring me paper and ink, \n
The best there is time to procure.' \n
The Beaver brought paper,portfolio, pens, \n
And ink in unfailing supplies: \n
While strange creepy creatures came out of their dens, \n
And watched them with wondering eyes. \n
So engrossed was the Butcher, he heeded them not, \n
As he wrote with a pen in each hand, \n
And explained all the while in a popular style \n
Which the Beaver could well understand. \n
'Taking Three as the subject to reason about-- \n
A convenient number to state-- \n
We add Seven, and Ten, and then multiply out \n
By One Thousand diminished by Eight. \n
'The result we proceed to divide, as you see, \n
By Nine Hundred and Ninety Two: \n
Then subtract Seventeen, and the answer must be \n
Exactly and perfectly true. \n
'The method employed I would gladly explain, \n
While I have it so clear in my head, \n
If I had but the time and you had but the brain-- \n
But much yet remains to be said. \n
'In one moment I've seen what has hitherto been \n
Enveloped in absolute mystery, \n
And without extra charge I will give you at large \n
A Lesson in Natural History.' \n
In his genial way he proceeded to say \n
(Forgetting all laws of propriety, \n
And that giving instruction, without introduction, \n
Would have caused quite a thrill in Society), \n
'As to temper the Jubjub's a desperate bird, \n
Since it lives in perpetual passion: \n
Its taste in costume is entirely absurd-- \n
It is ages ahead of the fashion: \n
'But it knows any friend it has met once before: \n
It never will look at a bride: \n
And in charity-meetings it stands at the door, \n
And collects--though it does not subscribe. \n
' Its flavor when cooked is more exquisite far \n
Than mutton, or oysters, or eggs: \n
(Some think it keeps best in an ivory jar, \n
And some, in mahogany kegs:) \n
'You boil it in sawdust: you salt it in glue: \n
You condense it with locusts and tape: \n
Still keeping one principal object in view-- \n
To preserve its symmetrical shape.' \n
The Butcher would gladly have talked till next day, \n
But he felt that the lesson must end, \n
And he wept with delight in attempting to say \n
He considered the Beaver his friend. \n
While the Beaver confessed, with affectionate looks \n
More eloquent even than tears, \n
It had learned in ten minutes far more than all books \n
Would have taught it in seventy years. \n
They returned hand-in-hand, and the Bellman, unmanned \n
(For a moment) with noble emotion, \n
Said 'This amply repays all the wearisome days \n
We have spent on the billowy ocean!' \n
Such friends, as the Beaver and Butcher became, \n
Have seldom if ever been known; \n
In winter or summer, 'twas always the same-- \n
You could never meet either alone. \n
And when quarrels arose--as one frequently finds \n
Quarrels will, spite of every endeavor-- \n
The song of the Jubjub recurred to their minds, \n
And cemented their friendship for ever! \n
Fit the Sixth \n
THE BARRISTER'S DREAM \n
They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care; \n
They pursued it with forks and hope; \n
They threatened its life with a railway-share; \n
They charmed it with smiles and soap. \n
But the Barrister, weary of proving in vain \n
That the Beaver's lace-making was wrong, \n
Fell asleep, and in dreams saw the creature quite plain \n
That his fancy had dwelt on so long. \n
He dreamed that he stood in a shadowy Court, \n
Where the Snark, with a glass in its eye, \n
Dressed in gown, bands, and wig, was defending a pig \n
On the charge of deserting its sty. \n
The Witnesses proved, without error or flaw, \n
That the sty was deserted when found: \n
And the Judge kept explaining the state of the law \n
In a soft under-current of sound. \n
The indictment had never been clearly expressed, \n
And it seemed that the Snark had begun, \n
And had spoken three hours, before any one guessed \n
What the pig was supposed to have done. \n
The Jury had each formed a different view \n
(Long before the indictment was read), \n
And they all spoke at once, so that none of them knew \n
One word that the others had said. \n
'You must know ---' said the Judge: but the Snark exclaimed 'Fudge!' \n
That statute is obsolete quite! \n
Let me tell you, my friends, the whole question depends \n
On an ancient manorial right. \n
'In the matter of Treason the pig would appear \n
To have aided, but scarcely abetted: \n
While the charge of Insolvency fails, it is clear, \n
If you grant the plea 'never indebted.' \n
'The fact of Desertion I will not dispute; \n
But its guilt, as I trust, is removed \n
(So far as related to the costs of this suit) \n
By the Alibi which has been proved. \n
'My poor client's fate now depends on you votes.' \n
Here the speaker sat down in his place, \n
And directed the Judge to refer to his notes \n
And briefly to sum up the case. \n
But the Judge said he never had summed up before; \n
So the Snark undertook it instead, \n
And summed it so well that it came to far more \n
Than the Witnesses ever had said! \n
When the verdict was called for, the Jury declined, \n
As the word was so puzzling to spell; \n
But they ventured to hope that the Snark wouldn't mind \n
Undertaking that duty as well. \n
So the Snark found the verdict, although, as it owned, \n
It was spent with the toils of the day: \n
When it said the word 'GUILTY!' the Jury all groaned, \n
And some of them fainted away. \n
Then the Snark pronounced sentence, the Judge being quite \n
Too nervous to utter a word: \n
When it rose to its feet, there was silence like night, \n
And the fall of a pin might be heard. \n
'Transportation for lift' was the sentence it gave, \n
'And *then* to be fined forty pound.' \n
The Jury all cheered, though the Judge said he feared \n
That the phrase was not legally sound. \n
But their wild exultation was suddenly checked \n
When the jailer informed them, with tears, \n
Such a sentence would have not the slightest effect, \n
As the pig had been dead for some years. \n
The Judge left the Court, looking deeply disgusted: \n
But the Snark, though a little aghast, \n
As the lawyer to whom the defense was entrusted, \n
Went bellowing on to the last. \n
Thus the Barrister dreamed, while the bellowing seemed \n
To grow every moment more clear: \n
Till he woke to the knell of a furious bell, \n
Which the Bellman rang close at his ear. \n
Fit the Seventh \n
THE BANKER'S FATE \n
They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care; \n
They pursued it with forks and hope; \n
They threatened its life with a railway-share; \n
They charmed it with smiles and soap. \n
And the Banker, inspired with a courage so new \n
It was matter for general remark, \n
Rushed madly ahead and was lost to their view \n
In his zeal to discover the Snark \n
But while he was seeking with thimbles and care, \n
A Bandersnatch swiftly drew nigh \n
And grabbed at the Banker, who shrieked in despair, \n
For he knew it was useless to fly. \n
He offered large discount--he offered a check \n
(Drawn 'to bearer') for seven-pounds-ten: \n
But the Bandersnatch merely extended its neck \n
And grabbed at the Banker again. \n
Without rest or pause--while those frumious jaws \n
Went savagely snapping around- \n
He skipped and he hopped, and he floundered and flopped, \n
Till fainting he fell to the ground. \n
The Bandersnatch fled as the others appeared \n
Led on by that fear-stricken yell: \n
And the Bellman remarked 'It is just as I feared!' \n
And solemnly tolled on his bell. \n
He was black in the face, and they scarcely could trace \n
The least likeness to what he had been: \n
While so great was his fright that his waistcoat turned white- \n
A wonderful thing to be seen! \n
To the horror of all who were present that day. \n
He uprose in full evening dress, \n
And with senseless grimaces endeavored to say \n
What his tongue could no longer express. \n
Down he sank in a chair--ran his hands through his hair-- \n
And chanted in mimsiest tones \n
Words whose utter inanity proved his insanity, \n
While he rattled a couple of bones. \n
'Leave him here to his fate--it is getting so late!' \n
The Bellman exclaimed in a fright. \n
'We have lost half the day. Any further delay, \n
And we sha'nt catch a Snark before night!' \n
Fit the Eighth \n
THE VANISHING \n
They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care; \n
They pursued it with forks and hope; \n
They threatened its life with a railway-share; \n
They charmed it with smiles and soap. \n
They shuddered to think that the chase might fail, \n
And the Beaver, excited at last, \n
Went bounding along on the tip of its tail, \n
For the daylight was nearly past. \n
'There is Thingumbob shouting!' the Bellman said, \n
'He is shouting like mad, only hark! \n
He is waving his hands, he is wagging his head, \n
He has certainly found a Snark!' \n
They gazed in delight, while the Butcher exclaimed \n
'He was always a desperate wag!' \n
They beheld him--their Baker--their hero unnamed-- \n
On the top of a neighboring crag. \n
Erect and sublime, for one moment of time. \n
In the next, that wild figure they saw \n
(As if stung by a spasm) plunge into a chasm, \n
While they waited and listened in awe. \n
'It's a Snark!' was the sound that first came to their ears, \n
And seemed almost too good to be true. \n
Then followed a torrent of laughter and cheers: \n
Then the ominous words 'It's a Boo-' \n
Then, silence. Some fancied they heard in the air \n
A weary and wandering sigh \n
Then sounded like '-jum!' but the others declare \n
It was only a breeze that went by. \n
They hunted till darkness came on, but they found \n
Not a button, or feather, or mark, \n
By which they could tell that they stood on the ground \n
Where the Baker had met with the Snark. \n
In the midst of the word he was trying to say, \n
In the midst of his laughter and glee, \n
He had softly and suddenly vanished away--- \n
For the Snark *was* a Boojum, you see. \n<|endoftext|>
hunting \n
I throw my gun in the back of my truck \n
With it I hope to kill a 12-point buck \n
While in the woods, BANG! I see the deer fall \n
I take him home, freeze the meat, and mount his horns on my wall \n
I grab my pole and tackle box and head to the lake \n
At this time in the morning, I feel barely awake \n
There is no school today, I’m glad there is no class \n
A mighty tug on my line, I hook a large mouth bass \n
There is nothing like hunting; waiting for the kill \n
Cutting and cleaning the meat my freezer I’ll soon fill \n
Deer steaks and deer jerky have such a great taste \n
And with his head on my wall nothing goes to waste \n
I like fishing, fishing is fun \n
Fishing underneath the rising sun \n
I like catching the fish and putting them in a net \n
Fish is a great dish when the table is set \n
My truck is unstoppable; it can’t beat \n
I slam the door and strap myself in the seat \n
I start the engine and press the gas to the floor \n
My truck takes off and my engine lets out a roar \n
I wouldn’t be able to hunt or fish if it wasn’t for my truck \n
With it I carry poles, guns, and my fallen buck \n
I pull my boat with my truck in four-wheel-drive \n
At my destination I always arrive \n<|endoftext|>
hunting \n
Pitch black outside, ten below zero, \n
Man I am freezing cold; \n
My age is starting to creep up on me, \n
and boy am I feeling old. \n
But as the sky starts to lighten, \n
once black starts to turn blue; \n
My heart starts to beat a little faster, \n
my energy and strength are renewed. \n
Then I see the ducks in the distance, \n
take off for their morning flight; \n
I no longer notice the cold, \n
as I keep the ducks in my sight. \n
Slowly I start to call, \n
I see the ducks look my way; \n
Their checkin out my decoy spread, \n
and the safety that is displayed. \n
They circle once, they circle twice, \n
Then I see them cup their wings; \n
They are going to try and land, \n
oh what happiness this brings. \n
Ten feet or so from the water, \n
just before they land; \n
I bring my shotgun to my shoulder, \n
and steady it with my hands; \n
I squeeze the trigger slowly, \n
and let my steel shot fly; \n
My aim is true, my shot is perfect, \n
I watch the ducks fall from the sky. \n<|endoftext|>
hunting \n
(This is a fictional poem) \n
When my friend and I went deer hunting, I accidentally shot a doe. \n
If you're wondering if I got away with it, the answer is no. \n
It was a bad day for me to lose my glasses. \n
The game warden saw us and he kicked our asses. \n
We got the crap beat out of us even though it was two against one. \n
After beating us to a bloody pulp, he put a second hole in our butts with my gun. \n
We had to sleep on our stomachs for weeks, it was terrible to go through. \n
We went through all of that misery and we didn't even get some damn venison stew. \n<|endoftext|>
hunting \n
Hunting season is coming up \n
And deer is your main prey \n
Wear bright colors, so you wont get stuck \n
Taking your life away \n
When sitting in a tree stand \n
Or walking along with others \n
Make sure what you see is not a man \n
Waiting for deer in a gutter \n
Safety is the most important thing \n
When hunting with a bow or a gun \n
A terrible tragedy they can bring \n
When using them just for fun \n
So take my advise and play it safe \n
Hunting is not a game \n
Take your time, it's not a race \n
The results will still be the same \n<|endoftext|>

The Bellman's Speech \n
The Bellman himself they all praised to the skies-- \n
Such a carriage, such ease and such grace! \n
Such solemnity, too! One could see he was wise, \n
The moment one looked in his face! \n
He had bought a large map representing the sea, \n
Without the least vestige of land: \n
And the crew were much pleased when they found it to be \n
A map they could all understand. \n
"What's the good of Mercator's North Poles and Equators, \n
Tropics, Zones, and Meridian Lines?" \n
So the Bellman would cry: and the crew would reply \n
"They are merely conventional signs! \n
"Other maps are such shapes, with their islands and capes! \n
But we've got our brave Captain to thank" \n
(So the crew would protest) "that he's bought us the best-- \n
A perfect and absolute blank!" \n
This was charming, no doubt: but they shortly found out \n
That the Captain they trusted so well \n
Had only one notion for crossing the ocean \n
And that was to tingle his bell. \n
He was thoughtful and grave--but the orders he gave \n
Were enough to bewilder a crew. \n
When he cried "Steer to starboard, but keep her head larboard!" \n
What on earth was the helmsman to do? \n
Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes: \n
A thing, as the Bellman remarked, \n
That frequently happens in tropical climes, \n
When a vessel is, so to speak, "snarked". \n
But the principal failing occurred in the sailing, \n
And the Bellman, perplexed and distressed, \n
Said he had hoped, at least, when the wind blew due East, \n
That the ship would not travel due West! \n
But the danger was past--they had landed at last, \n
With their boxes, portmanteaus, and bags: \n
Yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view \n
Which consisted of chasms and crags. \n
The Bellman perceived that their spirits were low, \n
And repeated in musical tone \n
Some jokes he had kept for a season of woe-- \n
But the crew would do nothing but groan. \n
He served out some grog with a liberal hand, \n
And bade them sit down on the beach: \n
And they could not but own that their Captain looked grand, \n
As he stood and delivered his speech. \n
"Friends, Romans, and countrymen, lend me your ears!" \n
(They were all of them fond of quotations: \n
So they drank to his health, and they gave him three cheers, \n
While he served out additional rations). \n
"We have sailed many months, we have sailed many weeks, \n
(Four weeks to the month you may mark), \n
But never as yet ('tis your Captain who speaks) \n
Have we caught the least glimpse of a Snark! \n
"We have sailed many weeks, we have sailed many days, \n
(Seven days to the week I allow), \n
But a Snark, on the which we might lovingly gaze, \n
We have never beheld till now! \n
"Come, listen, my men, while I tell you again \n
The five unmistakable marks \n
By which you may know, wheresoever you go, \n
The warranted genuine Snarks. \n
"Let us take them in order. The first is the taste, \n
Which is meagre and hollow, but crisp: \n
Like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist, \n
With a flavour of Will-o'-the-Wisp. \n
"Its habit of getting up late you'll agree \n
That it carries too far, when I say \n
That it frequently breakfasts at five-o'clock tea, \n
And dines on the following day. \n
"The third is its slowness in taking a jest. \n
Should you happen to venture on one, \n
It will sigh like a thing that is deeply distressed: \n
And it always looks grave at a pun. \n
"The fourth is its fondness for bathing-machines, \n
Which it constantly carries about, \n
And believes that they add to the beauty of scenes-- \n
A sentiment open to doubt. \n
"The fifth is ambition. It next will be right \n
To describe each particular batch: \n
Distinguishing those that have feathers, and bite, \n
From those that have whiskers, and scratch. \n
"For, although common Snarks do no manner of harm, \n
Yet I feel it my duty to say \n
Some are Boojums--" The Bellman broke off in alarm, \n
For the Baker had fainted away. \n<|endoftext|>

The measure of love, in truth, is this: \n
To treasure each sigh, close by, then kiss! \n
I've revelled each girl I yearn, \n
Just to discern \n
The measure of love! \n
Soft embraces, gazes... \n
In search for one true friend... \n
Let go... then watching love grow... \n
Then lips pressed tight, just right, \n
As if our two hearts said, 'Hello! ' \n
Love prays this is so... \n
The measure is true in gentlemen... \n
Right out of the blue! So who knows when? \n
It's meant to astound you, too... \n
So you can view \n
The measure of love! \n<|endoftext|>

Here sits a boy so in love with this girl, \n
But he won't say a word cause it sets him in a whirl. \n
And it won't stop spinning untill he can find \n
some rest, reassurance or peace of mind, \n
That this girl that he loves so very much wil be in his arms \n
to hold and touch. \n
All that he wants is for this girl to caress \n
But he can't possibly cause his heads such a mess. \n
And he desperatley longs and hopes for the day that he can openly but honestly say, \n
'i love you more than anythingelse, even more than life itself'. \n<|endoftext|>
love \n
I once was asked concerning love versus hate \n
Why does it seem that hate is so great? \n
While hate is a very strong emotion too \n
Nothing can equal love that is true \n
The weight of hate is very heavy to bear \n
While it seems like love is lighter than air \n
Accounts of hate make a big news headline \n
While actions of love you must look hard to find \n
But when you consider that love is patient, kind, \n
Envieth not, not pompous, not puffed up, not rude, \n
Seeketh not her own, slow to anger, thinks no evil, \n
Rejoices not in wrong doing, but rejoices in the truth, \n
Bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, \n
Endures all things, and never fails* \n
You soon learn that the density of love is so much, \n
Although the scales be heaped with a great volume of hate \n
It's catapulted by a mere measure of love's touch, \n
Love strengthens the bearer so one feels not its weight \n

Though your soul vanished in the sky but my love never dies for you \n
I tell those angels how much I love you and care for you \n
and ask them to make your soul always happy till I come to you \n
My love, I am crying for you because my love turned blue \n
Looking at your photos and wish you were here with me \n
Crying for your endless love which become the end of story \n
I will not see you again but your memories will stay for ever \n
Now my heart fighting against a raw pain for the lost of my love \n
My love, I am crying for you because my love turned blue \n<|endoftext|>
love \n
I do not love you except because I love you; \n
I go from loving to not loving you, \n
From waiting to not waiting for you \n
My heart moves from cold to fire. \n
I love you only because it's you the one I love; \n
I hate you deeply, and hating you \n
Bend to you, and the measure of my changing love for you \n
Is that I do not see you but love you blindly. \n
Maybe January light will consume \n
My heart with its cruel \n
Ray, stealing my key to true calm. \n
In this part of the story I am the one who \n
Dies, the only one, and I will die of love because I love you, \n
Because I love you, Love, in fire and blood. \n<|endoftext|>

Love you in the morning! \n
Love you in the evening, \n

Love gives you admiration, \n
Yet love takes your animation! \n

love \n
Hard is the love couples share as they try to reveal the love they share- \n
The words aren't there, hard to find, hard to seek. Love is hard and also blind when you try to hide, and when you know its there. \n
Love is hard the up and downs, highs and lows, tares and snares \n
Hard to show and let them know the ones who know nothing about you \n
or the ones you can't stand are the ones who you should love \n
If you had show some form of love that one person you needed, was not \n
there now you are should've, could've, would've \n
because there was no love in your heart, hard love is the main thing of - \n
this world we live in \n
Love is hard in the place we call earth, Love isn't found not from \n
our indiviual peers, but from the citizens of America \n
Harder is love, hate comes easy \n
Is love hard because we don't know how or is love harder because \n
we don't care? \n
Love is blind- which is hard, hard to give, or hard to recieve \n
Which is harder Love or Hate? \n
I say love because we know its there but we simply ignore the presence of love, and hide in the darkness of the shadows of the issues of the world, only to hope on the light of LoVe. \n<|endoftext|>

love \n
_________Author's Prologue____________ \n
Originally written for my (then) 12 year old daughter \n
on her challenge for me to write a rhyming poem in \n
less than ten minutes, with a love theme story line to \n
boot... this is what I was able to conjure up. As a rule \n
I am not a great fan of rhyming poetry, tho' I have \n
written some over the years. However, in this one \n
special case I must admit indulging in my daughter's \n
challenge...and was very glad that I took her up on it. \n
Now,24, she still rides me now and again in how she \n
conned me into writing a rhyming love poem! It was on \n
the PH Top 500 Poems List from 2006-2012(topping out at \n
#68) in 2007. Unfortunately, the work was accidently deleted by me, \n
so, I thought I'd resurrect it one more time...........FjR \n
LOVE...Is...LOVE...Is...LOVE... \n
I t's the kiss......before the goodnight \n
It's the bliss after dimming the light \n
It's the memories....of special day's \n
It's the tempering.....clouds of grey \n
It's the turn.....of one's other cheek \n
It's the silence before the arm reach \n
It's the excitement of your first date \n
It's the enlightenment..... you create \n
It's the shoes...you leave at the door \n
It's the muse.....you call your amour \n
It's the sharing.....of wine and seeds \n
It's the caring...to honor and please \n
It's the start of your day's in the sun \n
It's the hearts of 2......that beat as 1 \n
It's the diamond shopping...at Kay's \n
It's the roses........on Valentine's Day \n
It's the sunset.......you nestled under \n
It's the lightning.....'fore the thunder \n
It's the morning they call 'The After' \n
It's the yawning.....and the laughter \n
It's the healing.......of passions scars \n
It's the feeling its cures' in the heart \n
It's the action of words..you profess \n
It's the passion.......and nothing less \n
It's the passion.......and nothing less \n

Re: HEAT WAVE \n
Dear Sir, we've had enough. \n
Do you forget, I think you do, perhaps, \n
Our temperate position on the maps? \n
Daily we mourn the collar's swift collapse, \n
The limp and wrinkled cuff. \n
Dear Sir, we've got to work. \n
We cannot all lie idle on the beach, \n
Or skim, white- winged, the river's limpid reach. \n
We've got to buy and sell, to talk and teach, \n
Although we'd like to shirk. \n
Think of the crowded street, \n
The roar, the clatter, and the throbbing head \n
Where shout and clash, and jangle meet and spread, \n
And thought is irksome and the brain is lead \n
And asphalt grills the feet. \n
Now don't get in a huff. \n
Pity the pain the stifling town endures, \n
A bracing rain will work a thousand cures. \n
Believe me, Sir, obediently yours \n
P.S. We've had enough. \n<|endoftext|>

The weather warming up a bit it's getting warm today \n
And people for the weekend will be heading for the bay \n
To do a bit of fishing and relax by the sea \n
To surf or go skin diving or have a sea side tea. \n
It's nice to leave suburbia it's nice to get away \n
If only for the weekend for a brief holiday \n
To walk along the tide line salt water to your knees \n
or sit back from the high cliffs and feel the ocean breeze. \n
A weekend from suburbia to breathe the ocean air \n
To lay out on the sand dunes on beach reclining chair \n
A short break from pollution and the humid and noisy street \n
Down by the country coast line a different sort of heat. \n
November is upon us and Summer days are nigh \n
And weather getting warmer the weather glass is high \n
And not one sign of rain cloud in blue and sunny sky \n
And myna's song sounds sweeter as Spring goes laughing by. \n
The traffic will be heavy on the coastal highway \n
From 4 p m till after dark on evening of friday \n
As people leave suburbia mum, dad and family \n
And drive towards coastal country town for weekend by the sea. \n<|endoftext|>

About the weather here \n

Looking out through the window \n
Father is trying to forecast the weather \n
And he has been saying something \n
But no one heard what the exact words are \n
For he's talking to no one, but himself. \n
Oh! how terrible things are here \n

Dear Love, where the red lilies blossomed and grew \n
The white snows are falling; \n
And all through the woods where I wandered with you \n
The loud winds are calling; \n
And the robin that piped to us tune upon tune, \n
Neath the oak, you remember, \n
O'er hill-top and forest has followed the June \n
And left us December. \n
He has left like a friend who is true in the sun \n
And false in the shadows; \n
He has found new delights in the land where he's gone, \n
Greener woodlands and meadows. \n
Let him go! what care we? let the snow shroud the lea, \n
Let it drift on the heather; \n
We can sing through it all: I have you, you have me. \n
And we'll laugh at the weather. \n
The old year may die and a new year be born \n
That is bleaker and colder: \n
It cannot dismay us; we dare it, we scorn, \n
For our love makes us bolder. \n

I \n
The August day you wake to takes you by surprise. \n
Its bitterness. Black sullen clouds. Brackish downpour. \n
A drift-net of wetness enmeshes the rented cottage, \n
towels and children’s swimwear sodden on the line. \n
Dry-gulleted drains gulp down neat rain. \n
Drops bounce from a leaking gutter with hard, \n
uncompromising slaps: and, like resignation \n
in the face of death, you contemplate winter \n
with something close to tenderness, the sprint \n
from fuel shed to back door, the leisurely \n
ascent of peat smoke, even the suburban haze \n
of boiler flues when thermostats are set. \n
You warm to those thoughts as you sit there, \n
brainstorming ways to keep the family amused, \n
plans abandoned for barefoot games on dry sand. \n
Handcraft shops? Slot-machine arcades? Hotel grills? \n
In truth - manipulating toast crumbs backwards, \n
forwards at the unsteady table’s edge - you’d prefer \n
to return to your bed as if with some mild \n
ailment, pampered by duvet, whiskey, cloves. \n
II \n
Let it rain. \n
Let the clouds discharge their contents like reserve tanks. \n
Let the worms burrow their way to the topsoil \n
from whatever dank Sargasso they were spawned in. \n
Let dampness rot the coffin-boards of the summer house. \n
Let the shrubs lose their foothold in the wind, \n
the nettles lose their edge, the drenched rat \n
with slicked-back hair scuttle to its sewage pipe. \n
Let the tropical expanses of the rhubarb leaves \n
serve as an artificial pond, a reservoir. \n
Let the downpour’s impact on the toolshed be akin \n
to the dull applause on an archive recording of a love duet. \n
Let the bricklayers at the building site wrap \n
pathetic sheets of polythene around doomed foundations. \n
Let the limb ripped from the tree’s socket \n
hover fleetingly in the air, an olive branch. \n
Let a rainbow’s fantail unfurl like a bird of paradise. \n
Let a covenant be sealed, its wording watertight. \n
Let the floods recede. \n
Let there be light. \n
III after Giacomo Leopardi \n
The storm runs out of wind; nature, which \n
abhors a silence, fills the vacancy with birdsong. \n
Deserting the airless, low-ceilinged coop, \n
the hen repeats herself ad infinitum. Replenished \n
like the rain-barrels, hearts grow sanguine. \n
Hammering resumes. Humming. Gossip. Croons. \n
Sun strides down lanes that grass has repossessed, \n
takes a shine to the brasses at the hotel where, \n
by the window she thrust open, the chambermaid \n
is marvelling at the cleansed freshness, calm. \n
Balm of mind and body. Will we ever feel \n
more reconciled to life than now, ever \n
know a moment more conducive to new hopes, \n
eager beginnings, auspicious starts? \n
How easily pleased we are. Rescind \n
the threat of torment for the briefest \n
second and we blot out dark nights of the soul \n
when lightning flashes fanned by wind \n
ignited fire and brimstone visions. \n
Sorrow is perennial; happiness, a rare \n
bloom, perfumes the air - so that we breathe \n
with the ease of a camphor-scented chest \n
from which congestion has just lifted. \n
Lack of woe equates with rapture then, \n
though not till death will pain take full leave \n
of our senses, grant us permanent relief. \n<|endoftext|>
weather \n
To-day, fair Thisbe, winsome girl! \n
Strays o'er the meads where daisies blow, \n
Or, ling'ring where the brooklets purl, \n
Laves in the cool, refreshing flow. \n
To-morrow, Thisbe, with a host \n
Of amorous suitors in her train, \n
Comes like a goddess forth to coast \n
Or skate upon the frozen main. \n
To-day, sweet posies mark her track, \n
While birds sing gayly in the trees; \n
To-morrow morn, her sealskin sack \n
Defies the piping polar breeze. \n
So Doris is to-day enthused \n
By Thisbe's soft, responsive sighs, \n
And on the morrow is confused \n
By Thisbe's cold, repellent eyes. \n<|endoftext|>
sky \n
The sunset was like a fire-sky \n
That truly lit up my world \n
Clouds were orange and yellow \n
Like a paintbrush making swirls \n
The beauty was overwhelming \n
But a little bit frightening as well \n
It raged as though with fury \n
As it all began to swell \n
The colors were also reflected \n
In the lake where trees surround \n
It was quiet as I stood mesmerized \n
There was barely a single sound \n
I saw some fellows out fishing \n
Their bodies in semi-dark \n
Nothing looked quite real \n
The lake looked cold and stark \n
I doubt that I will ever see \n
A sunset just like this again \n
The entire sky so unimaginable \n
In a shocking kind of blend! \n<|endoftext|>
sky \n
Pines against the sky, \n
Pluming the purple hill; \n
Pines . . . and I wonder why, \n
Heart, you quicken and thrill? \n
Wistful heart of a boy, \n
Fill with a strange sweet joy, \n
Lifting to Heaven nigh - \n
Pines against the sky. \n
Palms against the sky, \n
Failing the hot, hard blue; \n
Stark on the beach I lie, \n
Dreaming horizons new; \n
Heart of my youth elate, \n
Scorning a humdrum fate, \n
Keyed to adventure high - \n
Palms against the sky. \n
Oaks against the sky, \n
Ramparts of leaves high-hurled, \n
Staunch to stand and defy \n
All the winds of the world; \n
Stalwart and proud and free, \n
Firing the man in me \n
To try and again to try - \n
Oaks against the sky. \n
Olives against the sky \n
Of evening, limpidly bright; \n
Tranquil and soft and shy, \n
Dreaming in amber light; \n
Breathing the peace of life, \n
Ease after toil and strife . . . \n
Hark to their silver sigh! \n
Olives against the sky. \n
Cypresses glooming the sky, \n
Stark at the end of the road; \n
Failing and faint am I, \n
Lief to be eased of my load; \n
There where the stones peer white \n
in the last of the silvery light, \n
Quiet and cold I'll lie - \n
Cypresses etching the sky. \n
Trees, trees against the sky - \n
O I have loved them well! \n
There are pleasures you cannot buy, \n
Treasurers you cannot sell, \n
And not the smallest of these \n
Is the gift and glory of trees. . . . \n
So I gaze and I know now why \n
It is good to live - and to die. . . . \n
Trees and the Infinite Sky. \n<|endoftext|>
sky \n
I must confess that this is my first time \n
seeing the leaves change in fall. \n
I laid on my back \n
under a rather large tree today, \n
and what a marvel it was. \n
He laid next to me, \n
yet was overly consumed \n
by the fact that he might get dirt in his eye. \n
For me, it was a much \n
greater feeling. \n
I stared in amazement \n
at the oranges leaves \n
and contrasting blue sky. \n
It's funny how a moment like that \n
could make me realize how wrong \n
we are for each other. \n
While I was busy enjoying \n
the feeling of the cool ground \n
that was my matress \n
and staring up at the leaves until they lost \n
their definition and blurred together, \n
he only seemed to wiggle and squirm, \n
as if he was annoyed or embarassed \n
of committing such a childish act. \n
Today, I learned the reason \n
why he tells me that I'm immature. \n
It's because I am an artist, \n
I see beauty in everything. \n
I am a poet \n
who reads more than just words. \n
I find joy in taking \n
the time to smell the roses - \n
to be amused by the little things. \n
And he has only found \n
a path by following \n
the others. \n<|endoftext|>
sky \n
sunlight bathes in the sky, \n
morning cleans the stagnant \n

road twists, \n
bows beneath the pressure, \n

a destination. \n
sunday paper arrives \n
two days late, \n
or am i just four days early- \n
dreamt last night i carried your child, \n
the birth came too early, you blamed me \n
for the miscarriage. \n
take my child away \n
i am unfit, \n
i am not worthy to \n
bear the pregnancy of \n

a virgin knocked up, \n
who would believe? \n
i said it was a miracle, \n
you said it was just a dream. \n
i look at you, \n
scared little boy, \n
almost tall enough to pass as \n
a gentle man- \n
spinning around theidea \n
of our children in your head. \n
maybe we could move beside the ocean \n
and pay our tithing to the boiling fire-set \n
maybe we could live deep in the country, \n
a native country where no one \n
would know our names and \n
we'd learn to speak the language- \n
maybe we could love each other, \n
just barely enough to be more \n
than we are alone \n<|endoftext|>

Sky and Cloud, \n
is like a kiss, \n
together, sometimes gentle or passionate. \n
Oh on the blue background sky, \n
Cloud, the life-quenching, floating oasis passes by, \n
fluffy white to miles dark and high, \n
to down and down \n
droplets for earth to soak in, \n
then rising back up to sky and cloud again. \n
Oh, beyond the marketplaces, crowds, \n
beyond the cities, valley towns, \n
far from demanding human wants and needs, \n
at the wellspring of imaginations, creeds. \n
Above where red-tailed hawk still flies, \n
or out where the flowing river winds, ... \n
Sky and Cloud, \n
is like a kiss, \n
together, sometimes loud or delicate. \n
Yes, Sky and Cloud, \n
yes, is like, a kiss, ... \n
What gives us Life, ...to feel, exist. \n
''It is clear that the material world \n
of tools and the creative mind is inevitable. \n
What is not clear is when One's heart and senses, \n

sky \n
Gazing into a starry night, \n
I see a deep indigo sky \n
with perfect placement of twinkling light. \n
Stars reveal the expanse of time \n
from before the birth of humanity; \n
their existence came from dynamic energy \n
which was created by spoken word \n
that no man has ever heard. \n
Solitary spirit of awesome might \n
painted this heavenly canvas \n
with a flick of His hand and uttered thought. \n
Divine creation shared with you and me - \n
It's part of our heritage and His eternal legacy. \n

sky \n
Clouds in the sky they are made out of love, \n
Nature is the artist magnificent; \n
Everything there, isn't heavy and above, \n
And made rather fluffy in the distant. \n
I guess everybody has a dream cloud, \n
Where there's a wishing rainbow coming to shine; \n
Though sometimes we are in doubt, and not allowed, \n
To know where it is, cause the weaving's so fine. \n
All unwritten love's upon a cloud somewhere, \n
Just waiting for us to go and catch it; \n
And we, equally waiting for love to share, \n
Just step by step, and little bit by bit. \n
Cupid's flying about with his arrows, \n
Giving happy moments - drying sorrows... \n<|endoftext|>
sky \n
Let my soul, a shining tree, \n
Silver branches lift towards thee, \n
Where on a hallowed winter’s night \n
The clear-eyed angels may alight. \n
And if there should be tempests in \n
My spirit, let them surge like din \n
Of noble melodies at war; \n
With fervour of such blades of triumph as are \n
Flashed in white orisons of saints who go \n
On shafts of glory to the ecstasies they know. \n<|endoftext|>
sky \n
Black rolls the phantom chimney-smoke \n
Beneath the wintry moon; \n
For miles on miles, by sound unbroke, \n
The world lies wrapt in its ermine cloak, \n
And the night's icy swoon \n
Sways earthward in great brimming wells \n
Of luminous, frosty particles. \n
Far up the roadway, drifted deep, \n
Where frost-etched fences gleam; \n
Beneath the sky's wan, shimmering sleep \n
My solitary way I keep \n
Across the world's white dream; \n
The only living moving thing \n
In all this mighty slumbering. \n
Up in the eastern range of hill, \n
The thin wood spectrally \n
Stirs in its sleep and then is still \n
(Like querulous age) at the wind's will. \n
My shadow doggedly \n
Follows my footsteps where I go, \n
A grotesque giant on the snow. \n
Out where the river's arms are wound, \n
And icy sedges cling, \n
There comes to me as in a swound \n
A far-off clear, thin, vibrant sound,-- \n
The distant hammering \n
Of frost-elves as they come and go, \n
Forging, in silver chains, his woe. \n
I stand upon the hill's bleak crest \n
And note the far night world: \n
The mighty lake whose passionate breast, \n
Manacled into arctic rest, \n
In shrouded sleep is furled: \n
The steely heavens whose wondrous host \n
Wheel white from flaming coast to coast. \n
Then down the night's dim luminous ways, \n
Meseems they come once more, \n
Those great star-watchers of old days \n
The lonely, calm-ones, whose still gaze, \n
On old-time, orient shore, \n
Dreamed in the wheeling sons of light, \n
The awful secrets of earth's night. \n
They come, those lofty ones of old, \n
And take me by the hand, \n
And call me brother; ages rolled \n
Are but a smoke-mist; kindred-souled, \n
They lift me to their band; \n
Like lights that from pale starbeams shine, \n
Their clear eyes look with peace on mine. \n
In language of no common kind \n
These watchers speak to me; \n
Their thoughts the depths of heaven find \n
Like plummets true. It were a kind \n
Of immortality \n
To spend with them one holy hour, \n
And know their love and grasp their power. \n
And wrapt around with glad content, \n
I learn with soul serene, \n
Caught from the beauty that is blent \n
In earth, the heaven's luminous tent, \n
The frost-lit dreams between, \n
And something holier out of sight, \n
Glad visions of the infinite. \n
Then backward past the sere hill's breast, \n
The spectral moaning wood, \n
With great peace brooding in my breast, \n
I turn me toward the common rest \n
Of earth's worn brotherhood; \n
But as I pass, a sacred sign, \n
Each lays his holy lips on mine:-- \n
Gives me the golden chrism of song, \n
Tips my hushed heart with fire; \n
Till high in heaven I hear that throng \n
Who march in mystic paths along, \n
Great Pleiades, The Lyre, \n
The Te-Deum of the ages swell, \n
To earth-tuned ear inaudible. \n<|endoftext|>
sky \n
Between me and the sunset, like a dome \n
Against the glory of a world on fire, \n
Now burned a sudden hill, \n
Bleak, round, and high, by flame-lit height made higher, \n
With nothing on it for the flame to kill \n
Save one who moved and was alone up there \n
To loom before the chaos and the glare \n
As if he were the last god going home \n
Unto his last desire. \n
Dark, marvelous, and inscrutable he moved on \n
Till down the fiery distance he was gone, \n
Like one of those eternal, remote things \n
That range across a man’s imaginings \n
When a sure music fills him and he knows \n
What he may say thereafter to few men,— \n
The touch of ages having wrought \n
An echo and a glimpse of what he thought \n
A phantom or a legend until then; \n
For whether lighted over ways that save, \n
Or lured from all repose, \n
If he go on too far to find a grave, \n
Mostly alone he goes. \n
Even he, who stood where I had found him, \n
On high with fire all round him, \n
Who moved along the molten west, \n
And over the round hill’s crest \n
That seemed half ready with him to go down, \n
Flame-bitten and flame-cleft, \n
As if there were to be no last thing left \n
Of a nameless unimaginable town,— \n
Even he who climbed and vanished may have taken \n
Down to the perils of a depth not known, \n
From death defended though by men forsaken, \n
The bread that every man must eat alone; \n
He may have walked while others hardly dared \n
Look on to see him stand where many fell; \n
And upward out of that, as out of hell, \n
He may have sung and striven \n
To mount where more of him shall yet be given, \n
Bereft of all retreat, \n
To sevenfold heat,— \n
As on a day when three in Dura shared \n
The furnace, and were spared \n
For glory by that king of Babylon \n
Who made himself so great that God, who heard, \n
Covered him with long feathers, like a bird. \n
Again, he may have gone down easily, \n
By comfortable altitudes, and found, \n
As always, underneath him solid ground \n
Whereon to be sufficient and to stand \n
Possessed already of the promised land, \n
Far stretched and fair to see: \n
A good sight, verily, \n
And one to make the eyes of her who bore him \n
Shine glad with hidden tears. \n
Why question of his ease of who before him, \n
In one place or another where they left \n
Their names as far behind them as their bones, \n
And yet by dint of slaughter toil and theft, \n
And shrewdly sharpened stones, \n
Carved hard the way for his ascendency \n
Through deserts of lost years? \n
Why trouble him now who sees and hears \n
No more than what his innocence requires, \n
And therefore to no other height aspires \n
Than one at which he neither quails nor tires? \n
He may do more by seeing what he sees \n
Than others eager for iniquities; \n
He may, by seeing all things for the best, \n
Incite futurity to do the rest. \n
Or with an even likelihood, \n
He may have met with atrabilious eyes \n
The fires of time on equal terms and passed \n
Indifferently down, until at last \n
His only kind of grandeur would have been, \n
Apparently, in being seen. \n
He may have had for evil or for good \n
No argument; he may have had no care \n
For what without himself went anywhere \n
To failure or to glory, and least of all \n
For such a stale, flamboyant miracle; \n
He may have been the prophet of an art \n
Immovable to old idolatries; \n
He may have been a player without a part, \n
Annoyed that even the sun should have the skies \n
For such a flaming way to advertise; \n
He may have been a painter sick at heart \n
With Nature’s toiling for a new surprise; \n
He may have been a cynic, who now, for all \n
Of anything divine that his effete \n
Negation may have tasted, \n
Saw truth in his own image, rather small, \n
Forbore to fever the ephemeral, \n
Found any barren height a good retreat \n
From any swarming street, \n
And in the sun saw power superbly wasted; \n
And when the primitive old-fashioned stars \n
Came out again to shine on joys and wars \n
More primitive, and all arrayed for doom, \n
He may have proved a world a sorry thing \n
In his imagining, \n
And life a lighted highway to the tomb. \n
Or, mounting with infirm unsearching tread, \n
His hopes to chaos led, \n
He may have stumbled up there from the past, \n
And with an aching strangeness viewed the last \n
Abysmal conflagration of his dreams,— \n
A flame where nothing seems \n
To burn but flame itself, by nothing fed; \n
And while it all went out, \n
Not even the faint anodyne of doubt \n
May then have eased a painful going down \n
From pictured heights of power and lost renown, \n
Revealed at length to his outlived endeavor \n
Remote and unapproachable forever; \n
And at his heart there may have gnawed \n
Sick memories of a dead faith foiled and flawed \n
And long dishonored by the living death \n
Assigned alike by chance \n
To brutes and hierophants; \n
And anguish fallen on those he loved around him \n
May once have dealt the last blow to confound him, \n
And so have left him as death leaves a child, \n
Who sees it all too near; \n
And he who knows no young way to forget \n
May struggle to the tomb unreconciled. \n
Whatever suns may rise or set \n
There may be nothing kinder for him here \n
Than shafts and agonies; \n
And under these \n
He may cry out and stay on horribly; \n
Or, seeing in death too small a thing to fear, \n
He may go forward like a stoic Roman \n
Where pangs and terrors in his pathway lie,— \n
Or, seizing the swift logic of a woman, \n
Curse God and die. \n
Or maybe there, like many another one \n
Who might have stood aloft and looked ahead, \n
Black-drawn against wild red, \n
He may have built, unawed by fiery gules \n
That in him no commotion stirred, \n
A living reason out of molecules \n
Why molecules occurred, \n
And one for smiling when he might have sighed \n
Had he seen far enough, \n
And in the same inevitable stuff \n
Discovered an odd reason too for pride \n
In being what he must have been by laws \n
Infrangible and for no kind of cause. \n
Deterred by no confusion or surprise \n
He may have seen with his mechanic eyes \n
A world without a meaning, and had room, \n
Alone amid magnificence and doom, \n
To build himself an airy monument \n
That should, or fail him in his vague intent, \n
Outlast an accidental universe— \n
To call it nothing worse— \n
Or, by the burrowing guile \n
Of Time disintegrated and effaced, \n
Like once-remembered mighty trees go down \n
To ruin, of which by man may now be traced \n
No part sufficient even to be rotten, \n
And in the book of things that are forgotten \n
Is entered as a thing not quite worth while. \n
He may have been so great \n
That satraps would have shivered at his frown, \n
And all he prized alive may rule a state \n
No larger than a grave that holds a clown; \n
He may have been a master of his fate, \n
And of his atoms,—ready as another \n
In his emergence to exonerate \n
His father and his mother; \n
He may have been a captain of a host, \n
Self-eloquent and ripe for prodigies, \n
Doomed here to swell by dangerous degrees, \n
And then give up the ghost. \n
Nahum’s great grasshoppers were such as these, \n
Sun-scattered and soon lost. \n
Whatever the dark road he may have taken, \n
This man who stood on high \n
And faced alone the sky, \n
Whatever drove or lured or guided him,— \n
A vision answering a faith unshaken, \n
An easy trust assumed of easy trials, \n
A sick negation born of weak denials, \n
A crazed abhorrence of an old condition, \n
A blind attendance on a brief ambition,— \n
Whatever stayed him or derided him, \n
His way was even as ours; \n
And we, with all our wounds and all our powers, \n
Must each await alone at his own height \n
Another darkness or another light; \n
And there, of our poor self dominion reft, \n
If inference and reason shun \n
Hell, Heaven, and Oblivion, \n
May thwarted will (perforce precarious, \n
But for our conservation better thus) \n
Have no misgiving left \n
Of doing yet what here we leave undone? \n
Or if unto the last of these we cleave, \n
Believing or protesting we believe \n
In such an idle and ephemeral \n
Florescence of the diabolical,— \n
If, robbed of two fond old enormities, \n
Our being had no onward auguries, \n
What then were this great love of ours to say \n
For launching other lives to voyage again \n
A little farther into time and pain, \n
A little faster in a futile chase \n
For a kingdom and a power and a Race \n
That would have still in sight \n
A manifest end of ashes and eternal night? \n
Is this the music of the toys we shake \n
So loud,—as if there might be no mistake \n
Somewhere in our indomitable will? \n
Are we no greater than the noise we make \n
Along one blind atomic pilgrimage \n
Whereon by crass chance billeted we go \n
Because our brains and bones and cartilage \n
Will have it so? \n
If this we say, then let us all be still \n
About our share in it, and live and die \n
More quietly thereby. \n
Where was he going, this man against the sky? \n
You know not, nor do I. \n
But this we know, if we know anything: \n
That we may laugh and fight and sing \n
And of our transience here make offering \n
To an orient Word that will not be erased, \n
Or, save in incommunicable gleams \n
Too permanent for dreams, \n
Be found or known. \n
No tonic and ambitious irritant \n
Of increase or of want \n
Has made an otherwise insensate waste \n
Of ages overthrown \n
A ruthless, veiled, implacable foretaste \n
Of other ages that are still to be \n
Depleted and rewarded variously \n
Because a few, by fate’s economy, \n
Shall seem to move the world the way it goes; \n
No soft evangel of equality, \n
Safe-cradled in a communal repose \n
That huddles into death and may at last \n
Be covered well with equatorial snows— \n
And all for what, the devil only knows— \n
Will aggregate an inkling to confirm \n
The credit of a sage or of a worm, \n
Or tell us why one man in five \n
Should have a care to stay alive \n
While in his heart he feels no violence \n
Laid on his humor and intelligence \n
When infant Science makes a pleasant face \n
And waves again that hollow toy, the Race; \n
No planetary trap where souls are wrought \n
For nothing but the sake of being caught \n
And sent again to nothing will attune \n
Itself to any key of any reason \n
Why man should hunger through another season \n
To find out why ’twere better late than soon \n
To go away and let the sun and moon \n
And all the silly stars illuminate \n
A place for creeping things, \n
And those that root and trumpet and have wings, \n
And herd and ruminate, \n
Or dive and flash and poise in rivers and seas, \n
Or by their loyal tails in lofty trees \n
Hang screeching lewd victorious derision \n
Of man’s immortal vision. \n
Shall we, because Eternity records \n
Too vast an answer for the time-born words \n
We spell, whereof so many are dead that once \n
In our capricious lexicons \n
Were so alive and final, hear no more \n
The Word itself, the living word \n
That none alive has ever heard \n
Or ever spelt, \n
And few have ever felt \n
Without the fears and old surrenderings \n
And terrors that began \n
When Death let fall a feather from his wings \n
And humbled the first man? \n
Because the weight of our humility, \n
Wherefrom we gain \n
A little wisdom and much pain, \n
Falls here too sore and there too tedious, \n
Are we in anguish or complacency, \n
Not looking far enough ahead \n
To see by what mad couriers we are led \n
Along the roads of the ridiculous, \n
To pity ourselves and laugh at faith \n
And while we curse life bear it? \n
And if we see the soul’s dead end in death, \n
Are we to fear it? \n
What folly is here that has not yet a name \n
Unless we say outright that we are liars? \n
What have we seen beyond our sunset fires \n
That lights again the way by which we came? \n
Why pay we such a price, and one we give \n
So clamoringly, for each racked empty day \n
That leads one more last human hope away, \n
As quiet fiends would lead past our crazed eyes \n
Our children to an unseen sacrifice? \n
If after all that we have lived and thought, \n
All comes to Nought,— \n
If there be nothing after Now, \n
And we be nothing anyhow, \n
And we know that,—why live? \n
’Twere sure but weaklings’ vain distress \n
To suffer dungeons where so many doors \n
Will open on the cold eternal shores \n
That look sheer down \n
To the dark tideless floods of Nothingness \n
Where all who know may drown. \n<|endoftext|>
sky \n
There is another sky, \n
Ever serene and fair, \n
And there is another sunshine, \n
Though it be darkness there; \n
Never mind faded forests, Austin, \n
Never mind silent fields— \n
Here is a little forest, \n
Whose leaf is ever green; \n
Here is a brighter garden, \n
Where not a frost has been; \n
In its unfading flowers \n
I hear the bright bee hum: \n
Prithee, my brother, \n
Into my garden come! \n<|endoftext|>

Sky Outside Sky \n
(Two Pairs of Couplets●Quatrain) \n
Tracing the flower soul, night in night \n
Drawing the cloud soul, sky outside sky \n
Moon falling the sparse phoenix tree, love through the ages \n
People invite green willow, the half life time's fate \n

sky \n
Fishes parade \n
across the sky \n
all shapes \n
all sizes \n
thinly disguised \n
as clouds \n
or \n
as you name them \n
“Cloudses! ” \n
Here a big old fish \n
enormous tail...enormous fin. \n
Here a seahorse \n
pretty & perky \n
chomping at the bit. \n
There the tiniest tiniest \n
little wispy fishes alive. \n
The sea itself \n
a sparkle of diamonds…diamonds. \n
Your hand \n
held in mine \n
your mind \n
& how you see this world \n
filling up my mind \n
our... footsteps... following us...in the sand. \n<|endoftext|>
sky \n
Alone \n
we dance \n
beside an endless ocean \n
its waters \n
the music that we dance to \n
the Heavens \n
an endless ocean of stars \n
our love \n
the music of the spheres \n
man & woman \n
woven into one \n
by the magic that we dance \n
we move \n
as one \n
beneath an enormous sky \n
a tiny speck \n
moving through time \n
the stars amazed \n
at how humans \n
not only make \n
but assume their own importance \n
and that they dare \n
to stop Time \n
with nothing but \n
a little scrap of love \n
grasped tightly \n
in their hands. \n<|endoftext|>
sky \n
The sky is an immortal tent built by the Sons of Los: \n
And every space that a man views around his dwelling-place \n
Standing on his own roof or in his garden on a mount \n
Of twenty-five cubits in height, such space is his universe: \n
And on its verge the sun rises and sets, the clouds bow \n
To meet the flat earth and the sea in such an order'd space: \n
The starry heavens reach no further, but here bend and set \n
On all sides, and the two Poles turn on their valves of gold: \n
And if he moves his dwelling-place, his heavens also move \n
Where'er he goes, and all his neighbourhood bewail his loss. \n
Such are the spaces called Earth and such its dimension. \n
As to that false appearance which appears to the reasoner \n
As of a globe rolling through voidness, it is a delusion of Ulro. \n
The microscope knows not of this nor the telescope: they alter \n
The ratio of the spectator's organs, but leave objects untouch'd. \n
For every space larger than a red globule of Man's blood \n
Is visionary, and is created by the Hammer of Los; \n
And every space smaller than a globule of Man's blood opens \n
Into Eternity of which this vegetable Earth is but a shadow. \n
The red globule is the unwearied sun by Los created \n
To measure time and space to mortal men every morning. \n<|endoftext|>
sky \n
Birdy, birdy in the sky \n
Why you do that in my eye \n
I thought you were my friend so true \n
Now I can't see, my eye's like glue! \n<|endoftext|>
sky \n
Walking in the sky, \n
A man in strange black garb \n
Encountered a radiant form. \n
Then his steps were eager; \n
Bowed he devoutly. \n
"My Lord," said he. \n
But the spirit knew him not. \n<|endoftext|>
husband \n
Yes, I have slain, and taken moving life \n
From bodies. Yea! And laughed upon the taking; \n
And, having slain, have whetted still the knife \n
For more and more, and heeded not the making \n
Of things that I was killing. Such 'twas then! \n
But now the thirst so hideous has left me. \n
I live within a coolness, among calm men, \n
And yet am strange. A something has bereft me \n
Of a seeing, and strangely love returns; \n
And old desires half-known, and hanging sorrows. \n
I seem agaze with wonder. Memory burns. \n
I see a thousand vague and sad tomorrows. \n
None sees my sadness. No one understands \n
How I must touch her hair with bloody hands. \n<|endoftext|>
husband \n
What ever happened to the husband and wife \n
What ever happened to love \n
What ever happened to the dreams they thought right \n
That they both thought so much of \n
What ever happened to the holding of hands \n
Or the whispers of secrets to keep \n
Did it somehow slip away with the time \n
Is it somewhere still hidden beneath \n
What ever happened to the words I do \n
Replaced now with words of cruel \n
Does somehow it still linger on \n
Is love only lost and confused \n
What ever happened to the romance \n
And the love that was in each breath we took \n
Must somehow be forgotten now \n
Was this in the chances we took \n
What ever happened to the husband and wife \n
What ever happened to love \n
What will now happen to the rest of our lives \n
For love, was it overlooked \n
What will now happen to the dreams we once had \n
When the world was right at our feet \n
Is love somehow still hidden somewhere \n
Or is this the way it must be \n
There once was a time when it meant so much more \n
When love walked with us in life \n
What ever happened to the love in our hearts \n
What happened to the husband and wife. \n

My Darling can't you see? \n
How very much you mean to me? \n
On this Our day, I've come to say; \n
I love you more and more each day. \n
Mere words alone, cannot express; \n
The love I feel, the tenderness, \n
The joy, and happiness my dear; \n
In knowing you are always near. \n
When you are down, and feeling blue; \n
I hope the sun comes shining through, \n
To cheer you up, and make life glow; \n
Because my dear I love you so. \n
May the Lord bless and keep you in His way; \n
And guide your footsteps day by day; \n
And may your cup of life overflow; \n
Because my dear I love you so. \n<|endoftext|>
husband \n
Thou, who dost all my worldly thoughts employ, \n
Thou pleasing source of all my earthly joy: \n
Thou tend'rest husband, and thou best of friends, \n
To thee this first, this last adieu I send. \n
At length the conqu'ror death asserts his right, \n
And will for ever veil me from thy sight. \n
He wooes me to him with a chearful grace; \n
And not one terror clouds his meagre face. \n
He promises a lasting rest from pain; \n
And shews that all life's fleeting joys are vain. \n
Th' eternal scenes of heav'n he sets in view, \n
And tells me that no other joys are true. \n
But love, fond love, would yet resist his pow'r; \n
Would fain awhile defer the parting hour: \n
He brings thy mourning image to my eyes, \n
And would obstruct my journey to the skies. \n
But say, thou dearest, thou unwearied friend; \n
Say, should'st thou grieve to see my sorrows end? \n
Thou know'st a painful pilgrimage I've past ; \n
And should'st thou grieve that rest is come at last? \n
Rather rejoice to see me shake off life, \n
And die as I have liv'd, thy faithful wife. \n<|endoftext|>

I never knew what love meant until I met you \n
Your always there for me \n
Whenever I need you \n
You worry so much for me \n
And I do too \n
That when we are not together \n
We miss each other all the way through. \n
You always comfort me \n
When I'm sad \n
You try so hard to make me happy \n
Even when I'm mad, \n
I dont know sometimes how you put up with me \n
I guess thats very nice \n
To have a wonderfull husband \n
Always by my side. \n<|endoftext|>
husband \n
Away the startled pheasant flies, \n
With lazy movement of his wings. \n
Borne was my heart's lord from my eyes;-- \n
What pain the separation brings! \n
The pheasant, though no more in view, \n
His cry, below, above, forth sends. \n
Alas! my princely lord, 'tis you-- \n
Your absence, that my bosom rends. \n
At sun and moon I sit and gaze, \n
In converse with my troubled heart. \n
Far, far from me my husband stays! \n
When will he come to heal its smart? \n
Ye princely men who with him mate, \n
Say, mark ye not his virtuous way. \n
His rule is--covet nought, none hate;-- \n
How can his steps from goodness stray? \n<|endoftext|>

My husband Vinny Christensen \n
He's now thirty seven, but he looks younger \n
He has beautiful eyes with his sweet smile \n
Making my heart beats a little faster. \n
He works as technical consultant at Telenor \n
Never felt bored solving problems for his customers \n
He has a lot of wonderful colleagues \n
Ronny, Daniel are so sweet, they are his best partners. \n
Vinny loves so much his music \n
He's fantastic, all the lyrics he wrote \n
He makes wonderful words rhymes \n
Melody's brighten like blue skies, made me cry some time I suppose. \n
He has the rhythms in his heart \n
Writing a song so fast, he is a talented \n
Playing all the music instruments he can \n
Piano, Guitar, Ukelele, etc. I don't understand..Why he's so fascinated! \n
He's now writing me a beautiful song \n
He said not so long he will totally complete it \n
RAE is the name he named his latest song \n
It will be the greatest as it belongs, he makes me really appreciated! \n
I love my husband so much \n
My face is all blushed like a light pink rose \n
He is a perfect wonderful and gently man \n
Like white sparkling sand, he's the man I chose! \n<|endoftext|>

You sleep in the darkness, \n
you with the back I love \n
& the gift of sleeping \n
through my noisy nights of poetry. \n
I have taken other men into my thoughts \n
since I met you. \n
I have loved parts of them. \n
But only you sleep on through the darkness \n
like a mountain where my house is planted, \n
like a rock on which my temple stands, \n
like a great dictionary holding every word- \n
even some \n
I have never spoken. \n
You breathe. \n
The pages of your dreams are riffled \n
by the winds of my writing. \n
The pillow creases your cheek \n
as I cover pages. \n
Element in which I swim \n

silent muse, backbone, companion- \n

to confess to marriage- \n
yet I feel no bondage \n
in this air we share. \n<|endoftext|>

O thou Most High who rulest all \n
And hear'st the prayers of thine, \n
O hearken, Lord, unto my suit \n
And my petition sign. \n
Into Thy everlasting arms Of mercy \n
I commend Thy servant, Lord. \n
Keep and preserve My husband, \n
my dear friend. \n
At Thy command, O Lord, he went, \n
Nor nought could keep him back. \n
Then let Thy promise joy his heart, \n
O help and be not slack. \n
Uphold my heart in Thee, O God. \n
Thou art my strength and stay, \n
Thou see'st how weak and frail I am, \n
Hide not Thy face away. \n
I in obedience to Thy will \n
Thou knowest did submit. \n
It was my duty so to do; \n
O Lord, accept of it. \n
Unthankfulness for mercies past \n
Impute Thou not to me. \n
O Lord, Thou know'st my weak desire \n
Was to sing praise to Thee. \n
Lord, be Thou pilot to the ship \n
And send them prosperous gales. \n
In storms and sickness, Lord, preserve. \n
Thy goodness never fails. \n
Unto Thy work he hath in hand \n
Lord, grant Thou good success \n
And favour in their eyes to whom \n
He shall make his address. \n
Remember, Lord, Thy folk whom Thou \n
To wilderness hast brought; \n
Let not Thine own inheritance \n
Be sold away for nought. \n
But tokens of Thy favour give, \n
With joy send back my dear \n
That I and all Thy servants may \n
Rejoice with heavenly cheer. \n
Lord, let my eyes see once again \n
Him whom Thou gavest me \n
That we together may sing praise \n
Forever unto Thee. \n
And the remainder of our days \n
Shall consecrated be \n
With an engaged heart to sing \n
All praises unto Thee. \n<|endoftext|>

My eyes fill with tears \n
You tell me I'm bad, that I'm a loser \n
You're my husband, you're my abuser \n
I'm afraid to stay... \n
Afraid to leave \n
I'm scared to love you \n
Scared to believe \n
Your behavior keeps me so confused \n
There's so much pain \n
I feel so used \n
You've kept me so long \n
Under your spell \n
My heart feels so lonely \n
I'm as empty as a shell \n
All you gave was pain and sorrow \n
Not much hope for a bright tomorrow \n
Longing for a tender touch \n
A gentle voice \n
Will this painful life be my only choice? \n
A river of tears \n
So many lost years \n
At last, I'm free - I sent you away \n
Now, each nite I vow to pray \n
I thank the Lord for giving me strength \n
From now on - I'll keep you at length \n
You've set me free Lord - You made me brave \n

GRIM monarch! see, depriv'd of vital breath, \n
A young physician in the dust of death: \n
Dost thou go on incessant to destroy, \n
Our griefs to double, and lay waste our joy? \n
Enough thou never yet wast known to say, \n
Though millions die, the vassals of thy sway: \n
Nor youth, nor science, not the ties of love, \n
Nor ought on earth thy flinty heart can move. \n
The friend, the spouse from his dire dart to save, \n
In vain we ask the sovereign of the grave. \n
Fair mourner, there see thy lov'd Leonard laid, \n
And o'er him spread the deep impervious shade. \n
Clos'd are his eyes, and heavy fetters keep \n
His senses bound in never-waking sleep, \n
Till time shall cease, till many a starry world \n
Shall fall from heav'n, in dire confusion hurl'd \n
Till nature in her final wreck shall lie, \n
And her last groan shall rend the azure sky: \n
Not, not till then his active soul shall claim \n
His body, a divine immortal frame. \n
But see the softly-stealing tears apace \n
Pursue each other down the mourner's face; \n
But cease thy tears, bid ev'ry sigh depart, \n
And cast the load of anguish from thine heart: \n
From the cold shell of his great soul arise, \n
And look beyond, thou native of the skies; \n
There fix thy view, where fleeter than the wind \n
Thy Leonard mounts, and leaves the earth behind. \n
Thyself prepare to pass the vale of night \n
To join for ever on the hills of light: \n
To thine embrace this joyful spirit moves \n
To thee, the partner of his earthly loves; \n
He welcomes thee to pleasures more refin'd, \n
And better suited to th' immortal mind. \n<|endoftext|>

Not the blood running its wires of flame through the whole length \n
Not the memories, the texts written in the language of the flat hills \n
No, not the memories, the porch swing and the father crying \n
The genteel and elegant aunt bleeding out on the highway \n
(Too black for the white ambulance to pick up) \n
Who had sent back lacquered plates from China \n
Who had given away her best ivory comb that one time she was angry \n
Not the muscles, the ones the white girls longed to touch \n
But must not (for your mother warned \n
You would be lynched in that all-white Ohio town you grew up in) \n
Not that same town where you were the only, the one good black boy \n
All that is gone \n
Not the muscles running, the baseball flying into your mitt \n
Not the hand that laid itself over my heart and saved me \n
Not the eyes that held the long gold tunnel I believed in \n
Not the restrained hand in love and in anger \n
Not the holding back \n
Not the taut holding \n<|endoftext|>

Not enough time to go drifting along \n
For one has to work eight hours long. \n
Who knows where time goes? \n
No time to laugh --- and just be alone, \n
No time at all for friend or foe. \n
Time is running out --- people all say, \n
Who knows where time goes --- each and every day! \n<|endoftext|>

Some of your classes might be boring, \n
But don’t you dare get caught snoring. \n
Get your homework done, \n
Then go out and have some fun. \n
Go out and party all night long, \n
But don’t forget your report on ping-pong. \n
There is only one solution to it all, \n
Get your homework done in study hall. \n
So when it’s time for school \n
Be cool. \n
Don’t be a fool. \n<|endoftext|>

Time was upon \n
The wing, to fly away; \n
And I call'd on \n
Him but awhile to stay; \n
But he'd be gone, \n
For aught that I could say. \n
He held out then \n
A writing, as he went, \n
And ask'd me, when \n
False man would be content \n
To pay again \n
What God and Nature lent. \n
An hour-glass, \n
In which were sands but few, \n
As he did pass, \n

Mine end near was;-- \n
And so away he flew. \n<|endoftext|>

On the wide level of a mountain's head, \n

Their pinions, ostrich-like, for sails out-spread, \n
Two lovely children run an endless race, \n
A sister and a brother ! \n
This far outstripp'd the other ; \n
Yet ever runs she with reverted face, \n
And looks and listens for the boy behind : \n

Some say that technology moves forward \n
Some say we're loosing knowledge. \n
Some people see gardens of daisies \n

Does each generation move forward? \n
Or are we someday going to find ourselves back at the begining? \n
Some hope for world peace \n

Is time a waste or is Life a waste of time? \n
If suddenly time were to 'stop' \n
No clocks or indications of passing \n

As time passes by, things change with the time, \n
Every moment, hour, day, month, and year, \n
All things have their turn to change with the time, \n
Life, time, and events change with the years. \n
Everyone, everything, have a time and day, \n
A time to change, end, begin a new day, \n
Change is life, the course of life everyday, \n
All things change, and we change with them all days. \n
Only the Eternal one is constant, \n
All things in the universe, inconstant, \n
But despite it all, love is important, \n
The world may change, but true love is constant. \n<|endoftext|>

LONG time I lay in little ease \n
Where, placed by the Turanian, \n
Marseilles, the many-masted, sees \n
The blue Mediterranean. \n
Now songful in the hour of sport, \n
Now riotous for wages, \n
She camps around her ancient port, \n
As ancient of the ages. \n
Algerian airs through all the place \n
Unconquerably sally; \n
Incomparable women pace \n
The shadows of the alley. \n
And high o'er dark and graving yard \n
And where the sky is paler, \n
The golden virgin of the guard \n
Shines, beckoning the sailor. \n
She hears the city roar on high, \n
Thief, prostitute, and banker; \n
She sees the masted vessels lie \n
Immovably at anchor. \n
She sees the snowy islets dot \n
The sea's immortal azure, \n
And If, that castellated spot, \n
Tower, turret, and embrasure. \n<|endoftext|>

Tiny tots eyes will shine on Christmas morn \n
Jolly old St. Nick will arrive, in all the homes \n

But, what's the real meaning of Christmas? \n
It's not just presents we give or get \n
That night in the sky, a star shone over Bethlehem \n
Christ was born on Christmas Day. \n
In a manger because there was no room in the Inn that night \n
The three wise men brought gifts of Gold, Frankincense and myrrh. \n

The sun turns north, the days grow long, \n
Later the evening star grows bright-- \n

Still fight? \n

Always for the first time \n
Hardly do I know you by sight \n
You return at some hour of the night to a house at an angle to my window \n
A wholly imaginary house \n
It is there that from one second to the next \n
In the inviolate darkness \n
I anticipate once more the fascinating rift occurring \n
The one and only rift \n
In the facade and in my heart \n
The closer I come to you \n
In reality \n
The more the key sings at the door of the unknown room \n
Where you appear alone before me \n
At first you coalesce entirely with the brightness \n
The elusive angle of a curtain \n
It's a field of jasmine I gazed upon at dawn on a road in the vicinity of Grasse \n
With the diagonal slant of its girls picking \n
Behind them the dark falling wing of the plants stripped bare \n
Before them a T-square of dazzling light \n
The curtain invisibly raised \n
In a frenzy all the flowers swarm back in \n
It is you at grips with that too long hour never dim enough until sleep \n
You as though you could be \n
The same except that I shall perhaps never meet you \n
You pretend not to know I am watching you \n
Marvelously I am no longer sure you know \n
You idleness brings tears to my eyes \n
A swarm of interpretations surrounds each of your gestures \n
It's a honeydew hunt \n
There are rocking chairs on a deck there are branches that may well scratch you in the forest \n
There are in a shop window in the rue Notre-Dame-de-Lorette \n
Two lovely crossed legs caught in long stockings \n
Flaring out in the center of a great white clover \n
There is a silken ladder rolled out over the ivy \n
There is \n
By my leaning over the precipice \n
Of your presence and your absence in hopeless fusion \n

No need to wait anymore \n

to foreign lands to fight and die, \n
to preserve the rights of freedom, \n

can have the right to live, \n
and not under a tyrant’s hand. \n
They go not as heroes for glory, \n
but to help innocent souls, \n
so they can sleep securely at night. \n
However, the battlefield where they are, \n
hold allsorts of dangers there, \n
some will never return safely home. \n
Their souls will look over \n
the battlefield where they fell, \n
possibly wondering at \n
the folly of it all. \n

a monument with columns of names, \n
remember that their sacrifice \n

You remember Ellen, our hamlet's pride, \n
How meekly she bless'd her humble lot, \n
When the stranger, William, had made her his bride, \n
And love was the light of their lowly cot. \n
Together they toil'd through winds and rains, \n
Till William, at length, in sadness said, \n
"We must seek our fortune on other plains;" -- \n
Then, sighing, she left her lowly shed. \n
They roam'd a long and a weary way, \n
Nor much was the maiden's heart at ease, \n
When now, at close of one stormy day, \n
They see a proud castle among the trees. \n
"To-night," said the youth, "we'll shelter there; \n
The wind blows cold, the hour is late;" \n
So he blew the horn with a chieftain's air, \n
And the porter bow'd, as they passd the gate. \n
"Now, welcome, Lady," exclaim'd the youth, -- \n
"This castle is thine, and these dark woods all!" \n
She believed him crazed, but his words were truth, \n
For Ellen is Lady of Rosna Hall! \n
And dearly the Lord of Rosna loves \n
What William the stranger woo'd and wed; \n
And the light of bliss, in these lordly groves, \n
Shines pure as it did in the lowly shed. \n<|endoftext|>

The best actors in the world get ready in their ghettos for the rehearsal. \n
The beginners have no alternative in this low waged tragedy \n
And they grab the oldest profession. \n
Finally the pussyfoot greedy customers \n
Donate their hidden sicknesses \n
And it seems the each performer gets entr'acte of this chain reaction. \n
I dedicate this poem to the poetess Suzie.Gharib in gratitude. \n
* These stereotyped individuals are the victims of morality and their heartbeat is the Morse code of social imbalance. Life is not easy on this planet earth, though it rotates yet not a Merry-go-round. \n<|endoftext|>
remember \n
Dearest one, do you remember, \n
As we sat side by side, \n
How you told me that you loved me, \n
Asked me to be your bride. \n
And you told me we'd be happy, \n
Through all the years to come, \n
If we ever would prove faithful, \n
As in the days when we were young. \n
Oh! how well do I remember, \n
The kind and loving words, \n
And now as I sat dreaming, \n
The thoughts my memory stirs. \n
But the days have passed before me, \n
And the scenes of long ago, \n
But I can never forget the \n
Days that have passed o'er. \n
Oh! how clearly I remember \n
The days when we were young, \n
How we would tell to each other \n
Of happy times to come, \n
And as we would sit together, \n
That dear loved one and I, \n
Oh, sat dreaming of the future, \n
And childhood days gone by. \n
Dearest love, do you remember \n
The first time that we met -- \n
Our youthful days have gone, love, \n
I hope you love me yet, \n
Now we are growing old, love, \n
Our heads will soon be gray, \n
May we ever love each other \n
Till from earth we pass away. \n<|endoftext|>
remember \n
Remember thee! yes, while there's life in this heart, \n
It shall never forget thee, all lorn as thou art; \n
More dear in thy sorrow, thy gloom, and thy showers, \n
Than the rest of the world in their sunniest hours. \n
Wert thou all that I wish thee, great, glorious, and free, \n
First flower of the earth, and first gem of the sea, \n
I might hail thee with prouder, with happier brow, \n
But oh! could I love thee more deeply tha now? \n
No, thy chains as they rankle, thy blood as it runs, \n
But make thee more painfully dear to thy sons -- \n
Whose hearts, like the young of the desert-bird's nest, \n
Drink love in each life-drop that flows from thy breast. \n<|endoftext|>
remember \n
Remember when \n
the days seemed so long \n
Not a care in the world \n
and all was a song \n
Sit on the front porch \n
and smell the fresh air \n
Summertime pleasures \n
without not a care \n
I long for those days \n
to came back again \n
Sharing our dreams \n
with one special friend \n<|endoftext|>
remember \n
Let Erin remember the days of old, \n
Ere her faithless sons betray'd her; \n
When Malachi wore the collar of gold, \n
Which he won from her proud invader, \n
When her kings, with standard of green unfurl'd, \n
Led the Red-Branch Knights to danger! \n
Ere the emerald gem of the western world \n
Was set in the crown of a stranger. \n
On Lough Neagh's bank as the fisherman strays, \n
When the clear cold eve's declining, \n
He sees the round towers of other days \n
In the wave beneath him shining: \n
Thus shall memory often, in dreams sublime, \n
Catch a glimpse of the days that are over; \n
Thus, sighing, look through the waves of time, \n
For the long-faded glories they cover. \n<|endoftext|>

Whispering echoes of truth \n

Silent reminders of beauty shared \n
I remember you as a kiss \n
A stain of molten lust \n
Capitulating in tumultuous need \n
I remember you as the sea \n
Waves consuming our tryst \n
Rocking in the purity of now \n

And you are low on wad \n
Feeling lonely and sad \n
Right in your backyard \n
Remember \n
Bad times will pass away \n
They may sometimes seem long \n
Hang in there be strong \n
You have done no wrong \n
When you have nothing else to play \n
Except your last joker card \n
And people think you've gone completely mad \n
Please don't resort to being bad \n
Remember \n
Bad times will pass away \n
They may sometimes seem long \n
But are not bound to stay \n
Miracles do happen \n
Only if you and only you believe! \n
For those who love you safely from a distance \n
Remember it for the time \n
When they want your friendship enhanced \n

The fading beam of parting day \n
Forsakes the western sky, \n
Now shines Diana's gentler ray \n
With virgin majesty; \n
Her face with milder glory bright \n
Illumes the dusky shades of night, \n

Pours to the moon her plaintive note \n

These notes of rural music sink \n

The air a voice of triumph chears, \n

On Cherwell's sedgy brink. \n
His azure length of robe behind \n
Loosely wantons in the wind; \n
Glowing like the vernal morning \n
Beams benign his eye-balls shed; \n
Ceres' wealth his brows adorning \n
Shades his venerable head. \n
Say heavenly vision what these notes portend? \n
Sits white-wing'd Victory on Britannia's arms? \n
Does proud Iberia to her legions bend, \n

Siddhartha loved his wife \n
More than his own life. \n
In the pleasure palace, \n
He enjoyed music and dance. \n
Some time he was restless \n
Yashodhara noticed this. \n
But she couldn’t guess, \n
The reason for his worries. \n
Though physically he was \n
With her in their palace, \n
He was elsewhere mentally. \n
Like this, she felt naturally. \n
Outside the pleasure palace, \n
There was something else, \n
Which he had never seen. \n
To see it, he was so keen. \n
But he couldn’t go out \n
As the security was tight. \n
To go out of the palace \n
He waited for a chance. \n
She delivered, one fine morn, \n
As expected, a beautiful son. \n
A messenger made a mention \n
“Oh prince, a son is born.” \n
“Rahula! ” Said the prince, \n
In a low whispering voice, \n
“Obstacle, ” what it meant. \n
The messenger mistook it. \n
It’s a name, what he thought. \n
To the King, he conveyed it. \n
So, they named the child \n
“Rahula, ” as the prince told. \n
As an obstacle, any day, \n
Never Rahula was on his way. \n
He too wasn’t bound, \n
By the new born child. \n
Before his love developed, \n
He had left the child, \n
But was happy, he had a son, \n
As an heir to the throne. \n
Years later, Rahula was one, \n
Among the main disciples ten, \n
So, the word ‘obstacle’ lost \n
What it signified, at last. \n<|endoftext|>

SAINT THYAGARAJA \n
BRIEF INTRODUCTION \n
The Saint Thyagaraja was born on the 4th May,1767 \n
at Tiruvarur, Tanjore District, South India. He came to \n
lead the mankind in the spiritual path through the medium \n
of Classical Music, purely devoted to Lord Rama. He had \n
composed classical songs in thousands during his life time, \n
which are still very popular through out the world. \n
During the period of Vijayanagar Empire in the Central India, \n
which broke down due to frequent invasions from the North \n
India, his ancestors took asylum in the Kingdom ruled by \n
Maratha Nayak in South India. With this brief introduction \n
his life story follows: \n
SAINT THYAGARAJA \n
(04-05-1767 to 06-01-1847) \n
The year seventeen-sixty-seven, \n
Witnessed the divine sanction \n
From the Merciful Heaven \n
For a great saint, who was born. \n
It was on the fourth day, \n
In the month of May, \n
This saint took his birth \n
On this mundane earth. \n
The Temple Town Tiruvarur, \n
Of the District Thanjavur, \n
Became the chosen land, \n
To welcome this child. \n
True to their own custom \n
He was given the name \n
Thyagaraja, the Lord \n
Of this Temple God. \n
‘Thyaga, ’ a word for ‘sacrifice’ \n
‘Raja’ for ‘King or Prince, ’ \n
Thyagaraja, as his name stood, \n
Lived in austerity till his end. \n
He was the third son, \n
The most illustrious one, \n
Of Ramabrahmam, his father, \n
And Seethamma, his mother. \n
The King of Thanjavur \n
Patronized his father, \n
A story teller by profession, \n
And an exponent of Ramayan. \n
As a daughter of a Veena player, \n
Kalahastayya, a royal court performer, \n
Music was in Seethamma's blood \n
And he grew up in this background. \n

birth \n
I \n
This morning I thought how easy \n
it must have been for you \n
to have copied your genetic code \n
in the form of flesh, dated randomly \n
on that bleak day in December \n
when the light had the dull luster \n
of pewter and the blinds had to be drawn. \n
The day ended my tenancy \n
in the womb which you otherwise \n
ripped out of your daily planner, \n
and being the unwanted, the mistake, \n
had given up in offering \n
like the body and blood of Christ. \n
Every day I struggled \n
to carry the weight of a lesson, \n
a refugee of abandonment, reading \n
through the pages of Catechism books \n
just before the Crucifixion, \n
practicing forgiveness. \n
Now, I must live with the side effects \n
of an uncommon childhood \n
like an addiction: a returned identity card, \n
the genetic code lost in the blood of the unborn― \n
those blueprints of family history \n
that build the strong bones of a monument, \n
revised by the thin scrawl of your signature \n
on a line that forever divides. \n
II \n
If to gaze into that mirror \n
as though the glass is convex― \n
if we could first look inward, \n
then outward― \n
if we could study profile like the face \n
of a moon in each of its phases― \n
would we find our identity? \n
How much of you would I see \n
at each angle― full, half, quartered― \n
that I would not have seen \n
in the mirror handed me \n
had its glass not been convex? \n
What do I know of you \n
in my arched brow? \n
In the discharged turmoil \n
of my eye? In a single gesture? \n
What do I know \n
in learning to give up, give back, give away, \n
that I would not have known \n
had I been of the same will? \n
III \n
I cannot find you \n
down those stairways \n
that lead into the deepest catacombs \n
of family history, buried treasure, \n
a chest sealed years ago \n
in the shadow of your footprints; \n
in the dust of light beams \n
through the windows in the hall of records. \n
Nor can I see you in the genetic code \n
that cannot be deciphered― \n
those diseases that will torment the blood, \n
and in the pain that encapsules \n
our time-released lives― \n
although \n
that is where I will find you. \n<|endoftext|>

The Child is rocked on Mary's knee, \n
Cold in the stall this bitter night, \n
And 'Lullalay-loo,' soft singeth she, \n
'My little Boy and Heaven's Delight!' \n
When singing stars went up the sky \n
The Prince of Peace oped a sweet eye. \n
His Highness now how small He lies! \n
He to be God and Very God! \n
A Jacob's ladder spans the skies \n
Whereof each rung is angel-trod, \n
And all their carols are of Peace, \n
Though the sick world hath little ease. \n
Come in, poor war-worn folk, and rest; \n
Kneel where the sinless creatures kneel; \n
The Babe snugged warm in Mother's breast, \n
He is your Wound-Wort, your All-Heal \n
Balsam for hurts that throb and smart, \n
Small Rose of Love on Mary's heart. \n
Shut close within His hand so small \n
The sick heart's medicine; not a sword. \n
Come in, come in, sad people all, \n

When Love was born of heavenly line, \n
What dire intrigues disturbed Cythera's joy! \n
Till Venus cried, 'A mother's heart is mine; \n
None but myself shall nurse my boy,' \n
But, infant as he was, the child \n
In that divine embrace enchanted lay; \n
And, by the beauty of the vase beguiled, \n
Forgot the beverage--and pined away. \n
'And must my offspring languish in my sight?' \n
(Alive to all a mother's pain, \n
The Queen of Beauty thus her court addressed) \n
'No: Let the most discreet of all my train \n
Receive him to her breast: \n
Think all, he is the God of young delight.' \n
Then TENDERNESS with CANDOUR joined, \n
And GAIETY the charming office sought; \n
Nor even DELICACY stayed behind: \n
But none of those fair Graces brought \n
Wherewith to nurse the child--and still he pined. \n
Some fond hearts to COMPLIANCE seemed inclined; \n
But she had surely spoiled the boy: \n
And sad experience forbade a thought \n
On the wild Goddess of VOLUPTUOUS JOY. \n
Long undecided lay th' important choice, \n
Till of the beauteous court, at length, a voice \n
Pronounced the name of HOPE:--The conscious child \n
Stretched forth his little arms, and smiled. \n
'Tis said ENJOYMENT (who averred \n
The charge belonged to her alone) \n
Jealous that HOPE had been preferred \n
Laid snares to make the babe her own. \n
Of INNOCENCE the garb she took, \n
The blushing mien and downcast look; \n
And came her services to proffer: \n
And HOPE (what has not Hope believed!) \n
By that seducing air deceived, \n
Accepted of the offer. \n
It happened that, to sleep inclined, \n
Deluded HOPE: for one short hour \n
To that false INNOCENCE'S power \n
Her little charge consigned. \n
The Goddess then her lap with sweetmeats filled \n
And gave, in handfuls gave, the treacherous store: \n
A wild delirium first the infant thrilled; \n
But soon upon her breast he sunk--to wake no more. \n<|endoftext|>

birth \n
This day, dear Bec, is thy nativity; \n
Had Fate a luckier one, she'd give it ye. \n
She chose a thread of greatest length, \n
And doubly twisted it for strength: \n
Nor will be able with her shears \n
To cut it off these forty years. \n
Then who says care will kill a cat? \n
Rebecca shows they're out in that. \n
For she, though overrun with care, \n
Continues healthy, fat, and fair. \n
As, if the gout should seize the head, \n
Doctors pronounce the patient dead; \n
But, if they can, by all their arts, \n
Eject it to the extremest parts, \n
They give the sick man joy, and praise \n
The gout that will prolong his days. \n
Rebecca thus I gladly greet, \n
Who drives her cares to hands and feet: \n
For, though philosophers maintain \n
The limbs are guided by the brain, \n
Quite contrary Rebecca's led; \n
Her hands and feet conduct her head; \n
By arbitrary power convey her, \n
She ne'er considers why or where: \n
Her hands may meddle, feet may wander, \n
Her head is but a mere by-stander: \n
And all her bustling but supplies \n
The part of wholesome exercise. \n
Thus nature has resolved to pay her \n
The cat's nine lives, and eke the care. \n
Long may she live, and help her friends \n
Whene'er it suits her private ends; \n
Domestic business never mind \n
Till coffee has her stomach lined; \n
But, when her breakfast gives her courage, \n
Then think on Stella's chicken porridge: \n
I mean when Tigerhas been served, \n
Or else poor Stella may be starved. \n
May Bec have many an evening nap, \n
With Tiger slabbering in her lap; \n
But always take a special care \n
She does not overset the chair; \n
Still be she curious, never hearken \n
To any speech but Tiger's barking! \n
And when she's in another scene, \n
Stella long dead, but first the Dean, \n
May fortune and her coffee get her \n
Companions that will please her better! \n
Whole afternoons will sit beside her, \n
Nor for neglects or blunders chide her. \n
A goodly set as can be found \n
Of hearty gossips prating round; \n
Fresh from a wedding or a christening, \n
To teach her ears the art of listening, \n
And please her more to hear them tattle, \n
Than the Dean storm, or Stella rattle. \n
Late be her death, one gentle nod, \n
When Hermes, waiting with his rod, \n
Shall to Elysian fields invite her, \n
Where there will be no cares to fright her! \n<|endoftext|>

The Sunbeam loved the Moonbeam, \n
And followed her low and high, \n
But Moonbeam fled and hid her head, \n
She was so shy – so shy. \n
The Sunbeam wooed with passion; \n
Ah, he was a lover bold! \n
And his heart was afire with mad desire \n
For the moonbeam pale and cold. \n
She fled like a dream before him, \n
Her hair was a shining sheen, \n
And oh, that Fate would annihilate \n
The space that lay between! \n
Just as the day lay panting \n
In the arms of the twilight dim, \n
The Sunbeam caught the one he sought \n
And drew her close to him. \n
But out of his warm arms, startled \n
And stirred by Love’s first shock, \n
She sprang afraid, like a trembling maid, \n
And hid in the niche of a rock. \n
And the Sunbeam followed and found her \n
And led her to Love’s own feast; \n
And they were wed on that rocky bed, \n
And the dying day was priest. \n
And lo! the beautiful Opal – \n
That rare and wondrous gem – \n
Where the moon and the sun blend into one, \n
Is the child that was born to them. \n<|endoftext|>
birth \n
While yet it was the Empire of the Night, \n
And Stars still check'r'd Darkness with their Light, \n
From Temples round the cheerful Bells did ring, \n
But with the Peales a churlish Storm did sing. \n
I slumbr'd; and the Heavens like things did show, \n
Like things which I had seen and heard below. \n
Playing on Harps Angels did singing fly, \n
But through a cloudy and a troubl'd Sky, \n
Some fixt a Throne, and Royal Robes display'd, \n
And then a Massie Cross upon it laid. \n
I wept: and earnestly implor'd to know, \n
Why Royal Ensigns were disposed so. \n
An Angel said, The Emblem thou hast seen, \n
Denotes the Birth-Day of a Saint and Queen. \n
Ah, Glorious Minister, I then reply'd, \n
Goodness and Bliss together do reside \n
In Heaven and thee, why then on Earth below \n
These two combin'd so rarely do we know? \n
He said, Heaven so decrees: and such a Sable Morne \n
Was that, in which the Son of God was borne. \n
Then Mortal wipe thine Eyes, and cease to rave, \n
God darkn'd Heaven, when He the World did save. \n<|endoftext|>
birth \n
The dark hour. \n
Pitch black. \n
The night sparks, \n
with sudden stars. \n
With a glory unattained, \n
the night-shroud whispers \n
to the tumultuous ocean, \n
a longing unknown. \n
Breaks from the unfathomable darkness, \n
chaos of a roaring dawn. \n
stamping its thump \n
in this lonely night sky. \n
An endeavour \n
to sweep the earth off its feet. \n
Leaps of joy, \n
in the boundless ocean. \n
the cumulative sorrow, a burden unshed, \n
smothered in a second. \n
All that was, \n
vanishes… \n
for all that is, to come. \n
and thus ends a creation, \n
to create the uncreated. \n<|endoftext|>
believe \n
Four elements, fire, earth, air and water, \n
Each on the calendar takes a quarter. \n
Fire and water together do not mix, \n
Fire always needs air, for that is its fix. \n
Earth, air and water that is a trio. \n
In what section would we find our Leo. \n
Horoscopes are some peoples obsession, \n
All the forecasts would give one depression. \n
You may believe them or you may not, \n
But quite frankly, I do not care a jot. \n
I’m an Aries and I’m a fiery one. \n
A Ram, well Ewe, when all is said and done. \n
Whatever prediction, for good or ill, \n
Will on a few occasions fit the bill. \n
Astrology will continue to lure, \n
All who feel readings can foretell ‘Amour’. \n

Flooding me with emotions. \n
Tosses me into that special place- \n

Your serene face draws me to tranquility, \n
That’s where I long to belong for eternity. \n

Almost to the level of Supreme Creator of all everywhere! \n
But Nature shows its other face though Moon hides ever! \n
Materialist man has taken for granted Nature's love for all \n
Just us we all breathing air forget ourselves of its existence! \n
Perhaps that's the case Nature shows its wrath of its presence! \n
Nay, man's blunder in exploiting natural resources beyond limit \n
Without any sense of recycling them at all and selling farms \n
For urbanisation of villages Nature shows its wrath so harsh! \n
Instead of thanking Nature's generous gesture man destroys \n
All like the greedy man who killed goose to take all golden eggs! \n<|endoftext|>
greed \n
It's long since I stopped believing in human wisdom. \n
Long since I stopped distinguishing wisdom of the old - and \n
Stupidity of the new generation \n
It's un-intelligible to know what the new generation does differently \n
Within the organismic experiences of life \n
-But isn't this the problem! \n
Or is it that the older generation have become the epitome of every evil? \n
As youths make no decisive legislation \n
On climate change \n
War \n
Waste disposal \n
Gender equality \n
Racism \n
Human trafficking \n
Migration \n
Marriage \n
political repression! \n
The wisdom of the older generation have always reigned! \n
But nothing has changed \n
Many like them drown in the seas, \n
cold and terrified \n
to find solutions \n
The same prematurely die on wetness of their blood in the streets with unwanted wounds. Or stupor \n
I have seen the older-generation diving us into black-holes \n
Of despicable practices in the name of patriotism, religion and color \n
All seemingly wiser \n
and all-knowing \n
Although our conspicuousness rightly haunts us \n
As beneath it all, we know the truth - and it's all on greed \n
It's demonic nature is encapsulated in the tongues of decency \n
and diplomacy - or sometimes - political correctness! \n
It's all in the appetite for repressive power \n
-But isn't this the problem \n
Or should we just believe because they've said, we're the future \n
While we're soothingly killing this uncertain future - who knows? \n
- But isn't that the problem? \n
Or is it that the youth have lost their ways? \n
The youths! \n
They've hardly known what they need! \n
Hardly in control of themselves - most of them are rabid \n
Retracting not from the facade path of the older generation \n
Instead they as their mothers, have become custodians of \n
Hatred \n
Arrogance \n
Drunkenness \n
Confusion \n
Ungodliness like their lost fathers \n
The spring of all evils! \n
-But isn't that the problem? \n
That we've become drawn into darkness \n
As we resent the light? \n
That we question every simplicity of life \n
Preferring to align with its complexities \n
- making life unknown \n
Creating a world Where truth and facts, lies and slanders \n
simply switch places \n
As all we need is who says them and how they say them to us. \n
Where we believe our realities are different and indistinguishable to \n
- Darkness and Light \n
- But isn't this the problem? \n
Or is it the choices we make \n
- and \n
What and Who we are taught \n
To love \n
To hate \n
To despise \n
To assist \n
And religion - But not God - to be loyal to? \n<|endoftext|>

Greed is the biggest threat to our civilization \n
It destroys families and it can bring down the nations \n
Greed is one of the most dangerous desires in human nature \n
It’ so bad that it can turn human to heartless creature \n
Greed is the source of financial and social trouble \n
If is not contain, it can turn earth to the ruble \n
Greedy person doesn’t believe in values and doesn’t feel guilty \n
Money to him is like salt water, as he drinks more he gets more thirsty \n
If human can control his greed \n
Then world become heaven, that’s what we really need \n<|endoftext|>

End of life was in tune \n
Melody that swings somewhere \n
Strange mind swish a hope \n
I need a shoulder to cry on \n
Long years of solitude \n
Awed ways that marched lonely \n
Plead for love in empty corners \n
Thrash that hooked in vagueness of life \n
Find love in a deserted corner \n
Hug it with the disastrous wings \n
As death admired as its part \n
Greed of love that sinks itself \n
Death is a mentor of life and love \n
Span that wait to seize its spark \n
Moves to its mouth with empty hands \n
Contracted love that lilt always \n
Plea for love is the greatest deed \n
String that lies in bottom of heart \n
Sometimes unknown or ignore \n
But hurts as its greed…… \n

greed \n
He wanted to study, but he was forced to work, \n
He had to earn for his family, this, he could not shirk. \n
He used to work hard and bore his family's load, \n
He spent many nights, on the bench by the road. \n
All he begged was for a proper meal, \n
But to help the poor, had nobody the zeal? \n
He tried educating himself without anyone's help, \n
He didn't want to be looked upon as a poor little whelp. \n
He had big dreams of becoming rich and acquiring property, \n
But these were all crushed by one word - poverty. \n
A person shouldn't be judged on the basis of being rich or poor, \n
But one's pride and vanity is what attracts them to this lure. \n
He was rich at heart, but had no money, \n
All people saw was a man who looked funny. \n
He wanted to leave a mark in the world, wanted to make a name, \n
But what stopped him was society's barrier of money, status and fame. \n
He tried to resist them, tried not to hear, \n
He battled his way through and overcame his fears. \n
He was becoming successful, people started to appreciate him, \n
He wanted to achieve more and hence became grim. \n
But soon he realised, he could not get his way, \n
Unless he obliged someone and by luck, got away. \n
He thought once, he thought twice, but still followed his intuition, \n
Knowing, that it would divert him from his mission. \n
He knew what the consequences were very well, \n
But poverty all over again, was just as good as hell. \n
He wasn't himself anymore, he had been consumed by greed, \n
That might've been the reason that led him to commit a misdeed. \n
He had risked it all, unfortunately, luck was not in his favour, \n
But this wrong deed was more than just a misdemeanour. \n
Now in jail, humiliated, bankrupt and full of regret, \n
He stabbed himself and ended his life's vignette. \n
His life could have been better, he could have had it all, \n
If he was happy and unsatisfied, would have just been a squall. \n
He stood at the cliff of goodness, right above the abyss of greed, \n
But it was too tempting, he jumped right into it, all just to bleed. \n<|endoftext|>

The predecessors of humans lived in forests \n
The hunter gatherers they fought with nature and wild \n
But seldom they destroyed the wild, flora and fauna \n
In such vast terms of events the world witnessing. \n
They killed the animals for food and skins \n
And also to protect themselves from their attacks \n
But we the civilized ones opted it for pleasure \n
For making money out of the ill gotten ways \n
By continuing the killing spree as poachers. \n
The bison, wild boars, elephants, and tigers \n
The king of wild the Lion, and the hippos \n
The rhenos, sambars, and beautiful other wildlife \n
Slowly and purposely destructing by fire arms \n
In fact the human being acts as the destiny makers \n
Of all the wild life which is to be objected. \n
This beautiful world and forests are entitled to all \n
For the humans as well as the wildlife we know \n
Save the world from perishes and protect the wildlife \n
As well as the forest which have immense wealth \n
Not only for today or tomorrow but upto the infinite time. \n

Ruining your days with anxieties, lose night after night of sleep, \n
Do shady deals and diddle: then what? Old Granpa Time'll creep \n
In with his scythe, and slice away at your bundle of plans, hank after hank. \n
Death's hidden away, and hunkers inside the clock-tower; \n
And no one can say: Tomorrow, once more I'll \n
Still hear midday ring out like today, at this very same hour. \n
What's the poor pilgrim do when he takes on a rough and tough \n
Journey, knowing he'll travel but for a little while? \n
He packs a crust or two of bread, and that's enough. \n<|endoftext|>

greed \n
Long ago in a far away land \n
Ruled a evil King with a strong hand \n
He was mean and he was cruel \n
Such a man should never rule. \n
He had a daughter and a loving wife \n
Two tall sons and a marvelous life \n
His lack of appreciation for what he had \n
Made the King’s family very sad. \n
Gold coins piled high with plenty for his needs \n
Could not satisfy the King’s vast greed \n
He taxed his Subjects and he stole their land \n
Issuing proclamations full of bold demands \n
The beautiful Princess– no longer a girl \n
Gave her hand in marriage to a handsome Earl \n
Rode away with her husband on a prancing steed \n
Leaving behind the King consumed with greed \n
The oldest son loved adventures, games, and sport \n
He soon grew weary of the boring court \n
Where nothing occupied his royal father’s day \n
But thinking of ways to make his Subjects pay. \n
One fine day the Prince could stand no more \n
Made plans to head for a distant shore \n
Strapped on armor and a sharp-edged sword \n
Sailed far away to fight a distant war. \n
The King took no notice of his children’s flight \n
He sat counting money all through the night \n
The youngest son stopped as he went to bed \n
Stood watching the King and sadly shook his head. \n
The Prince worried about his father – his mother, too. \n
He wished that he knew the best thing to do \n
Nothing good could come of the King’s evil gain \n
Seeing his parents drift apart gave the young man pain. \n
Finally the Queen, with a broken heart \n
Sighed and climbed aboard a rickety cart \n
She used this vehicle to steal away \n
One early morning at the break of day. \n
Riding along behind a long-eared mule \n
She cursed her husband for being a fool. \n
Through the Village Square; past a flowing fountain \n
The Queen drove her mule up a towering mountain. \n
A magical genie lived on the mountaintop \n
Reaching the wizard’s home, the queen did stop. \n
That she would be found, she had no fears, \n
Here the Queen could be safely hidden for years. \n
No one knew the Queen was alive and well - \n
No one but the youngest son who would not tell. \n
The Queen sent her son a note inside an ancient ring \n
and begged him not to tell his father, the King. \n
Sitting in his castle on his massive throne \n
One day the King realized that he was all alone. \n
There was dirt on the windows and on the floor \n
He hadn’t eaten all day – and his stomach was sore. \n
The King cursed loudly and then yelled for his wife \n
She had always cared for the desires of his life \n
“Why has she deserted me? ” the poor man moaned \n
“She could have left a note – or she could have phoned.” \n
Ah, but the Queen was happy and very content \n
She only regretted the lost years she had spent \n
Worshiping at the feet of the man she called “Honey” - \n
Catering to the man who loved nothing but money. \n<|endoftext|>

america \n
The first area to look into is those pillars of American success I identified above: Cheap Labor, Cheap Energy, Cheap Food and a country filled with natural resources. \n
To this list I will now add, a decent birth rate or immigrant flow, small town and technical green enclave investment, income distribution reform, land distribution reforms, banking and financial reforms and a re-thinking of the purposes of an economy. \n
Cheap labor built this country, from the Chinese coming to lay the track for the railroads, to the Africans working the cotton in the South, to the immigrants from Europe who cleared the land in the west, who worked the factories, fought the wars and made America what it is today. Needless to say the labor scene is not the same today. Cheap labor has been outsourced to other countries. \n
The American middle class has not only been abandoned but 40% of American savings were taken from them and their homes, their major asset, are now selling for half the purchase price to those very same interests which took the savings and the land. \n
We are heading for a two class system, therefore, the rich and the poor. Certainly that is the pattern becoming evident in many of our cities. In addition, there is the lack of labor, cheap or otherwise, which is the demographic issue. Americans are not having children, nor are Europeans and the demographics are becoming clear: By 2050, some demographic studies show, the reproducing populations of Russia, Britain, France and Italy will, in essence, cease to exist and the traditional populations will be replaced by immigrants from other countries. The same trends are evident in the United States as well. Latin American birth rates outstrip those of Americans and demography become destiny, in a flice. \n
So, as we age in this country, we see a younger population replacing an older one, of a very different stripe. Our children will learn more Spanish in the short-run but English will have resurgence in the next generation. What is to be done in this context is now our challenge. \n
The first issue in the short run is the economy. The country will, and already has, in certain communities become a two-economy society. Why should I, nor can I, compete for basic living necessities with individuals earning 2-3 times more than I do? \n
A two-economy solution, whether created or defacto-realized seems inevitable. The rich will likely not be allowed to shop in the second economy where the price of necessities can be artificially raised in a so-called 'free market.' This solution creates a low-cost economy of necessities for those who provide the labor. This makes sense and many do this to survive anyway today. Thrift shops, discount stores, Walmarts all attest to the fact that the middle class cannot afford middle class and upper middle class prices. \n
The second pillar of revamping the labor force (the one above creates an economy which works for them) is to have that labor force become more self-sufficient and not be susceptible to being wiped out by Wall Street machinations and global trends in far away countries. This means the re-claiming of productive land and small towns where they can be supportive of a laboring population. Bartering, co-ops, low living costs, plus a land reform policy can make the country side more productive and sustainable especially in the context of greening these small towns to produce energy for re-sale to the grid. \n
Believe it or not Detroit is trying this approach. Tear the detoriated buildings down, down-size the city, allow for population loss, put in self-sufficient gardening and farming plots, bring in technological enclaves. This is an admission that the city model does not work, at least in Detroit. \n
Now you have idle workers in small towns all over the country. We can make those small towns productive with massive investments. How you say is that possible? More tomorrow. \n
February 18,2010 - Survival Chapter Three \n
As I have stated elsewhere our children, will not be able to afford the suburban home of the past. \n
In the cities they will be forced and are, already, living three to five a house or apartment. High unemployment will remain with us and a revamping of the economy from a service emphasis to a new high-tech, green emphasis will take time. What to do. Here are a few modest proposals about what to do with the labor force, idle out there and hurting. \n
1-Create a massive internal peace corp. Put people to work re-vamping small towns for their change-over to a more self-sustaining model. This includes local organic food stuffs, grown and consumed. Free up land for this purpose. People will grow gardens. Put money into green training and irrigation projects. Bring people languishing unproductively in the cities back into these very same small towns. Bring back and support local and regional banks and co-ops of various kinds, crops, loans, machinery, techno co-ops can work if local. \n
Remember what happens when we allow Wall Street to become our bankers? . Take those same highly educated city grads, currently living five to an apartment, and give them money to go back home to their own small towns, or others to help set up the infrastructure need to fuel this internal peace corp re-generation of America. Move people out of the cities with incentives to go back to the small town or the medium sized town. We have technology now where we don't need to congregate in cities to be productive, that was an industrial model where you needed the labor force close and available near ports and transportation hubs. We don't need this so much in this post industrial era. Has this model been tried? Sure. Dependent wage-earners in the city are an economic failure. We should admit it and go local and regional. \n
The poor won't be poor if they are given the means to access the basics of life. The middle class can revert to the community help model that is still in place in many small towns, and has been for centuries. After all, most of the world was a small town model until populations were forced into the cities to serve the needs of robber barons. \n
Now the second aspect of reform is to take the technological enclaves I have described and integrate them into what I have described above. I have noted that much of the information revolution is actually driven by a few high skilled enclaves around the world and by relatively few people. They are Silicon valley-like enclaves in California, China, Singapore, France, Germany, Hong-Kong etc. These enclaves are small towns where participants know one another and exchange ideas. This is the second model of small town regeneration. These type two small towns are to be in contact with type one small towns and can become training cadres for small town re-generation. How? Give them tax breaks to do so and guess what they will have at their disposal; cheap labor from the sources we identified above. That is what we need to do in the short run, town by town. \n
So we have a new source of cheap labor, idle now but can become productive again. Empty the cities, get people out of what are inefficient enclaves and get them to places where the population can begin to benefit itself not a few hundred thousand rich souls who control city life. \n
Ah, not possible you say? The choice here is stark: Either we organize this new re-generation by planful means or it will occur in an unplanned way, which is to say people abandoning the cities and invading the country side looking for the means to survive. Be mindful here that any disaster of any meaningful proportions will initiate this process anyway and we will not have planned for it \n
A last stark fact: The average grocer has three days worth of food on the shelves. People will invade the country side looking for food and this will be the plan I just discussed being initiated the hard way. And that is ugly. \n
The collapse of centralized authority, unplanned, happened with the collapse of the Roman Empire, initiating the Dark Ages, happened, in fact, in the bible as I have argued above, and happened with the collapse of Egyptian rule in Canaan. It happened with Katrina. Any breakdown from natural or man-made sources will create the pattern I describe above. \n
February 22,2010 'What Does America Need To Survive? ' Chapter 4 \n
Have there been other examples of civilizations abandoning the city as unworkable; or central authority collasping, of abandoning empire as unworkable? The Mayans abandoned pyramid building, the Greeks, the Babylonians, the French, the British, the Romans, countless examples. Most large scale centralized authority systems fall down. They are not generally pulled down. The most recent example is that of the Russians who abandoned their empire as unworkable. \n
It is part of a normal pattern. \n
So now to get to the detail. Include the army in the small town regeneration project, along with the young and the college-educated. Many of them have ties to these small towns and it would be a home coming. Have the technological enclaves close by with small towns providing labor in exchange for training. Isn't that what the Army does anyway? Focus efforts in regeneration on greening and self-sufficiency. These would be key. This would mean small truck farms, wind, solar and the techno-enclave would be in proximity. And, ultimately, able to produce energy for the gird. \n
Of course, there will be a fight over the land. Currently developers, banks, railroads, utilities and the US government own most of the land in the country. There would have to be a new land use policy. Survival is at stake. But the fight could be won because small states dominate in the US Senate and a deal could be struck because their states would benefit from such a plan. \n
Think of it. Most of the wasted resources in this country are utilized keeping the cities afloat. They are not economic, crime ridden, have no real products they produce, have teeming unemployment looming and bound to get worse and net resource wasters. They demand massive investments in transportation, food, energy and give little back in terms of long-term sustainability. Young people, the idle, the technologically advanced are better utilized on the country-side landscape. Just a thought. \n
So cheap labor is possible to put back into the American equation. As I am fond of saying, this will happen well and planned or ill-planned and ugly. \n
February 26,2010 'Survive' \n
The next item in tandem is cheap energy. Above we have mentioned wind and solar. We add to the list battery power, and nuclear power. There are ideas around the idea of clean coal and cheap oil, but we are better off looking at fuel substitutes that include vegetable oils and other grain based fuels. At the very least stockpiles ought to be created for the emergencies which will surely come in the future. But will all this be enough, timely and efficient in the face of climate change, aging populations, declining incomes, looming depression, and political paralysis? Such timing is critical, the answer is unknown. However, we have no choice in the energy field; we must act as if we will succeed. The overall goal is clear; create a society which city and country-side produce net energy give-backs to the grid. \n
Friends of mine stated part of the problem succinctly, “Why re-build an outmoded infrastructure; build the new one directly.' \n
On the energy level the task is a delicate one: We have to build the boat we are sailing to Europe on while sailing to Europe. The reason that this is even to be looked at is that you can do this if you build the boat as a series of rafts strung together. Those rafts are small towns. Seen this way, it is possible to accomplish the task. Of course there is not enough money in the world to re-build the old infrastructure, but a green infra-structure is possible under scenarios I outline below. That structure is cheaper in the long run, more competitive, locally controlled and has cheaper labor costs, as I have outlined above. \n
The next issue is cheap food. America has long been the bread basket of the world but that small-farmer model of production has long been replaced by big agriculture which now means genetic farming where corn itself has reduced strains available and many of them owned, repeat, owned by the Monsanto's of the world. It is illegal to grow the corn without their permission. This, of course, changes the cheap food equation. If grain seed and indeed water, and the very air can become private property then the house of cards will collapse. Clearly this system is not sustainable and is not viable as a public good. \n
Re-generation will have to be accompanied by a re-thinking of who owns food grains. Who owns water, land, air? It is instructive to even have to discuss these issues this way. What hath progress wrought? \n
How can food be re-democratized? It will have to be. Hungry people will find a way to feed their families and Monsanto and their patents will have to stand aside and let people grow what ever they want. \n
Now a potential catalyst in all of this are returning veterans from our two wars. (War is a form of employment which is why it so easily becomes popular.) \n
These folks, having made sacrifices for the country will come home, assuming the wars end, will need jobs and there are none. They will need medical care, in a medical system which is broken. They will need re-training, in a country which is cutting college budgets. Something similar happened after World War one and those vets marched on Washington. It can happen again. These might when they and their families find they cannot make a living once back home. They are good candidates for re-generation projects where living costs will be lower and green re-training possible. \n
But the potential volatility of that issue remains. The two economy solution will become more apparent with these veterans back home. After all we have an example of this with the military itself where the internal military economy runs on it own terms not those of the general American economy. \n
So what then is the next issue to be solved? We need to look at small town economic models and their regional counterparts. Tomorrow. \n
February 27,2010 'Survive' \n
The economic picture is glum, but things will sort themselves out well or badly. Let's concentrate on well. The first item many of you have mentioned is the issue of where will the money come from to institute many of the ideas I have outlined above. Bob mentioned the national debt, two wars, and a trillion dollar deficit. All true. The national debt is 12.4 trillion dollars and soon the interest payments against that debt will be the second largest item in the national budget. \n
What will happen? What can happen? Can we or our children pay this debt? No, not right now. \n
What will likely happen is either default or re-structuring. We owe the money to the Chinese and the Japanese mostly and we will likely simply restructure with both and create new lower payments. They might, and likely will agree, to the extent they can see their exports increase to us in our re-generation efforts here. They could get some debt funds paid back in that way, along with currency re-valuation in the Chinese example. And guess who will be in China, utilizing that cheap labor-US companies who can produce for the US market utilizing this foreign labor and also help create that green market back home as well. This has synergy. Sloppy synergy but yes synergy. Inevitable? No. But a logical path. \n
The two wars cost about 120 billion a year and have to be wound down slowly so as to not exacerbate all those towns dependent upon military contracts in the United States and all those countries dependent upon US military bases abroad. We are a war-dependent economy seeking to become a peace economy that will take time, say 20 years. \n
So the first step in economic re-generation will be the global changes described above from the perspective of the United States. We can't pay. Besides we need the money for the internal changes above or we pay in internal disruptions from economic chaos if we don't act. Think 20 rolling Katrina's due to water shortages in one case, food shortages in another case, rising inflation which make the dollar worth a lot less, transportation breakdowns, terrorist attacks etc. \n
We are a fragile over-technologized society, and so interdependent that five airplanes can bring our economy to its knees. This is not good. \n
Now the small town answer here is therefore a good idea not only for economic reasons but for strict military reasons as well. Ninety-five percent of the people living on one percent of the land is a bad idea militarily. Disbursement is a better idea. \n
Now the mix we are talking about here is one of small-town, regional and yes some cities where cities make sense. But the basis of the American future has to be local, upgraded with technology, not massed populations in vulnerable cities. Re-generation is re-building America from the bottom up and abandoning top-down systems. \n
So how much time will this all take and what are the barriers? \n
March 1,2010 'Survival' \n
A wise sage once said 'What to do is easy, but the first step of what to do is the problem.' The same is true here. The answer to the question of how long we have to accomplish certain critical first steps is a function of how long will the first steps take. And what are those first steps? Here we go: \n
The country has to be put on a disaster footing, whether that disaster is any of the calamities I have described above or some one not yet conceived. Here is what I think we have to do, over what time line, with what human power sources and at what cost: \n
1-Just as we have voting booths and places in every community in the United States we must do the same for the regeneration effort. We will need in an emergency, power, medical, housing food, water, and energy and ways to move people efficiently. We partially have this in place with F.E.M.A but I would not bet my life on their help, would you? \n
The first scenario is the three to-five day survival period. In a disaster we want people to be self-sufficient and be able to survive for at least three-to five days after an event or in general: \n
-That is every home must have five days of food, non-perishable (remember, we assume no power will be available) \n
-Each home must have or access to five days of clean water \n
-Each home must have access to an emergency medical kit \n
-Each home must have a shortwave radio kit or access to same \n
-Each home must have a fuel generation kit, assuming gasoline supplies will quickly become depleted \n
-Each home must have access to the ability to produce heat or fire \n
-Each home must have a tent for temporary shelter if necessary. \n
-Each home must have seed grains for a vegetable garden (yes, let's think ahead) \n
-Each home must have a 12 volt battery, an auto battery will do and, add two bicycles, and a crowbar and rope. \n
-Each block must have a disaster warden, someone who would get training in the above items and their use; a paid position. \n
Right now some homes have these items, most don't. Some communities have their processes in place, some don't. \n
Shopping list item one for the state and federal government: Have our re-generation work force, (remember these folks?) create 'Survival Support Kits' on every block in America. Kit production will provide jobs; make survivability a real option for Americans not only for natural disasters but other kinds of slow degeneration from economic collapse as well. \n
These kits will be on every block, or within walking distance and supplement those home supplies I have described above. Why all this effort? The worse thing you can have is millions of people in the cities on the move after five days looking for food or trying to escape the chaos of the cities. \n
There are massive issues with this kind of movement. You want folks to hunker down in place and survive for at least five days to ten days until state or federal efforts can be mounted. \n
Hunkering down also makes security for these communities easier, rather than dealing with a scattered population on the move. \n
The details of how you get fuel without gasoline I will spare you but survivalists know them well. \n
How much will this effort cost? Unknown, but my guess is each kit and its mobile container will cost in materials about 750 dollars. Labor costs would be about 500 per kit, transportation, training and placement and after support: about 2,500 dollars per kit for the first year. Let's add contingency costs and the kit total is 5,000 per unit. How many units? Let's say a million units installed in each of five years: 25 billion. \n
Of course there are other costs as well. All we have here is survival days one through five. But what about after the five to ten day period I have postulated. More on that tomorrow. \n
March 2,2010 'Survival' \n
All of the above effort gets us five to ten days of sufficing, mostly in the city. Beyond the ten-day mark there is a lot more to do. Moreover, what I have described above is mostly related to the cities. The country side effort is presumed to be in place from the other efforts described above and will have similar outlines as the city effort except that the Army, state and federal forces will lead that effort. \n
After ten days cities will be out of food and masses of individuals will head toward the country-side to escape what will be an increasingly chaotic and dangerous city environment; people use guns to get what they need, looting, dogs running in packs, sanitation issues erupt right away. Terrible.. \n
These patterns of behavior are not uncommon; we see them in every prolonged disaster or emergency. \n
Most of these ideas work in fire, earthquake, terrorist action, drought, power failure, water issues etc. They are not great for nuclear war. There all bets are off. \n
Now in the country side you have to have in place before the above disasters or slowly degenerating circumstances (the latter is more likely) reception centers to receive the city dwellers. Housing, kits, medical attention, sustainability planning all will have to be done before hand. The kits I speak of have to be along major exit routes and highways out of the urban areas and final destination points have to be marked out before hand to handle millions of people. \n
Food stuffs, water purification, temporary governmental functioning, security issues, communication, transportation and mobility- all issues that this country has not acted upon and may have to. A slow moving degeneration of our financial systems in the easiest to deal with. But think back to October 1929. The collapse of the stock market put millions on the road looking for food and work. Then most people had country cousins who grew food. Today this is not the case today. This can happen again and we have done nothing to anticipate or prepare. \n
What will a truly national or even regional effort look like? We build that infrastructure block by block, city by city, region by region focusing our effort based on what areas, cities or regions have the best sustainability components and spend money in those areas which do not. The have's are put to work creating sustainability for the have-nots. \n
But details and costs loom here. How can this be done in the next twenty years-an arbitrary time period, but one I think is the last window we have to have gotten much of this in place. \n
We create hubs, local and regional until a national network is in place. The jobs it will create will help. The products, all aligned with sustainability and green goals give the country a future in the global economy, and we come out if it stronger militarily and mentally. \n
But as always the question is what comes first, who does it, how much will it cost and how effective will this effort be? \n
March 3,2010 'Survival' \n
The mounting of a national effort encompassing a local, regional and country-wide effort will take twenty years. It will involve a simultaneous re-vamping of the American economy and political structure such that local self-sufficiency to the maximum degree possible is built into the new system. Our issues with infra-structure, energy, power, food etc are all based upon the assumption that the present system will be in place when clearly the present system needs to be totally re-conceptualized. The maxim is that with every complex system at some point there simply isn't enough brain power at the top to manage systems when they reach a certain size, no matter how much technology we throw at it. \n
The dream that we could automate our way to a well run system is a dream. It happens over and over again with empires, cities and even small regions. People run systems best who are close to the production of its basic outlines. \n
What if I were President? What would I do? Well the American people, and others in other countries, do not really believe that life can change from what it currently is. We are paralyzed into complacency, feel powerless to change anything and not sure if we really want to see much change. As one of my students said, 'Will I still be able to still play piano? ' \n
Now the first thing I would do is to shake up the situation with new Federal law that would place in each American home the basic needs I have outlined above for the first line of defense in the event of an emergency in American cities. Each home or block would receive one of the kits I describe at a cost of five hundred per kit. \n
This is the 'wake-up call' approach.Things have to be shaken up. Kick the mule to get his attention. This is a signal that we as Americans are vulnerable to various emergencies and must make preparations. I would bill it as the first steps toward local control and de-centralization, away from centralized banks and financial systems to more local ones, to more local political and social control, to a more self-sufficient country; re-building America from the bottom up and creating new self-sufficiency green and smart jobs. This is true re-organization and cheaper by far than the current centralized system which mostly benefit, life-time politicians, lobbyists and the rich. \n
That is America's future if America is going to survive and compete in the global economy of the future. If this is not done the current situation where the top five percent of the population has control over more wealth that the bottom ninety-five percent will create social unrest of enormous proportions and a re-alignment will occur through the messy method and social unrest, rather than through the ways I am proposing here. Let's hope we all come to our senses. \n
Update June 15,2010 \n
An interesting question here is how do the re-generation principles above match up with an actual emergency, such as the BP oil spill? The above was written before the spill but it provides an example of what is happening and how, if a re-generation plan had been in place, things would be different. \n
First we have a spill, the largest in American history which will contaminate over 1/3 of the Gulf of Mexico, is an environmental disaster, will affect the livelihood of thousands along the coast and inland as well, among some some the poorest states in the Union. Unemployment, damaged tourism, and decay will be with the regions for years. \n
And to boot we are treated to a scene where politicians parade across our tv screens promising relief but delivering none, in it mainly to get their faces on TV and hoping thereby to get re-elected, no FEMA springs into action, and payments have to come from BP and meantime how are people going to feed themselves, and make boat and house payments? A mess. \n
Now under re-generation, first of all, BP would be required to click a computer screen and transfer a few billion dollars directly to local banks who where the individuals involved could draw upon. This would take a few minutes. Right now they are sending checks after a claims process. \n
But we have no local banks. Besides the politicians want credit for relief because that means votes for them. Too quick relief and they become irrelevant. \n
Local banking structures who have the house note and the boat note could and would be in place under regeneration. There is no subsitute for a local person who knows each individual in the community and their needs. If BP didn't transfer the money then the Federal Reserve or the Federal government should or under re-generation would be required to.. It is a down payment on ultimate claims but people in an emergency need money now, not later. Have I mentioned local co-ops. They are even better than local banks but many don't have the electronic transfer techology to handle some tranactions and don't hold the mortgages and boat notes. Credit unions are also good choices, but same problem. We have to build these under re-generation. \n
Second, given what is a slow moving disaster a livelihood for millions has now been destroyed. Where will they find work? Many, as was the case with Katrina will abandon the old jobs and livelihood and we will see decay, boarded up business and migration. Under re-generation a self-sufficient plan would be in place to have those unemployed be employed locally in techno and small town enclaves and available for disaster relief. There would have been a plan B. There is no plan B now in place in the Gulf and there was no plan B; and there is no plan B even being planned for the Hurricane season upcoming. \n
Hurricane season. Boy is there a need for plan B. When the winds arrive what hopes for a return to normalcy might be dashed and millions will be in need or at least on the move. \n
Are we preparing? Nope. The states say we have no money. The Fed says BP is going to pay, BP is going to say hey, the people responsible for rig safety are registered in the Marshall Islands and can't be touched. A court battle will take years and people will be long discouraged or gone and nobody will in the end will take responsibility. \n
The moral of this tale is clear: Communities have to plan for self-sufficiency against man-made and natural disasters. Plan for food, energy, and the labor force to rebuild or sustain what is in place. The large enties, the government, BP etc can't and don't have an interest in helping. It is not profitable for the oil company to give away too much money, and is useful to the politicians only in as much as they can get votes out of it for the next election. After that they move on to the next photo op. \n
We have to think that the self-sufficient frontier societies of 150 years ago have to be wedded to the techo innovations of today to keep this country going and for it to thrive. Be sure to write your congress person. \n
June 20,2010 \n
Now that BP has come up with 20 billion the first interesting point is that it could not deliver the funds directly or quickly to the people who need it. No, they gave the money to the US government. Be prepared for a long wait while the state and local politicians hop a plane to washington to see if they can get their hands on that money and control of it's distribution so as to dole it out to friends, supporters who can help them get re-elected while the people in the gulf deplete their life savings, go into debt, search for other work, prepare for cleanup which might last years, contemplate that 1/3 of the gulf being poisioned, while the marshlands affected by the spill die and make the land areas more vunerable to hurricanes just months away. \n
Things ain't going so swell. \n
So what to do? \n
First get the money out of the US hands to local banks and /or co-ops formed by the communities themselves, composed of the members of that community. (A pipe dream I know) But some people have formed communities and they ought to be encouraged. \n
Secondly, a regional disaster recovery plan ought to be instituted following the steps I have outlined above. (Has anyone heard from FEMA lately?) \n
We ought to be hiring the unemployed and the skilled to go down to institute the plan on a regional basis. First we need to implement the short term emergency plan I outlined about while simultaneouly instituting the long term plans I identified.Note here the the ability of residents in the area to earn a livelihood from the Gulf may be affected for many years. A new plan for the small towns in the area has to be created So what is to be the new self-sustaining model for the area? Obviously the last plan of depending upon the sea and tourism didn't work so well. \n
I like the idea of desalination of the sea, solar power and water power from the Gulf. Make the hurricanes pay from them selves by harnassing the wind to produce electricity. Just a thought. Here would be cheap energy, cheap labor and we could introduce elements of cheap food. \n
Will this happen? Only God knows, but I would not take odds on it. \n<|endoftext|>

And now, when poets are singing \n
Their songs of olden days, \n
And now, when the land is ringing \n
With sweet Centennial lays, \n
My muse goes wandering backward, \n
To the groundwork of all these, \n
To the time when our Pilgrim Fathers \n
Came over the winter seas. \n
The sons of a mighty kingdom, \n
Of a cultured folk were they; \n
Born amidst pomp and splendor, \n
Bred in it day by day. \n
Children of bloom and beauty, \n
Reared under skies serene, \n
Where the daisy and hawthorne blossomed, \n
And the ivy was always green. \n
And yet, for the sake of freedom, \n
For a free religious faith, \n
They turned from home and people, \n
And stood face to face with death. \n
They turned from a tyrant ruler, \n
And stood on the new world's shore, \n
With a waste of waters behind them, \n
And a waste of land before. \n
O, men of a great Republic; \n
Of a land of untold worth; \n
Of a nation that has no equal \n
Upon God's round green earth: \n
I hear you sighing and crying \n
Of the hard, close times at hand; \n
What think you of those old heroes, \n
On the rock 'twixt sea and land? \n
The bells of a million churches \n
Go ringing out to-night, \n
And the glitter of palace windows \n
Fills all the land with light; \n
And there is the home and college, \n
And here is the feast and ball, \n
And the angels of peace and freedom \n
Are hovering over all. \n
They had no church, no college, \n
No banks, no mining stock; \n
They had but the waste before them, \n
The sea, and Plymouth Rock. \n
But there in the night and tempest, \n
With gloom on every hand, \n
They laid the first foundation \n
Of a nation great and grand. \n
There were no weak repinings, \n
No shrinking from what might be, \n
But with their brows to the tempest, \n
And with their backs to the sea, \n
They planned out a noble future, \n
And planted the corner stone \n
Of the grandest, greatest republic, \n
The world has ever known. \n
O women in homes of splendor, \n
O lily-buds frail and fair, \n
With fortunes upon your fingers, \n
And milk-white pearls in your hair: \n
I hear you longing and sighing \n
For some new, fresh delight; \n
But what of those Pilgrim mothers \n
On that December night? \n
I hear you talking of hardships, \n
I hear you moaning of loss; \n
Each has her fancied sorrow, \n
Each bears her self-made cross. \n
But they, they had only their husbands, \n
The rain, the rock, and the sea, \n
Yet, they looked up to God and blessed Him, \n
And were glad because they were free. \n
O grand old Pilgrim heroes, \n
O souls that were tried and true, \n
With all of our proud possessions \n
We are humbled at thought of you: \n
Men of such might and muscle, \n
Women so brave and strong, \n
Whose faith was fixed as the mountain, \n
Through a night so dark and long. \n
We know of your grim, grave errors, \n
As husbands and as wives; \n
Of the rigid bleak ideas \n
That starved your daily lives; \n
Of pent-up, curbed emotions, \n
Of feelings crushed, suppressed, \n
That God with the heart created \n
In every human breast; \n
We know of that little remnant \n
Of British tyranny, \n
When you hunted Quakers and witches, \n
And swumg them from a tree; \n
Yet back to a holy motive, \n
To live in the fear of God, \n
To a purpose, high, exalted, \n
To walk where martyrs trod, \n
We can trace your gravest errors; \n
Your aim was fixed and sure, \n
And e'en if your acts were fanatic, \n
We know your hearts were pure. \n
You lived so near to heaven, \n
You over-reached your trust, \n
And deemed yourselves creators, \n
Forgetting you were but dust. \n
But we with our broader visions, \n
With our wider realm of thought, \n
I often think would be better \n
If we lived as our fathers taught. \n
Their lives seemed bleak and rigid, \n
Narrow, and void of bloom; \n
Our minds have too much freedom, \n
And conscience too much room. \n
They over-reached in duty, \n
They starved their hearts for the right; \n
We live too much in the senses, \n
We bask too long in the light. \n
They proved by their clinging to Him \n
The image of God in man; \n
And we, by our love of license, \n
Strengthen a Darwin's plan. \n
But bigotry reached its limit, \n
And license must have its sway, \n
And both shall result in profit \n
To those of a latter day. \n
With the fetters of slavery broken, \n
And freedom's flag unfurled, \n
Our nation strides onward and upward, \n
And stands the peer of the world. \n
Spires and domes and steeples, \n
Glitter from shore to shore; \n
The waters are white with commerce, \n
The earth is studded with ore; \n
Peace is sitting above us, \n
And Plenty with laden hand, \n
Wedded to sturdy Labor, \n
Goes singing through the land. \n
Then let each child of the nation, \n
Who glories in being free, \n
Remember the Pilgrim Fathers \n
Who stood on the rock by the sea; \n
For there in the rain and tempest \n
Of a night long passed away, \n
They sowed the seeds of a harvest \n
We gather in sheaves to-day. \n<|endoftext|>

Send but a song oversea for us, \n
Heart of their hearts who are free, \n
Heart of their singer, to be for us \n
More than our singing can be; \n
Ours, in the tempest at error, \n
With no light but the twilight of terror; \n
Send us a song oversea! \n
Sweet-smelling of pine-leaves and grasses, \n
And blown as a tree through and through \n
With the winds of the keen mountain-passes, \n
And tender as sun-smitten dew; \n
Sharp-tongued as the winter that shakes \n
The wastes of your limitless lakes, \n
Wide-eyed as the sea-line's blue. \n
O strong-winged soul with prophetic \n
Lips hot with the bloodheats of song, \n
With tremor of heartstrings magnetic, \n
With thoughts as thunders in throng, \n
With consonant ardours of chords \n
That pierce men's souls as with swords \n
And hale them hearing along, \n
Make us too music, to be with us \n
As a word from a world's heart warm, \n
To sail the dark as a sea with us, \n
Full-sailed, outsinging the storm, \n
A song to put fire in our ears \n
Whose burning shall burn up tears, \n
Whose sign bid battle reform; \n
A note in the ranks of a clarion, \n
A word in the wind of cheer, \n
To consume as with lightning the carrion \n
That makes time foul for us here; \n
In the air that our dead things infest \n
A blast of the breath of the west, \n
Till east way as west way is clear. \n
Out of the sun beyond sunset, \n
From the evening whence morning shall be, \n
With the rollers in measureless onset, \n
With the van of the storming sea, \n
With the world-wide wind, with the breath \n
That breaks ships driven upon death, \n
With the passion of all things free, \n
With the sea-steeds footless and frantic, \n
White myriads for death to bestride \n
In the charge of the ruining Atlantic \n
Where deaths by regiments ride, \n
With clouds and clamours of waters, \n
With a long note shriller than slaughter's \n
On the furrowless fields world-wide, \n
With terror, with ardour and wonder, \n
With the soul of the season that wakes \n
When the weight of a whole year's thunder \n
In the tidestream of autumn breaks, \n
Let the flight of the wide-winged word \n
Come over, come in and be heard, \n
Take form and fire for our sakes. \n
For a continent bloodless with travail \n
Here toils and brawls as it can, \n
And the web of it who shall unravel \n
Of all that peer on the plan; \n
Would fain grow men, but they grow not, \n
And fain be free, but they know not \n
One name for freedom and man? \n
One name, not twain for division; \n
One thing, not twain, from the birth; \n
Spirit and substance and vision, \n
Worth more than worship is worth; \n
Unbeheld, unadored, undivined, \n
The cause, the centre, the mind, \n
The secret and sense of the earth. \n
Here as a weakling in irons, \n
Here as a weanling in bands, \n
As a prey that the stake-net environs, \n
Our life that we looked for stands; \n
And the man-child naked and dear, \n
Democracy, turns on us here \n
Eyes trembling with tremulous hands \n
It sees not what season shall bring to it \n
Sweet fruit of its bitter desire; \n
Few voices it hears yet sing to it, \n
Few pulses of hearts reaspire; \n
Foresees not time, nor forehears \n
The noises of imminent years, \n
Earthquake, and thunder, and fire: \n
When crowned and weaponed and curbless \n
It shall walk without helm or shield \n
The bare burnt furrows and herbless \n
Of war's last flame-stricken field, \n
Till godlike, equal with time, \n
It stand in the sun sublime, \n
In the godhead of man revealed. \n
Round your people and over them \n
Light like raiment is drawn, \n
Close as a garment to cover them \n
Wrought not of mail nor of lawn; \n
Here, with hope hardly to wear, \n
Naked nations and bare \n
Swim, sink, strike out for the dawn. \n
Chains are here, and a prison, \n
Kings, and subjects, and shame; \n
If the God upon you be arisen, \n
How should our songs be the same? \n
How, in confusion of change, \n
How shall we sing, in a strange \n
Land, songs praising his name? \n
God is buried and dead to us, \n
Even the spirit of earth, \n
Freedom; so have they said to us, \n
Some with mocking and mirth, \n
Some with heartbreak and tears; \n
And a God without eyes, without ears, \n
Who shall sing of him, dead in the birth? \n
The earth-god Freedom, the lonely \n
Face lightening, the footprint unshod, \n
Not as one man crucified only \n
Nor scourged with but one life's rod; \n
The soul that is substance of nations, \n
Reincarnate with fresh generations; \n
The great god Man, which is God. \n
But in weariest of years and obscurest \n
Doth it live not at heart of all things, \n
The one God and one spirit, a purest \n
Life, fed from unstanchable springs? \n
Within love, within hatred it is, \n
And its seed in the stripe as the kiss, \n
And in slaves is the germ, and in kings. \n
Freedom we call it, for holier \n
Name of the soul's there is none; \n
Surelier it labours if slowlier, \n
Than the metres of star or of sun; \n
Slowlier than life into breath, \n
Surelier than time into death, \n
It moves till its labour be done. \n
Till the motion be done and the measure \n
Circling through season and clime, \n
Slumber and sorrow and pleasure, \n
Vision of virtue and crime; \n
Till consummate with conquering eyes, \n
A soul disembodied, it rise \n
From the body transfigured of time. \n
Till it rise and remain and take station \n
With the stars of the worlds that rejoice; \n
Till the voice of its heart's exultation \n
Be as theirs an invariable voice; \n
By no discord of evil estranged, \n
By no pause, by no breach in it changed, \n
By no clash in the chord of its choice. \n
It is one with the world's generations, \n
With the spirit, the star, and the sod; \n
With the kingless and king-stricken nations, \n
With the cross, and the chain, and the rod; \n
The most high, the most secret, most lonely, \n
The earth-soul Freedom, that only \n
Lives, and that only is God. \n<|endoftext|>

OH mother of a mighty race, \n
Yet lovely in thy youthful grace! \n
The elder dames, thy haughty peers, \n
Admire and hate thy blooming years. \n
With words of shame \n
And taunts of scorn they join thy name. \n
For on thy cheeks the glow is spread \n
That tints thy morning hills with red; \n
Thy step—the wild deer’s rustling feet \n
Within thy woods are not more fleet; \n
Thy hopeful eye \n
Is bright as thine own sunny sky. \n
Ay, let them rail—those haughty ones, \n
While safe thou dwellest with thy sons. \n
They do not know how loved thou art, \n
How many a fond and fearless heart \n
Would rise to throw \n
Its life between thee and the foe. \n
They know not, in their hate and pride, \n
What virtues with thy children bide; \n
How true, how good, thy graceful maids \n
Make bright, like flowers, the valley shades; \n
What generous men \n
Spring, like thine oaks, by hill and glen;— \n
What cordial welcomes greet the guest \n
By thy lone rivers of the West; \n
How faith is kept, and truth revered, \n
And man is loved, and God is feared, \n
In woodland homes, \n
And where the ocean border foams. \n
There ’s freedom at thy gates and rest \n
For Earth’s down-trodden and opprest, \n
A shelter for the hunted head, \n
For the starved laborer toil and bread. \n
Power, at thy bounds, \n
Stops and calls back his baffled hounds. \n
Oh, fair young mother! on thy brow \n
Shall sit a nobler grace than now. \n
Deep in the brightness of the skies \n
The thronging years in glory rise, \n
And, as they fleet, \n
Drop strength and riches at thy feet. \n
Thine eye, with every coming hour, \n
Shall brighten, and thy form shall tower; \n
And when thy sisters, elder born, \n
Would brand thy name with words of scorn, \n
Before thine eye, \n
Upon their lips the taunt shall die. \n<|endoftext|>

historically sleeping. For some call America "The Heaven on Earth." This simply means, "As there are many \n
different ways of dying to go to heaven and so there are many different ways of entering \n
the United States of America. Since there are no differences in heaven between those \n
who died by road accidents and those who died in the Titanic, And so there are no \n
differences in America between their fruits, those with U.S. visas, those in stowaway \n
ships, those jumping over the fence or even bush roads. like heaven or one like America." For some call America "The Land of Dreams." But in their restless sleep with only one \n
hour to sleep and go back to work, their nightmare dreams are "evictions, Insurance \n
Bills, Car notes, Tax bills, a dream no longer at ease - "The Bills." Yet some call America "The Land of Opportunities." Indeed what wonderful \n
opportunities in the K.F.C. restaurants, Roy Rogers, Wendy's, McDonald's, the Great \n
Merrymaids Cleaning Companies. And what a smile the CVS drug store has for selling \n
Bengay Balsam, oops sleeping on a backache the next morning, a smile and everything is \n
fine. As a poet I am reminding their historically sleeping fruits that this land, this beloved \n
country, this portion of God's created earth, "America the Melting Pot Land." America the melting pot land is the only land on Earth folks flung and scattered from all \n
over the world with different backgrounds, colors, races, and languages and melted, and \n
blended, themselves never to be recognized. Although sometimes their zig zag tongues make their fruits ask them - Where are you \n
from? - In this melting pot land "America," only God could save their proud fruits with \n
whom they melted and blended. Thus violence has no color or race in this melting pot \n
land. I counted my blessing as ninth grade school drop out to be melting and blending myself \n

The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat--the deckhand singing on the steamboat deck; \n
The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench--the hatter singing as he stands; \n
The wood-cutter's song--the ploughboy's, on his way in the morning, or at the noon intermission, or at sundown; \n
The delicious singing of the mother--or of the young wife at work--or of the girl sewing or washing--Each singing what belongs to her, and to none else; \n

Anger, an interpretation, of unacceptable behavior. \n
Anger, almost always followed by regret. \n
Anger, an emotion. who's children are, \n
anxiety, fear, frustration, animosity, passion, \n

Be slow to anger \n

God didn't make mankind \n
To hate, hurt and our neighbors begrudge. \n

Go and give it to God, let in Him there reside. \n
His love is sufficient for all you see \n
He lives inside of you and me. \n
To bring mankind hope, joy and love \n
He gives it freely, from His Father God above. \n
It will smoother out any of anger's wrath \n
He will beat it up with the Holiest of bats! \n
He will beat it down, deep into the ground \n
So far, that your anger my friend \n

anger \n
Anger and jealousy are siblings both self destructive in their own way \n
Of the damage they give rise to we hear and read of every day \n
In assaults and murder and every violent sort of crime \n
So many people because of them in prison serving time \n
Anger and jealousy to assertiveness different in every way \n
That only does seem a fair thing to say \n
Those who are assertive speak with a clear mind \n
To outbursts of anger they are not inclined \n
Jealousy and anger out of control \n
Blocks out the light from the windows of the soul \n
Non human friendly that cannot be denied \n
Worse flaws by far than even arrogance and pride \n
To violence and crimes against others they do lead \n
Anger and jealousy are siblings indeed \n<|endoftext|>
anger \n
Don't make a scene, Refrain \n
Angry words march through the brain \n
Mouth clamped shut as not to utter \n
Quivering body, quaking shutter \n
Rushing sound in the ears \n
Eyes blinded, wet hot tears \n
Furious fists, clench and flex \n
Out of control, mind forms the text \n
Pent up, overflowing, ready to implode \n
Rapid fire has them spent, now words reload \n
Body turns to walk away \n
Conscious of the futility to stay \n
The breath sucked in now released \n
Personal Power, tenfold increased \n
Anger tries to take its toll \n
Beaten by control \n<|endoftext|>
anger \n
Anger bestowed upon self \n
Is weight upon soul \n
If you cannot walk with rocks tied onto your feet \n
Why then would you put so much weight onto your soul \n
It hurts inside, and you know it \n
It burns inside, and you feel it \n
But you not listening to your reasoning \n
Nor paying attention to your past \n
Let go, would be easy \n
But you hold on, like its priceless \n
If there is anyone loosing \n
That person would be you \n
Common, enjoy the freedom \n
And see the people smiling \n
If the eye, a window to the soul \n
Then anger, a veil over the eyes \n
Get those rocks off your feet \n
Lift up those veil off your eyes \n
Let your true self reveal \n
The beauty you hold inside \n<|endoftext|>

Anger, my faithful friend, never relenting, embedded in the \n
pit of my soul, ready to strike when fate and foe deal \n
their dreaded blows. Embracing you I have, all of my \n
life, drawing courage and strength in the face of pain. \n
I’ve been shunned by some, chastised by many when you \n
reared your ugly little head, but if not for your defense I \n
would have surely drowned in self defeat. In lack of \n
self responsibilities when inflicting their pain, my \n
foes have said, (Anger managment is what she needs) . \n
I pushed you away my friend, accepting the guilt from \n
others when clinging to you in times of trouble, but \n
as I picked my beat and bloody self up one day I \n
realized it was not my guilt but theirs that I took that \n
pushed you away. \n
Many have said that my friend is bad, but I say that \n
my friend is a gift, so I could stand with courage and defend. \n
For God told of the sorrows in this life and knew \n
you would sustain me till the end. I thank you \n
my faithful Friend. \n<|endoftext|>

Anger is a virus \n
That needs not even air \n
To propagate contagion \n
Whenever it is shared. \n
Anger can't be placed in quarantine \n
To contain its vicious spread \n
For anger feeds upon itself \n
And burns a flaming red. \n
Anger is all consuming \n
Anger does not desist \n
From destroying sensibilites \n
In that haze of its red mist. \n<|endoftext|>
anger \n
Any time I don't understand something \n
Or feel unhappy with the way things are going, \n
Anger steps up, 'use me; let me help' \n
And I used to give Anger a lot of free rein, \n
Till I noticed Anger wasn't all that useful \n
And generally tended to only make things worse. \n
Now I try to rely more on 'Patience' \n
As Patience doesn't keep clicking that counter, \n
Adding up every resentment of the hour. \n
Besides, I can look straight into Patience's face \n
And not have one clue what Patience is thinking of. \n
You know, Anger could learn something from that. \n<|endoftext|>

Laughter and talking, the tick of chopsticks. \n

Thick hung with icicles-its heavy wheels \n
Cumbered with clogging snow, which cracks and peels \n
With its least motion or concussive jar \n
'Gainst hard hid ruts, or hewn trees buried far \n
In the heaped whiteness which awhile conceals \n
The green and pastoral earth. Old Christmas feels,- \n
That well-fed and wine-reeling wassailer,- \n
With all his feasts and fires, feels cold and shivers, \n
And the red runnel of his indolent blood \n
Creeps slow and curdled as a northern flood. \n
And lakes and winter-rills, impetuous rivers \n
And headlong cataracts, are in silence bound, \n

Book One: The Journey Begins \n
(This is a fictional poetic series and short story about events that never take place and about people that have never existed. Any representation of an actual event or person is purely coincidental in nature.) \n
Mission Four: A bullet signed with my name. \n
Mission Four: A bullet signed with my name. \n
Today, my captain gave me another top secret mission plan. \n
For this mission I will be in charge of my own squad on a cold rainy night. \n
The Sergeant Major picked twelve well trained soldiers for me to command. \n
Just like every mission before, we are told to prepare for a serious fight \n
Noisily, the camouflaged helicopter landed beside a serene river bend. \n
Promptly, four of my men quickly disembarked and rushed to secured the hill. \n
In the darkness of the night, I immediately followed encircled by the rest of my men. \n
After we gather in a tight defensive formation, I informed them of who we came to kill. \n
I decided that it was best to separate the twelve men into three different crews. \n
A U. S. Army Ranger has a mixture of dangerous skills needed to take this place apart. \n
We are very well trained and the most effective weapon our country has to use. \n
After finishing the encouraging words I said, ‘It is time for our mission to start.’ \n
Very silently each crew quickly and quietly departed each going a separate way. \n
My covert team carefully took most of our intended targets by surprise. \n
Suddenly, I turned around and killed the first enemy that day. \n
With my nine millimeter pistol, I shot him dead between his eyes. \n
From out of nowhere, sixteen of the enemy soldiers quickly surrounded us. \n
The team scout loudly shouted, “Hey look out! ” right before they came. \n
In return I shouted to my men, ’We will kill them too, if we must.’ \n
Then came a silent twirling bullet signed with my name. \n
Roughly, the twirling hot bullet forcefully tore through the flesh of my arm. \n
I cried out with the sounds of my pain and my team, around me, quickly gathers. \n
I reminded myself that I must fight the pain; for my men I must remain calm. \n
If I do not mine the pain then it will not hurt; this mission is the only thing that matters. \n
Bravely and boldly, in the midst of the battle, we skillfully continued to fight. \n
The untrained and under equipped enemy quickly dies easily one by one. \n
We killed them all to ensure that our squad would safely escape into the night. \n
Finally, the last enemy fell and we waited for the other teams to be done. \n
A bomb that one of the other crews planted inside the enemy’s building suddenly erupt, \n
The building exploded into flames and through the air, pieces of bodies fly everywhere. \n
The team quickly gathered and waited for the camouflaged helicopter to pick us up. \n
Another thrilling battle has been fought and not one U. S. Army Ranger died there. \n

Because the pleasure-bird whistles after the hot wires, \n
Shall the blind horse sing sweeter? \n
Convenient bird and beast lie lodged to suffer \n
The supper and knives of a mood. \n
In the sniffed and poured snow on the tip of the tongue of the year \n
That clouts the spittle like bubbles with broken rooms, \n
An enamoured man alone by the twigs of his eyes, two fires, \n
Camped in the drug-white shower of nerves and food, \n
Savours the lick of the times through a deadly wood of hair \n
In a wind that plucked a goose, \n
Nor ever, as the wild tongue breaks its tombs, \n
Rounds to look at the red, wagged root. \n
Because there stands, one story out of the bum city, \n
That frozen wife whose juices drift like a fixed sea \n
Secretly in statuary, \n
Shall I, struck on the hot and rocking street, \n
Not spin to stare at an old year \n
Toppling and burning in the muddle of towers and galleries \n
Like the mauled pictures of boys? \n
The salt person and blasted place \n
I furnish with the meat of a fable. \n
If the dead starve, their stomachs turn to tumble \n
An upright man in the antipodes \n
Or spray-based and rock-chested sea: \n
Over the past table I repeat this present grace. \n<|endoftext|>

An icy wind whistles past, \n
Another reminder that it’s January, \n
A cold, wintry month, \n
With merciless rain, \n
That batters down on our heads, \n
As if trying to crush us. \n
But you were my summer, \n
Shining like the sun all year round, \n
A warm glow to cuddle up to, \n
A loving friend who stuck by me, \n
Through the good and the bad. \n
From when I was very small, \n
I always told you everything, \n
From the places I’d been, \n
To the things I’d achieved, \n
You were always delighted to hear about it, \n
But things have changed. \n
January is cold now, \n
And each day even colder, \n
Now that you’re gone, \n
There’s a hole, \n
A space where you should be, \n
Like a piece of a jigsaw puzzle, \n
But you’re missing. \n
When I think of you, \n
It makes me cry, \n
But it becomes summer again, \n
Because I can still tell you things, \n
And I know you’ll listen. \n
The hole is not completely empty, \n
Because you’re still there, \n
You’re still with me, \n
And I’ll never forget you, \n
How could I? \n
I love you to pieces, \n
And I always will. \n
It’s summer wherever you are, \n
And the people there will be glad to see you, \n
For you will be their summer too, \n
Just like you were mine. \n

Last night I met my friend and he said \n
“yes it’s been a grey, blue day”. \n
Why is it that when it is grey \n
A blue heart often comes to stay? \n
Today I am hoping for, blue sky. \n
Perhaps the blueness from my heart will fly \n
to join the colour in the sky. \n
And leave my heart with a different hue. \n
One that’s full of joy and true. \n
If only I can remember the colour it was. \n
Vibrant pink or gentle green or raucous red? \n
Or was it just a pure clear canvas \n

Mixed emotions in my head \n
Wanna turn back but I still keep walking \n
Head up in the sky \n

No asking why \n

I have to keep walking, running, escaping...from you \n
You lied \n

Trying so hard to show my pride \n
It's hard with tears in your eyes \n
'Be strong' they say \n
'Don't be weak' \n
People cry not because they are weak \n
It's because they have been strong for too long \n
A new me starting over \n

Black chimney builds into the quiet sky \n
Its curling pile to crumble silently. \n
Far out to westward on the edge of morn, \n
The slender misty city towers up-borne \n
Glimmer faint rose against the pallid blue; \n
And yonder on those northern hills, the hue \n
Of amethyst, hang fleeces dull as horn. \n
And here behind me come the woodmen's sleighs \n
With shouts and clamorous squeakings; might and main \n
Up the steep slope the horses stamp and strain, \n
Urged on by hoarse-tongued drivers—cheeks ablaze, \n
Iced beards and frozen eyelids—team by team, \n
With frost-fringed flanks, and nostrils jetting steam. \n<|endoftext|>

Tainted moments of surreal mid winter. \n
The soft, unbroken vowels of the tide \n

Gulls stutter their syllables of longing. \n
And I reminisce about time spent here \n
In wilder days of youth; when summer was \n
Still green and gold promise and we enjoyed \n
A certain kind of freedom; that is now \n
Lost forever deep within the debris \n
Of these myopic, insubstantial times. \n

It sounds again. So let it be. \n
Let it sound from this night. \n
Let it sound in my hour of death— \n
as gratefulness of eyes and lips \n

our gaze to the far sky. \n
You glare in silence at the wall. \n
Your stocking gapes: no gifts at all. \n
It's clear that you are now too old \n

And bares the forkfull loads away \n
And morn and evening daily throws \n
The little heaps upon the snows \n
The shepherd too in great coat wrapt \n
And straw bands round his stockings lapt \n
Wi plodding dog that sheltering steals \n
To shun the wind behind his heels \n
Takes rough and smooth the winter weather \n
And paces thro the snow together \n
While in the fields the lonly plough \n
Enjoys its frozen sabbath now \n
And horses too pass time away \n
In leisures hungry holiday \n
Rubbing and lunging round the yard \n
Dreaming no doubt of summer sward \n
As near wi idle pace they draw \n
To brouze the upheapd cribs of straw \n
While whining hogs wi hungry roar \n
Crowd around the kitchen door \n
Or when their scanty meal is done \n
Creep in the straw the cold to shun \n
And old hens scratting all the day \n
Seeks curnels chance may throw away \n
Pausing to pick the seed and grain \n
Then dusting up the chaff again \n
While in the barn holes hid from view \n
The cats their patient watch pursue \n
For birds which want in flocks will draw \n
From woods and fields to pick the straw \n
The soodling boy that saunters round \n
The yard on homward dutys bound \n
Now fills the troughs for noisy hogs \n
Oft asking aid from barking dogs \n
That tuggles at each flopping ear \n
Of such as scramble on too near \n
Or circld round wi thirsty stock \n
That for his swinging labours flock \n
At clanking pump his station takes \n
Half hid in mist their breathing makes \n
Or at the pond before the door \n
Which every night leaves frozen oer \n
Wi heavy beetle1 splinters round \n
The glossy ice wi jarring sound \n
While huddling geese as half asleep \n
Doth round the imprisond water creep \n
Silent and sad to wait his aid \n
And soon as ere a hole is made \n
They din his ears wi pleasures cry \n
And hiss at all that ventures nigh \n
Splashing wi jealous joys & vain \n
Their fill ere it be froze again \n
And woodstack climbs at maids desire \n
Throwing down faggots for the fire \n
Where stealing time he often stands \n
To warm his half froze tingling hands \n
The schoolboy still in dithering joys \n
Pastime in leisure hours employs \n
And be the weather as it may \n
Is never at a loss for play \n
Rolling up giant heaps of snow \n
As noontide frets its little thaw \n
Making rude things of various names \n
Snow men or aught their fancy frames \n
Till numbd wi cold they quake away \n
And join at hotter sports to play \n
Kicking wi many a flying bound \n
The football oer the frozen ground \n
Or seeking bright glib ice to play \n
To sailing slide the hours away \n
As smooth and quick as shadows run \n
When clouds in autumn pass the sun \n
Some hurrying rambles eager take \n
To skait upon the meadow lake \n
Scaring the snipe from her retreat \n
From shelving banks unfrozen seat \n
Or running brook where icy spars \n
Which the pale sunlight specks wi stars \n
Shoots crizzling oer the restless tide \n
To many a likness petrified \n
Where fancy often stoops to pore \n
And turns again to wonder more \n
The more hen too wi fear opprest \n
Starts from her reedy shelterd nest \n
Bustling to get from foes away \n
And scarcly flies more fast then they \n
Skaiting along wi curving springs \n
Wi arms spread out like herons wings \n
They race away for pleasures sake \n
A hunters speed along the lake \n
And oft neath trees where ice is thin \n
Meet narrow scapes from breaking in \n
Again the robin waxes tame \n
And ventures pitys crumbs to claim \n
Picking the trifles off the snow \n
Which dames on purpose daily throw \n
And perching on the window sill \n
Where memory recolecting still \n
Knows the last winters broken pane \n
And there he hops and peeps again \n
The clouds of starnels dailey fly \n
Blackening thro the evening sky \n
To whittleseas1 reed wooded mere \n
And ozier holts by rivers near \n
And many a mingld swathy crowd \n
Rook crow and jackdaw noising loud \n
Fly too and fro to dreary fen \n
Dull winters weary flight agen \n
Flopping on heavy wings away \n
As soon as morning wakens grey \n
And when the sun sets round and red \n
Returns to naked woods to bed \n
Wood pigeons too in flocks appear \n
By hunger tamd from timid fear \n
They mid the sheep unstartld steal \n
And share wi them a scanty meal \n
Picking the green leaves want bestows \n
Of turnips sprouting thro the snows \n
The ickles from the cottage eaves \n
Which cold nights freakish labour leaves \n
Fret in the sun a partial thaw \n
Pattring on the pitted snow \n
But soon as ere hes out of sight \n
They eke afresh their tails at night \n
The sun soon creepeth out of sight \n
Behind the woods-and running night \n
Makes haste to shut the days dull eye \n
And grizzles oer the chilly sky \n
Dark deep and thick by day forsook \n
As cottage chimneys sooty nook \n
While maidens fresh as summer roses \n
Joining from the distant closes \n
Haste home wi yokes and swinging pail \n
And thresher too sets by his flail \n
And leaves the mice at peace agen \n
To fill their holes wi stolen grain \n
And owlets glad his toils are oer \n
Swoops by him as he shuts the door \n
The shepherd seeks his cottage warm \n
And tucks his hook beneath his arm \n
And weary in the cold to roam \n
Scenting the track that leadeth home \n
His dog wi swifter pace proceeds \n
And barks to urge his masters speed \n
Then turns and looks him in the face \n
And trotts before Wi mending pace \n
Till out of whistle from the swain \n
He sits him down and barks again \n
Anxious to greet the opend door \n
And meet the cottage fire once more \n
The robin that wi nimble eye \n
Glegs round a danger to espy \n
Now pops from out the opend door \n
From crumbs half left upon the floor \n
Nor wipes his bill on perching chair \n
Nor stays to clean a feather there \n
Scard at the cat that sliveth in \n
A chance from evenings glooms to win \n
To jump on chairs or tables nigh \n
Seeking what plunder may supply \n
The childerns litterd scraps to thieve \n
Or aught that negligence may leave \n
Creeping when huswives cease to watch \n
Or dairey doors are off the latch \n
On cheese or butter to regale \n
Or new milk reeking in .the pale \n
The hedger now in leathern coat \n
From woodland wilds and fields remote \n
After a journey far and slow \n
Knocks from his shoes the caking snow \n
And opes the welcome creaking door \n
Throwing his faggot on the floor \n
And at his listening wifes desire \n
To eke afresh the blazing fire \n
Wi sharp bill cuts the hazel bands \n
Then sets him down to warm his hands \n
And tell in labours happy way \n
His story of the passing day \n
While as the warm blaze cracks and gleams \n
The supper reeks in savoury steams \n

Such a great adventure to achieve the greatest joy unique! \n
Diving deep in the ocean of love, there is no fatigue or \n

Game in life that has no destination but only space journey! \n

Suddenly, he put his walk to a pause \n

BlackPearl swam and got out of the pool as quickly as he could \n

I swim in a swimming pool, this afternoon \n
Of which, one half is in full sun, another one half in shade. \n
I have cut grass and trimmed bushes the whole day. \n
It's a very hot summer day and sweats soaked my clothes \n
Water is very clear and water ripples are so inviting. \n
With open arms, I jump in the pool and swim continuously \n
There is an oak forest behind the pool. \n
Spring season just ended but oak leaves are still dark green. \n
The sun is about one half way on western sky \n
Its golden rays horizontally shine on cloud dogs. \n

Butterflies, Complete panic, \n
A thrill of excitement. \n
Watching the water, pure and clear, \n
A feeling of wanting, drilling through my mind. \n
The race is called, my first event, \n
I feel a shudder run up my spine. \n
Standing in a line with my competitors, \n
My new enemies. \n
I observe them, \n
Watch as they prepare themselves. \n
Standing on the blocks, \n
The eerie silence of the start. \n
I single beep and I'm flying, \n
Straight though the air, \n
And then splash, I'm in the water. \n
The smooth cool water is calming, \n
But now is not the time to be clam. \n
The chlorine sings my skin. \n
I break the surface, \n
Hear my friends cheering. \n
I put my head down and stroke, \n
Only four more laps. \n
The sound of water drills in my brain, \n
I turn my head to breathe, and see my competitor. \n
I gain speed slightly, adding to the tension. \n
I reach the wall and do my fastest turn, \n
I will not let her overtake me. \n
When I breathe I look up to see my team, \n
To see them screaming and cheering. \n
Their support makes me put in a little more effort. \n
Then it starts, that nagging in my lungs, \n
My legs start tiering. \n
I push harder, striving for the finish, \n
Sensing the fear of the girl in the lane next to me, \n
I gain speed. I relish the competition. \n
Ten meters, only 10 more, \n
I start thinking of the finish. \n
It only makes me want it more. \n
I slide into the wall and finish, \n
I watch as the timekeepers discuss my time. \n
As they tell me my time I feel a rush of pride, \n
A personal best. \n
I close my eyes and listen for the results. \n
They call them, from 3rd place to first, \n
Second. A rush of excitement and regret fills my body. \n
But who beat me? \n
I look around, spotting out the winner. \n
She looks so happy, \n
In my mind I think she won't be as glad next time. \n
I slip out of the pool in one smooth movement, \n
Walk back to my team with pride. \n
Receive the sarcastic comments from my friends, \n
And the constructive critocism my coach. \n
The as the adrenalin of the race dies down, \n
I hear my name being called for another race. \n<|endoftext|>

depression \n
Depression hurts when you grow old \n
And life has passed you by \n
No more dreams to think about \n
Or even wishes to come true \n
You lose a friend and then another and \n
There's no past to talk about \n
No laughter, only tears to shed \n
That others cannot see \n
Depression hurts no matter what you try \n
It breaks you down till nothing matters \n
Life doesn't matter either \n
You come or go, who cares \n
No one that really cares too much \n
No friend thats left to tell your troubles to \n
No love that puts its arms around you \n
And holds you close. \n
Why stay and sit in this old chair \n
With nothing to do day after day \n
Smoke cigarettes, why not \n
Its too late now to care \n
Goodbye to this life I would gladly say \n
Why God won't take me now \n
I do not know because he knows I want to go \n
Home with others that I love \n
There's more up there than down here \n
More love from friends in heaven \n
No friends do I count down here \n
Depression hurts, it hurts down deep inside \n
It breaks your heart and destroys your mind \n
Your thoughts are eratic and blown \n
Until the thoughts that used to come \n
Are gone forever, depression hurts \n<|endoftext|>

depression \n
Depression is being lonely in a room full of people \n
Depression is being constantly tired but never able to sleep \n
Depression is longing to be with others yet not being able to cope with company \n
Depression makes you lose your appetite and eat yourself fat \n
Depression is smiling to hide the pain inside \n
Depression is when the soul dies but the body keeps on living \n
Depression is forgetting who you used to be \n
Depression is not knowing if you could survive without it \n
Depression is being sad when nothing is wrong \n
Depression is not caring whether you live or die \n
Depression is having no interest in the things you used to love \n
Depression is lying awake for hours in bed at night contemplating the best way to kill yourself only to realise that you can’t be bothered. \n<|endoftext|>
depression \n
Shackled to depression \n
Intertwined, amongst my veins \n
Self worth, self love \n
Are lost, within the pain \n
Anguish and shattered dreams \n
Lie embedded in my heart \n
A glimpse of personal torture \n
Revealed, within the art \n
A medicated mind \n
Does it offer resolution? \n
Candy coated prescriptions \n
Swallowed, without solution \n
Blind to the rising sun \n
Of opportunity, to thrive \n
Another breath inhaled \n
Without purpose, without drive \n
Shackled to depression \n
Consumed by failure, and disgrace \n
A crying soul unseen \n
I walk invisible, without face \n

They're really very nice pills \n
i take them all the time \n

i say the weather's fine. \n
They're very cost effective \n
about ten bucks a week \n

they're really very cheap. \n
I have to say i'm nervous \n
each time i get a scrip \n
i whisper what i'm buying \n
they often have to read my lips. \n
You see i suffer from depression \n
and i'm scared if people know \n
they think i'm all peculiar \n

You have an empty feeling that comes from within \n
You long to share your feelings but no one will listen \n
You reach out for open arms, but nobody is there \n
Your tears fall to the ground, but nobody cares \n
You pick up the phone, but have no one to call \n
You feel overwhelmed; your mind is a crawl \n
You lay in your bed in the light of the moon \n
Just so you don't see those who aren't there for you \n
The flames spark inside you and heat up your fear \n
Your thoughts are suicidal, your days are so drear \n
Emotional fires burn up in your head \n
Fires of love and pain and regret \n
Consumed in your own darkness, you slowly fade away \n
Your once blue and sunny sky has turned to clouds of gray \n

Depression has taken over me.. \n
Gobbled up my soul.. \n
Will I ever be happy again? .. \n

Why can't it just leave me alone? \n
Why can't it just go away? \n
I just want to be happy again... \n

How can I stop this insanity \n
This truly dark thinking \n
I always end up drinking \n

Darkness consumes \n

My heart askew and my brain out of place \n
I narrowly escape insanity on a daily basis \n
fuzzy clouds of sorrow and regret \n

unable to concentrate on anything but my pulse \n
I will myself to numbness, nothingness \n
in a walking coma, I hear voices but no words \n
I see faces but don’t recognize my reflection. \n
I want to scream but haven’t the energy, \n
so instead I bury myself under my blankets of despair \n
and pray that the world will go away. \n

depression \n
Spinning faster and faster, spiraling down, down, \n
Depression creates a suffocating heaviness \n
which consumes and smothers your entire being. \n
As i recall this space in time, \n
it seems as though viewing an experience that belongs \n
to a stranger. \n
My physical body defeated, \n
so tired there is no movement. \n
Eratic thought patterns that make no sense. \n
Who is controlling these thoughts? \n
My mind is in control, \n
which now belongs to the very dark powerful emotion of \n
Depression. \n
This emotion gathers together, confusion, negativity, loss, \n
misery, self hatred, guilt, and doubt, \n
all joining forces and circling faster, causing dizziness \n
and taking me down to a cold, dark place full of sadness. \n
This sadness so overwhelming it comes crashing, \n
over and over like pounding waves, \n
its too dark to see anything, \n
the next wave crashes over with no time for a breath \n
before the next wave floods tears that fall \n
as though they will never stop falling. \n
Nothing makes any sense - \n
I am lost, it is dark, it is cold, I am scared, \n
in this darkness i fall deeper into this nightmare. \n

depression \n
Depression is running through my head, \n
These thoughts make me think of death, \n
A darkness which blanks my mind, \n
A walk through the graveyard, what can I find? \n
Black shadows walk in between the graves, \n
How many lives have not been saved? \n
Six feet under if not more, \n
How I’d like to go down and explore, \n
The feeling of lying in a box, \n
I can’t get out, is it locked? \n
Is it day or is it night? \n
Are birds singing or have bats taken to flight? \n
I know one day this is where I’ll go, \n
Am I afraid? I don’t think so! \n
Will I be able to explore the feeling of death? \n
After I’ve taken my last breath? \n
Or will I be a shadow in between the graves? \n
Will I know how many lives have not been saved? \n
After this life is there another one? \n
With a different moon and a different sun, \n
I won’t go to hell as I’m already there, \n
A place full of sadness, a place full of despair, \n
So there’s nothing to live for, no future no past, \n
So I might as well end it, end this life at last. \n<|endoftext|>
depression \n
Stab me with your rusty knives \n
I don't care \n
I've given up my quest for acceptance \n
Left my dream of peace \n
Cut me all your evil mind wants \n
I beg you to let me die \n
I want to lie here on the floor \n
Bleed to nothingness in the night \n
Perhaps then my soul will fly \n
Unite with the wind and muggy air \n
Feel the warmth of joy's arms \n
So do what you want to my useless heart \n
Chop me to pieces or burn me alive \n
If death is my only way to salvation \n
Then I want to open the darkened door now. \n<|endoftext|>

Depression is Loving someone with nothing in return, \n

depression \n
I remember as a child I had a deep seeded fear of heights \n
I would envision my demise long prior to even a possible fall \n
Once as a teenage boy I knocked a front tooth from my mouth \n
When I jumped twenty feet into a drainage ditch next to our house \n
My mother rushed me to the dentist with my tooth in milk \n
He soon restored my youthful smile \n
But did little if any at all to replace my fear of falling \n
As I still panicked whenever I even stood close to a ledge.... \n
For the last sixty years I have managed to cope more or less \n
Always waking up before any tragedy occurred \n
But last night upon being led to this cliff in my life \n
I jumped and have not landed yet \n
as I knew it was a bottomless pit I was entering.... \n<|endoftext|>

my life has gone down to hell \n
so now i lie me, down to die \n

my life is not worth living \n
i shall walk into the shadows and leave the sunshine deserted like me \n
you shall not find me amoung the others \n
for i shall be in the dark ally's of confused beings and far away \n
i shall join my fellow destroyed soul's \n
like the man whose feelings were swallowed by the dark black moon \n
this depression has caught me \n
like a cat with a bird in its claws of dispair \n
sometimes i feel like a disease is haunting me inside \n
i feel like a squashed soul-; shattered \n
happiness and joy gone forever \n
my life revolves around pain and sorrow \n
that's all i have to live by \n
my eyes are being deceived \n
the sun has disapeared \n
or did it never exist? \n
darkness summonds me out to do its will \n
never freeing these souls and i \n
soon i shall come out and seek revenge \n
on those who sent me down into depression \n
death so powerful \n
once you have it \n
you can't give it back \n
lost forever in an unknown universe \n

Depression isn't obvious but suicide is. \n
My pain nobody sees. \n
My my mangled body they shall see. \n
My head was all but a mess. \n
Depression overtaking me. \n
Suicide was to be my bid for freedom. \n
Becuase deppression isn't obvious but suicide is. \n
Depression is never obvious even when its staring them in the face. \n
But now suicide will be obvious how can it not? \n
Now my life is too much to bear. \n
Suicide I shall commit. \n
Now its obvious but its all too late. \n<|endoftext|>

God speaks and has much to say. \n
When the snowflakes fall and glisten. \n
God whispers, we must listen. \n
When the earth trembles and opens to swallow. \n
God tells us, there may be no tomorrow. \n
When the sea lifts and the waters tower. \n
God warns all of his great power. \n
When the sounds of thunder are heard. \n
God insists we follow his word. \n
When the funnel winds shatter our existence \n
God gives us tremendous resistence. \n
When we witness the forces of nature. \n
There is no doubt of it’s creator. \n
God reigns in heaven and rules the earth. \n
We shall remain in awe, of his worth. \n

His Power bounded, greater is in might, \n

He could have made an endless sea by this, \n
But then it had not been a sea of bliss. \n
Did waters from the centre to the skies \n
Ascend, 'twould drown whatever else we prize. \n
The ocean bounded in a finite shore, \n
Is better far because it is no more. \n
No use nor glory would in that be seen, \n

Had not the Sun been bounded in its sphere, \n
Did all the world in one fair flame appear, \n

'Twould yield no profit, splendor, nor delight. \n
Its corps confined, and beams extended be \n
Effects of Wisdom in the Deity. \n
One star made infinite would all exclude, \n
An earth made infinite could ne'er be viewed: \n

'Twas at the royal feast for Persia won \n
By Philip's warlike son— \n
Aloft in awful state \n
The godlike hero sate \n
On his imperial throne; \n
His valiant peers were placed around, \n
Their brows with roses and with myrtles bound \n
(So should desert in arms be crowned); \n
The lovely Thais by his side \n
Sate like a blooming eastern bride \n
In flower of youth and beauty's pride:— \n
Happy, happy, happy pair! \n
None but the brave \n
None but the brave \n
None but the brave deserves the fair! \n
Timotheus placed on high \n
Amid the tuneful quire \n
With flying fingers touched the lyre; \n
The trembling notes ascend the sky \n
And heavenly joys inspire. \n
The song began from Jove \n
Who left his blissful seats above— \n
Such is the power of mighty love! \n
A dragon's fiery form belied the god \n
Sublime on radiant spires he rode \n
When he to fair Olympia prest, \n
And while he sought her snowy breast, \n
Then round her slender waist he curled, \n
And stamped an image of himself, a sovereign of the world. \n
- The listening crowd admire the lofty sound! \n
A present deity! they shout around: \n
A present deity! the vaulted roofs rebound! \n
With ravished ears \n
The monarch hears, \n
Assumes the god, \n
Affects to nod, \n
And seems to shake the spheres. \n
The praise of Bacchus then the sweet musician sung, \n
Of Bacchus ever fair and ever young: \n
The jolly god in triumph comes! \n
Sound the trumpets, beat the drums! \n
Flushed with a purple grace \n
He shows his honest face: \n
Now give the hautboys breath; he comes, he comes! \n
Bacchus, ever fair and young, \n
Drinking joys did first ordain; \n
Bacchus' blessings are a treasure, \n
Drinking is the soldier's pleasure: \n
Rich the treasure, \n
Sweet the pleasure, \n
Sweet is pleasure after pain. \n
Soothed with the sound, the king grew vain; \n
Fought all his battles o'er again, \n
And thrice he routed all his foes, and thrice he slew the slain. \n
The master saw the madness rise, \n
His glowing cheeks, his ardent eyes; \n
And while he Heaven and Earth defied \n
Changed his hand and checked his pride. \n
He chose a mournful Muse \n
Soft pity to infuse: \n
He sung Darius great and good, \n
By too severe a fate \n
Fallen, fallen, fallen, fallen, \n
Fallen from his high estate, \n
And weltering in his blood; \n
Deserted, at his utmost need, \n
By those his former bounty fed; \n
On the bare earth exposed he lies \n
With not a friend to close his eyes. \n
- With downcast looks the joyless victor sate, \n
Revolving in his altered soul \n
The various turns of Chance below; \n
And now and then a sigh he stole, \n
And tears began to flow. \n
The mighty master smiled to see \n
That love was in the next degree; \n
'Twas but a kindred-sound to move, \n
For pity melts the mind to love. \n
Softly sweet, in Lydian measures \n
Soon he soothed his soul to pleasures. \n
War, he sung, is toil and trouble, \n
Honour but an empty bubble; \n
Never ending, still beginning, \n
Fighting still, and still destroying; \n
If the world be worth thy winning, \n
Think, O think, it worth enjoying: \n
Lovely Thais sits beside thee, \n
Take the good the gods provide thee! \n
- The many rend the skies with loud applause; \n
So Love was crowned, but Music won the cause. \n
The prince, unable to conceal his pain, \n
Gazed on the fair \n
Who caused his care, \n
And sighed and looked, sighed and looked, \n
Sighed and looked, and sighed again: \n
At length with love and wine at once opprest \n
The vanquished victor sunk upon her breast. \n
Now strike the golden lyre again: \n
A louder yet, and yet a louder strain! \n
Break his bands of sleep asunder \n
And rouse him like a rattling peal of thunder. \n
Hark, hark! the horrid sound \n
Has raised up his head: \n
As awaked from the dead \n
And amazed he stares around. \n
Revenge, revenge, Timotheus cries, \n
See the Furies arisel \n
See the snakes that they rear \n
How they hiss in their hair, \n
And the sparkles that flash from their eyes! \n
Behold a ghastly band, \n
Each a torch in his hand! \n
Those are Grecian ghosts, that in battle were slain \n
And unburied remain \n
Inglorious on the plain: \n
Give the vengeance due \n
To the valiant crew! \n
Behold how they toss their torches on high, \n
How they point to the Persian abodes \n
And glittering temples of their hostile gods. \n
- The princes applaud with a furious joy: \n
And the King seized a flambeau with zeal to destroy; \n
Thais led the way \n
To light him to his prey, \n
And like another Helen, fired another Troy! \n
- Thus, long ago, \n
Ere heaving bellows learned to blow, \n
While organs yet were mute, \n
Timotheus, to his breathing flute \n
And sounding lyre, \n
Could swell the soul to rage, or kindle soft desire. \n
At last divine Cecilia came, \n
Inventress of the vocal frame; \n
The sweet enthusiast from her sacred store \n
Enlarged the former narrow bounds, \n
And added length to solemn sounds, \n
With Nature's mother-wit, and arts unknown before. \n
- Let old Timotheus yield the prize \n
Or both divide the crown; \n
He raised a mortal to the skies; \n
She drew an angel down! \n<|endoftext|>
power \n
To have power over others is something one does not need \n
For tis only by good example that one can ever lead \n
And many with power over others their power they do abuse \n
And for those who abuse others there cannot be an excuse. \n
If you wish to be a leader some sort of form of power you crave \n
And what it takes to be a great leader is to be understanding kind and brave \n
But leaders with such qualities to say the least seem rare \n
To some very ordinary people they do favourably compare. \n
For to have power over others a good person does not desire \n
And many power hungry people are those we should not admire \n
Power over others and personal power are different from night and day \n
We all do need some personal power for to serve survival's way. \n
To have power over others is something one can do without \n
And on those who desire such powers one has to cast some doubt \n
They seem to be control freaks with darkness of the soul \n
The lives of other people they do need to control. \n<|endoftext|>

Jesus is coming to set all straight and you may have no time to wait. \n
For no one knows the day or hour when He’ll return in all His Power. \n
And every eye will see that day when all His power He does display. \n
The power He set aside for me when He chose to die upon that tree. \n
He had the power to save His life but He chose to be our sacrifice. \n
But unlike a sacrifice that lay dead, The Lord my friend rose again. \n
And in the view of many men, back up to Heaven Christ did ascend. \n
As they looked intently in the sky, they may have asked how and why. \n
Then two angels appeared on the way with the following words to say, \n
This same Jesus that did ascend is coming back the same way again. \n
From this you and I should learn we should be looking for His return. \n
To believers Christ sent His Power to teach about that awesome hour, \n
Although Christ died, He rose again, to become the Savior of all men. \n
The power He could have used was a power that He could not lose. \n
Jesus Christ set aside His Majesty, but as God, retained His Deity. \n
He will return in Total Majesty and again, every single eye will see. \n
Many on that day will perish refusing to embrace The Lord we cherish, \n
As Christ destroys the man of sin, with the brightness of His coming. \n
While men who wait in every nation, to them He brings His Salvation. \n
It may be today or tomorrow, so embrace Him now and have no sorrow. \n

To be born of poor parents is their only crime \n

In a Land ravaged by drought and by war men destroyed. \n
'Tis true power can be a corruptible thing \n

Why laud people who have far more than enough \n
When millions are homeless and have to sleep rough. \n
The lust for power seems to be thriving of late \n

'Tis sad to think that many with power abuse it those with power who abuse it weak not strong \n
There is nothing wrong with having power in the first place it is the abuse of it that is all wrong \n
For the abuse of power leads to serious crimes against the powerless though power in good hands it is quite okay \n
And good people with power never do abuse it they use it in the most constructive way \n
Some people with power are quite benign people and philanthropic one of them can say \n
But those who abuse their power to the law may never answer though to karma there's a price they have to pay \n
The abuse of power leads to dictatorial regimes that leads to serious crimes against humanity \n
In the despicable crimes against women and children the wrongs of power gone wrong for all to see \n
The people who abuse their power should never have it though to their power they desperately do cling \n
Power in the right hands an adavantage to others and power in the wrong hands is a dangerous thing \n
There is nothing wrong with power from once 'tis used well but some with power they do abuse their rule \n
And some with power they can become quite nasty and derive pleasure out of being cruel \n
But power in the right hands can be a blessing and kind people with power their praise we ought sing \n
Since they have the gift of empathy within them and happiness to others they do bring. \n<|endoftext|>

the power of God is truly amazing, he never dissapoints us. Even when we think he may have forgotten us, he shows his hand and the glory of his love. \n
I had many family issues in the last few weeks and just couldn't take it anymore so I did what I consider to be the obvious. I gave all my troubles to God and left them in his hands, my daughter did the same. \n
I decided to write a prayer letting Satan know he doesn't scare me and at the end of that prayer when I dotted the last period, I heard someone at the door and there was my long lost son. \n
Earlier in the day, everyone said when they finally see my son again they would hit him, give him a piece of their mind. All I could do when I laid eyes on him was hug him and let him know how much I loved him. \n
After giving my troubles over to the Lord, my daughter and I, everything seemed to immediatlely turn around. I just want to thankyou Jesus. \n

power \n
The little power we have to others we give away \n
They rule our lives for us we go by what they say \n
The media they control and only lies from them we hear \n
They warn of terrorists and terrorism and fill our hearts with fear \n
Of people we do not know or may never even meet \n
They even have us looking out for terrorists as we walk down the street \n
Each stranger that we meet we look on with mistrust \n
Though they may be kind of heart and they may be good and just. \n
They are our enemy yet we see them as a friend \n
For their Political survival on our fears they do depend \n
And those we see as our enemy their leaders are the same \n
They instill in them a fear of us they too play the Political power game. \n
We are ruled by self centred men and us they do deceive \n
When they tell us who to fear them we want to believe \n
They create us and they and to conquer they divide \n
And tell us with a smirk we have God on our side. \n
To lie to cling to power to them is not a sin \n
Some call it propaganda and others call it spin \n
And when our so called enemy civilians die in a bombing raid collateral damage is what they say \n
Is it right that loss of Human life be dismissed in such a way? \n
The little power we have to ourselves we never keep \n
To the power hungry we give it away we value it as cheap \n
They lubricate our fears to insure they cling to power \n
In a garden full of noxious weeds you may not find a flower. \n<|endoftext|>
innocence \n
I don't know when I was born, \n
Maybe when humanity didn't exist. \n
I was lost, in the senses of the insentient beings; \n
Always trying to find something. \n
Then came the humans, and I found my worth. \n
I found my place in the stone man's child \n
And the warmth of the fire made, \n
Since then I am multiplied. \n
I am the newborn's cry and the old man's last grin; \n
The blue of the ocean, red of the fire; \n
Half Bent bough of the golden tree to the ground, \n
Yellow no more, I am coloured brown \n
Once the air smelled of me, and the soil whispered my name; \n
I was serenity, I was beauty; \n
But for years I was harmed \n
And my luster has happened to dim. \n
And then came the bullets \n
With their sharp faces drilling my reality; \n
I felt lonely, for no one remembered me, \n
Puffed with the grey smoke far I went \n
Now I doubt myself, have I ever existed? \n
But when that sudden qualm would arise \n
I would find myself in the smile of a mother \n
With her child, I am still alive… \n<|endoftext|>

As fragile as could be \n
And i don't know somehow, \n
She reminded me of me! \n
In her little eye she saw a dream, \n
Of happiness unmatched \n
But every time she made it true \n
There came a little catch \n
And each time a little tear, \n
Would fall on her knee \n
But again and again she tried \n
For she wanted to succeed. \n
Her innocence was soon broken \n
In light of further days, \n
For every time she tried to smile, \n
Darkness pushed her away. \n
And though she broke entirely, \n
From within \n
Outside, she tried to put a show \n
And tried to mingle in. \n
And she tried to piece together \n
Her unhappy shattered heart, \n
But inside she was tearing \n
Slowly. part by part. \n
I met a little girl \n
As fragile as could be, \n
It's hard to belive, I know \n
That girl was me. \n<|endoftext|>

'Piper, pipe that song again;' \n

Sing thy songs of happy cheer!' \n
So I sung the same again, \n
While he wept with joy to hear. \n
'Piper, sit thee down and write \n
In a book that all may read.' \n
So he vanish'd from my sight; \n

My soul within, which taken up with joy \n
Did seem no outward thing to note, but fly \n
All objects that do feed the eye. \n
While it those very objects did \n
Admire, and prize, and praise, and love, \n
Which in their glory most are hid, \n
Which presence only doth remove. \n
Their constant daily presence I \n
Rejoicing at, did see; \n
And that which takes them from the eye \n
Of others, offer'd them to me. \n
No inward inclination did I feel \n
To avarice or pride: my soul did kneel \n
In admiration all the day. No lust, nor strife, \n
Polluted then my infant life. \n
No fraud nor anger in me mov'd, \n
No malice, jealousy, or spite; \n
All that I saw I truly lov'd. \n
Contentment only and delight \n
Were in my soul. O Heav'n! what bliss \n
Did I enjoy and feel! \n
What powerful delight did this \n
Inspire! for this I daily kneel. \n
Whether it be that nature is so pure, \n
And custom only vicious; or that sure \n
God did by miracle the guilt remove, \n
And make my soul to feel his love \n
So early: or that 'twas one day, \n
Wherein this happiness I found; \n
Whose strength and brightness so do ray, \n
That still it seems me to surround; \n
What ere it is, it is a light \n
So endless unto me \n
That I a world of true delight \n
Did then and to this day do see. \n
That prospect was the gate of Heav'n, that day \n
The ancient light of Eden did convey \n
Into my soul: I was an Adam there \n
A little Adam in a sphere \n
Of joys! O there my ravish'd sense \n
Was entertain'd in Paradise, \n
And had a sight of innocence \n
Which was beyond all bound and price. \n

innocence \n
I am bound and broken, \n
Lying bloody on the floor. \n
No longer with innocence, \n
I'd had before. \n
I'll be forever changed, \n
By just one thrust, \n
A penetration of hatred, \n
To rip away my trust. \n
You abuse my body, \n
My soul and my mind. \n
With one careless shove, \n
You start to grind. \n
As you begin your assault, \n
I close my eyes. \n
Soon it will be over, \n
So sure I want to die. \n
My tears begin to fall \n
With each wince of pain. \n
I wonder why, \n
What have you to gain? \n
As I continue, \n
To push you away, \n
Your pace gets faster. \n
Your eyes turn grey. \n
Slowly you stop, \n
With one final thrust, \n
My heart is torn; \n
I no longer can trust. \n
I feel the hatred \n
Flowing into me. \n
Now so dirty with filth, \n
I seem to be. \n
You wickedly laugh, \n
As you rise from the floor. \n
You wipe yourself on me, \n
Then head for the door. \n
Now here I am \n
Beaten, Broken, and Bound, \n
Lying on the floor, \n
Uttering no sound. \n<|endoftext|>
innocence \n
i grew up to see \n
how cruel world can be \n
first step outside the home \n
oh! it was better in the womb \n
expected people to be \n

but the truth is darker \n
more darker then i see \n
i ran after desires \n
only to get wounded knee \n
people live without a soul \n
no emotions i can see \n
i realise i havent grown yet \n
want to go back to the cocoon i left \n
yet i have to fight \n
to make tomorrow bright \n
sometimes in the fight \n
starving for the light \n
remember you can loose \n
the innocence inside \n
no matter i lose or win \n
innocence keeps me away from sin \n
yes, i'm holding it \n
deep down my skin \n
and the day i die \n
i wish i die with innocence still within.......... \n<|endoftext|>
innocence \n
“I have walked \n
a lot of dark streets \n
all over the world.” \n
“You have got \n
a lot of confidence.” \n
“How can you tell? ” \n
“It is in all \n
your mannerisms.” \n
“I may look a fool \n
but I am not. \n
I may play the fool \n
but I am not.” \n
“I may play the fool \n
but I lost the beauty \n
of youth’s innocence \n
at a younger tender age.” \n
“That is why I treasure \n
innocence so deeply. \n
A great actor disappears \n
in the art of invisibility.” \n
How few observe \n
raw social reality. \n
Truth written in echo lines \n
stage idealized actuality. \n

The snake charmer playing the wooden ' been' instrument \n
And the cobras, \n
Hooded and hissing \n
Dancing, \n
Dancing and swaying to the tunes, \n
To the tunes melodious, \n
Oh, captivated and charmed \n
By the haunting music of the East \n
Swaying beautifully \n
And dangerously, \n
The beastly and brute reptiles of the woods \n
So much so frightening, \n
Dreadful and deadly \n
And venomous \n
And full of fangs. \n
The turbaned charmer, clad in a white dhoti and kurta, \n
Somewhat clumsy and soiled \n
And with the bamboo baskets \n
Hanging by the bamboo, \n
Balanced at endways \n
Through a rope, \n
Approaching to show \n
The spectacle \n
And the folk gathering, \n
Singing a song so submissively \n
And praying to Naga-Devata, \n
Ma Manasha and Ma Shitala, \n
Telling of Bihula and Lakhinder \n
And when with the show to start, \n
He touching the basket, \n
Shaking and half-opening it \n
And the cobras coming out, \n
Creeping out, \n
Standing on, \n
Hooded and hissing \n
And he playing with the hand \n
And the cap of the basket \n
And playing the been, \n
Taking it the head of the cobras, \n
Blackly, brownish and whitish \n
And the cobras listening to \n

Under the spell of the haunting music \n
Of the East, \n
Standing charmed and captivated by, \n
Under the spell of music. \n<|endoftext|>

The deer is humble, lovely as God made her \n

These strange priests enter the cathedral of woods \n
And seven Marys clean their hands to woo her \n

Poised to their points like a leaf's head \n
But the snake strikes, in a velvet arc \n
Of murderous speed—assassin beautiful \n
As mountain water at which a fawn drank \n
Stand there, forever, while poison works \n
While I stand counting the arms of your Cross \n
Thinking that many Christs could hang there, crying. \n<|endoftext|>

Heart beat is rapid and irregular \n
Yet you continue on with more and more; \n
How many trips to the doctor will it take? \n
How many tests on our food and drink? \n
What will it take to make you stop? \n
If you have a conscience-what do you think? \n
Call it whatever you want but its criminal \n
For now we will just call it crack cocaine \n
And WE WILL get the proof that is needed... \n
Even if, this all causes a world of pain; \n

I saw you coming gently \n
with all your slovenliness, \n
silently crawling \n
your fragile body \n
with your icy cold \n
touch of death, \n
and suddenly \n
raising your hood \n
like a desert storm, \n
your waving tongue \n
sprinkled the deadly venom. \n
I saw your eyes glittering, \n
studded like pearls \n
in your hood, \n
then your bite brought \n
great tumult around me, \n
and pain boundless grew, \n
shrouding me with \n
the dark shadows \n

pushed me to the \n
dreaded depths unknown. \n
Death came to a tryst \n
to take me to the threshold, \n

Death stacks life \n
smiling like an angel, \n

I drowned myself \n

A TRUE TALE. \n
'Can such things be and overcome us like a summer cloud, \n
without our special wonder, '-SHAKESPEAR. \n
In a grocery store in Ingersoll our attention was called to a copper-headed \n
snake wriggling in a glass jar. We noticed a peculiarity about its head, but \n
soon found out it was a potato bug, which was afraid of being drowned ; and \n
the only above water being the snake's head and neck, it was fondly clinging \n
thereto. There being 'no jutty-frieze buttress or coigne of vantage, where it \n
could make its pendant bed, elsewhere. \n
Some poets they abroad do roam, \n
But we find themes are near to home ; \n
As we do seldom travel far, \n
This is a song of a glass jar. \n
Snake of species of the copper, \n
And on its head there was live hopper, \n
For we saw that funny sight \n
In a store, it was last night. \n
There in water was a snake, \n
And a bug so wide awake; \n
He was afraid that he would drown \n
So he clomb up on the snake's crown. \n
This snake it is near a foot long, \n
Which doth suffer this great wrong, \n
It thinks the bug wants it to throttle \n
This makes it wriggle in the bottle. \n
But fondly the kind hearted bug, \n
It doth its preserver hug, \n
For the bug when on the water \n
It is only but a squatter. \n
And hath taken up homestead \n
On the top of the snake's head, \n
And on the waters it doth float \n
Safe and happy on this boat. \n<|endoftext|>

And the people academic, \n
Followed by a dull and routinized affair, \n
Monotonous, dreary and dry? \n
Why not to drift far, \n
Deviate and digress differently \n

Full of beauty, mystery and horror? \n

The snakes can often be seen \n

In the name of love, the lord of our hearts, \n
Let me to say you a story, it never hurts \n
Of the galaxy and the solar way, \n
There was a planet that shone in day \n
Its name was "Mars", great and powerful \n
It was a little hard, but prideful \n
There, inside it, with the red stones those just beat \n
There was a Strange and powerful "Snake" that doesn't hit \n
They live with each other day and nights, \n
But they didn't know that they are each other knights \n
Here the story comes: \n
A night, when the sky was calm and stars were down, \n
When the mars was thinking, blinking, at the dawn, \n
He saw a strange, beauty and unbelievable star, \n
That was shining like a diamond exactly in the bar, \n
That star was colorful_ and simple _ though \n
The mars loved it, liked it although \n
Mars just looked at that strange nature, \n
It was strange for him, such a unique creature \n
Such a UN forgetful vision, \n
But it was so painful for him, such a scission \n
Because that star shakes his heart and his lovely feelings, \n
His soul was thirsty for feeding \n
Then, a Love contract between them signed, \n
They will stay with each other to the day of die \n
They were honest in their love, none of them tinker, \n
Because they believe who does it is a Stinker, \n
Of a powerful expression in our life, \n
They believe and so we do, that love will keep us alive. \n<|endoftext|>

Adam is the man \n

Right from Wrong \n
Pleasure from Pain \n
Sorrow from Joy \n
Is this not good after all for Man \n

Let us not put Eve in the picture \n

granting that the myth is true \n
or is it a way of literature telling \n
us \n
Man must not know much \n
He must only obey \n

If i were Adam, i will do the same \n
Less Eve, I shall grab the apple and \n
chew it well, swallow it all \n

That i have committed Sin \n
or that i have pleased God sometimes \n
or that i have too \n
displeased Him. \n

Even without the Snake I know \n
I shall love the taste \n
And happier outside the gates \n

Lots of places to go, Now, \n

enlarges the volume of the Bible \n

He bends and shakes his weak leg \n
While blowing the horny pipe. \n
Then the snake aims at his knee \n
And it transforms into a dance for the onlookers. \n
He never seen an egg since his childhood \n
But he hides an egg everyday for his bread-winner. \n
Though it's venomous they live together in harmony \n
And their living seems to be an exemplary for those who grin angrily at each other for nothing. \n<|endoftext|>

The first snake, \n
Hoar, boar, soar, roar; \n

But running to and fro is all that you know, \n
Because you failed to identify your own fault! \n<|endoftext|>
football \n
Let children play football or basketball. \n
They would experience camaraderie, \n
Team spirit and togetherness. \n
They would learn bearing failures and defeats \n
And abiding by rules and regulation. \n
They would develop reflex action \n
Necessary for spontaneous response. \n
They would develop a steel physique. \n
Let children waste in football or basketball. \n

football \n
After stepping into the field \n
there is no way out \n
even before you start the game \n
you hear the fans shout \n
The players then sings their anthem \n
its football...... \n
the most beautiful game..... \n
And when the whistle blows \n
the crowd starts their roar \n
in the 90 tensed minutes \n
the players got to score \n
Football is friendly only in name \n
because friendliness is not meant for football.... \n
the most beautiful game.... \n
So when the hard tackles go in \n
and injured fellow goes out \n
the crowd becomes furious \n
and starts to shout \n
Even after breaking one's leg \n
there seems to be no shame \n
because its football.... \n
the most beautiful game.... \n<|endoftext|>

I told her that her two teams weren't playing \n
She said those were lies that I was saying, \n
Her ex had told her that the game was on today \n
As so did another friend of hers did say. \n
I showed and I again told her that there was no game \n
Again and again that statement I did truthfully proclaim, \n
But, my words she did not want to believe \n
Which broke my heart and made me sad and grieve. \n
I told her that we could watch another game here \n
She said "NO! " she'll watch with a friend and a beer, \n
So, I drove her to her friends house to watch the event \n
I watched the game alone at my house, while she was absent. \n
I guess in her mind I was the visiting team \n
As in my thoughts and her actions that is truly how it did seem, \n
That was for certain my final and truthful analysis \n
Sadly, the home town advantage was all of his. \n
She stayed at her male friend's house for a couple hours \n
While alone watching the game I wanted that time to be ours, \n
She then admitted to me that her two teams never played \n
So, instead at her friends she got laid. \n

For over 3 years \n
Footballs been my thing \n

Football should be done \n

Football is played with heart \n
There will always be someone better than you \n
It is like life, you can get knocked down but you’re the one to make the decision to get up \n
Everybody gets knocked down but it is your decision to get back up and fight back \n
Spirit is like pride and team is like family \n
Your family at home is there to help you just like your team \n
Big or small winning is the option you just need spirit \n
Emotions are part of the game and make you strive for gold \n
One day will be the last time for you to put on pads \n
I just witnessed seniors putting their pads on for the last time \n
It made me realize great things come to an end \n
Late in the years I know I could go to any of them because they are my second family \n<|endoftext|>
football \n
We were challenged by The Dingoes - they're the pride of Squatter's Gap- \n
To a friendly game of football on the flat by Devil's Trap. \n
And we went along on horses, sworn to triumph in the game, \n
For the honour of Gyp's Diggings, and the glory of the same. \n
And we took the challenge with us. It was beautiful to see, \n
With its lovely curly letters, at its pretty filigree. \n
It was very gently worded, and it made us all feel good, \n
For it breathed the sweetest sentiments of peace and brotherhood. \n
We had Chang, and Trucker Hogan, and the man who licked The Plug, \n
Also Heggarty, and Hoolahan, and Peter Scott, the pug; \n
And we wore our knuckle-dusters, and we took a keg on tap \n
To our friendly game of football with The Dingoes at The Gap. \n
All the fellows came to meet us, and we spoke like brothers dear. \n
They'd a tip-dray full of tucker, and a waggon load of beer, \n
And some lint done up in bundles; so we reckoned there'd be fun \n
Ere our friendly game of football with the Dingo Club was done. \n
Their umpire was a homely man, a stranger to the push, \n
With a sweet, deceitful calmness, and a flavour of the bush. \n
He declared he didn't know the game, but promised on his oath \n
To see fair and square between the teams, or paralyse them both. \n
Then we bounced the ball and started, and for twenty minutes quite \n
We observed a proper courtesy and a heavenly sense of right, \n
But Fitzpatrick tipped McDougal in a handy patch of mud, \n
And the hero rose up, chewing dirt, and famishing for blood. \n
Simple Simonsen, the umpire, sorted out the happy pair, \n
And he found a pitch to suit them, and we left them fighting there; \n
But The Conqueror and Cop-Out met with cries of rage and pain, \n
And wild horses couldn't part those ancient enemies again. \n
So the umpire dragged them from the ruck, and pegged them off a patch, \n
And then gave his best attention to the slugging and the match. \n
You could hardly wish to come across a fairer-minded chap \n
For a friendly game of football than that umpire at The Gap. \n
In a while young Smith, and Henty, and Blue Ben, and Dick, and Blake, \n
Chose their partners from The Dingoes, and went pounding for the cake. \n
Timmy Hogan hit the umpire, and was promptly put to bed \n
'Neath the ammunition waggon, with a bolus on his head. \n
Feeling lonely-like, Magee took on a local star named Bent, \n
And four others started fighting to avoid an argument: \n
So Simonsen postponed the game, for fear some slight mishap \n
Might disturb the pleasant feeling then prevailing at The Gap. \n
Sixty seconds later twenty lively couples held the floor, \n
And the air was full of whiskers, and the grass was tinged with gore, \n
And the umpire kept good order in the interests of peace, \n
Whilst the people, to oblige him, sat severely on the p'lice. \n
Well, we fought the friendly game out, but I couldn't say who won; \n
We were all stretched out on shutters when the glorious day was done; \n
Both the constables had vanished; one was carried off to bunk, \n
And the umpire was exhausted, and the populace was drunk. \n
But we've written out a paper, with good Father Feeley's aid, \n
Breathing brotherly affection; and the challenge is conveyed \n
To the Dingo Club at Squatter's, and another friendly game \n
Will eventuate at this end, on the flat below the claim. \n
We have pressed The Gap to bring their central umpire if they can- \n
Here we honestly admire him as a fair and decent man- \n
And we're building on a pleasant time beside the Phoenix slums, \n
For The Giant feels he's got a call to plug him if he comes. \n<|endoftext|>

Case in point proven. I told you that we the patriots will win the Superbowl of World Peace, but the sell of the Patriots winning the football game ''this year'' was the falsehood. Again I say, ''Selling falsehood doesn't stop truth from happening.'' - Joshua Aaron Guillory \n<|endoftext|>

He screams when they fumble a pass. \n

When we first met we didn't, \n
it wasn't on the menu. \n
Of course it had me curious \n
I gave it much attention. \n
In April we indulged, \n
we were so very proud, \n
bouncing on the sofa \n
we did it in the lounge! \n
Later, in July \n
there was a time, I think \n
when we hit all the high notes \n
a few times by the sink. \n
In Autumn he got lazy \n
all this just had him spent \n
so I baked him pastries \n
and he ate those instead. \n
New Year was so merry \n
we drunk all Daddy's Sherry \n
I think perhaps we did it, \n
I wasn't really with it. \n
Last time was the best \n
and lasted quite a while \n
it was in Central Park \n
We had a bloomin' lark. \n

I've heard that Ballydaly does not have a football team \n
Which puts a cloud on Tommy Tucker's dream \n
That they might win Duhallow for third time \n
And give some bard another chance to rhyme. \n
They won their first Duhallow title more than forty years ago \n
Some time back in the fifties that I know \n
Though of my dates I'm not too very clear \n
I think 'twas fifty seven was the year. \n
When Ballydaly had their first big win \n
And their footballers were celebtated men \n
And John Twomey wrote of Ballydaly Boys \n
And west of Millstreet bonfires lit the skies. \n
The Sullivans, the Buckleys, Jerome and Paddy Ring \n
Of them the famous Mushera bard did sing, \n
Tom Mulcahy and Tim Kiely at the back \n
To Cullen forwards pressure would not crack. \n
Jack Murphy and Con Kelleher were supreme \n
Their goals took fight out of the Cullen team \n
And Pat Joe Kelleher brought his skill to play \n
And Andy Lynch at midfield won the day. \n
Big Jerry Corkery played a true captain's part \n
And sturdy Mick Horgan not lacking in heart \n
And Pat and Eddy Murphy cheered in victory \n
It's nice to recall such a memory. \n
And of them all the Mushera bard did sing \n
And of how Danny Regan called each player a king \n
Such memories I retain from years gone by \n
When I was young a Primary school going boy. \n
But for Ballydaly a near two decades wait \n
Before their fans again would celebrate \n
I think it was in nineteen seventy five \n
When Ballydaly once more came alive. \n
Some of those fellows I remember well \n
They scorned the word defeat and laughed at hell \n
The Twomey brothers Denis, Tim and Dan \n
Could hold their own with any man to man. \n
Con Connors who was a teenager then \n
Years later he mixed it with the best of men \n
I watched him play for Millstreet in the green \n
And for Cork in the red he too was seen. \n
His brother Tim his passing caused much grief \n
He died quite young his life was far too brief \n
He did not even live to see his prime \n
The poor lad was not granted so much time. \n
As his two brothers had done years before \n
The Ballydaly colours Ted Ring wore \n
And Tadgh and Denis Murphy stood the test \n
In the field of play they always gave their best. \n
The Keeffes from Knocknalummin gave their all \n
And the Leary brothers fought for every ball \n
And D Dinneen that marvellous personality \n
How could he ever slip the memory. \n
Denny John Murphy his dad from Lisnaboy \n
A hardy sort he gave it his best try \n
And Frank Hickey could run and run all day \n
And Kanturk's Mullane also lined out to play. \n
Big John Murphy may not have been in that team \n
But on his day the big man was supreme \n
And of Dave, John and Christy Tarrant opponents used to say \n
From toughest challenge they'd not back away. \n
And Dan Joe Casey to his colours true \n
And in his time a handy player too \n
And the Moynihans and the McCarthys John and Joe \n
Too played for Ballydaly years ago. \n
So many players since Con and Bill Jack's day \n
For Ballydaly took the field to play \n
John Regan and the Sullivans Tom and Mick \n
And Humphrey Reardon he was strong and quick. \n
And though as a weight lifter he won all of his fame \n
Big J.J. Fitz another I could name \n
And there were more far too many to recall \n
Who for Ballydaly played gaelic football \n
And it puts a cloud on Tommy Tucker's dream \n
If Ballydaly does not have a football team \n
That they might win Duhallow for third time \n
And give some bard another chance to rhyme. \n<|endoftext|>

Into your houses that stand for nothing—popcorn light \n
That gets blinded on the 4th of July \n
While I steal the lonely bicycle from your garage: \n
And I was your high school teacher for a week \n
While the rain melted the cages of your suburban harpies: \n
And they got up and spied \n
And spied upon the real world like a buffet: \n
And you grew older, tending to know older men from their \n
Various aircraft carriers—maybe even you spied one \n
The you even fancied to love until you decided that you \n
Had to look away and away— \n
Until you midnight happened that very September, while \n
All of your teachers were writing poetry except for the one \n
That never was— \n
And I right to you on this night approaching the first \n
Day of autumn—already the world is old and virtually \n
Defeated—looking for our heroes, I cannot say where \n
They have gone—I only know that they've taken \n
Their time to fend off the everyday monsters just so you \n
Can go to class tomorrow—following the shadows of \n
The football players you pretend to love. \n<|endoftext|>

To be good at football assures one of local fame \n
Though outside of your hometown yours is not a known name \n
For there is quite a difference between good and great \n
And outside of their hometown local heroes few know of to celebrate \n
The difference between local, national and Worldwide is huge one can say \n
And the local heroes as the local heroes do stay \n
Until the local heroes slow beyond their physical prime \n
And eventually the local heroes do lose out to time \n
To be good at football in your hometown \n
Assures you for awhile of local renown \n
But the fame of the local heroes in time fades away \n
And there are young local football heroes in the town today \n
It does not take that much to be a local hero at all \n
Since many become local heroes for being good at football. \n<|endoftext|>

A game called prison ball was enjoyed in France \n
while English boys played rounder in short pants. \n
Town ball was the game that Americans played \n
While friends and family watched from the shade. \n
American baseball became alive \n
With Cartwright's rules of 1845. \n
Civil War soldiers played behind the lines \n
To help pass time and soothe troubled minds. \n
Professional baseball got its start \n
When the National League performed its part. \n
Soon after fans would pay to see the games \n

FOOTBALL \n
The stands are full of eager fans \n
Who say, we're paid too much money! \n
But if they would put our suits on \n
They'd find football isn't funny. \n
Twenty-two men and five referees \n
Chasing a pigskin, air filled ball. \n
Mashing and bashing all the way \n
Till the striped shirts whistle their call. \n
All the generals on the sideline \n
Are waging their athletic war. \n
And the letters in the words they use \n
Never amount to more than four. \n
There's no substitute for winning \n
And no excuse for losing. \n
Though after games; when we can't sleep \n
It's because of all the bruising. \n
BOXERS, PAST & PRESENT \n
The Greek and Roman athletes \n
Wore studs of iron on each hand \n
Beating and clawing each other \n
Like two tigers on the sand. \n
The English called it boxing first \n
To pound someone with your fist. \n
Mostly it was done for money \n
But sometimes by those just pissed. \n
Matches of the bare-knuckle days \n
Lasted fifty rounds or more \n
Till one man's towel would be thrown in \n
As he lay upon the floor. \n
Boxers now use soft leather gloves \n
With their hands wrapped in cotton. \n
Wearing a mouthpiece for teeth and lips \n
They fight like those forgotten. \n
BESIDES LOVE MEN NEED FISHING \n
Besides love men need fishing \n
And for both, most are wishing \n
Catching trophies chosen best \n
To be envied by the rest. \n
Fishing is a game of sport \n
Loved by all, both tall and short. \n
We must fool the fish’s eye \n
If we plan to stir and fry. \n
Some use boats while others wade \n
As they fish the sun or shade. \n
Ice-cold drinks help pass the day \n
While life’s troubles fade away. \n
Most men feel they've everything \n

GOLF \n
Many games were played with a stick and ball \n
As far back as the early days of man \n
Till the 14th century, golfers teed off \n
At St. Andrews, Scotland with clubs in hand. \n
Today men and women both play golf \n
As a group or just one or two. \n
Players, rich, poor, pro, or in between \n
Practice their swing with clubs, old and new. \n
They don't go thirsty cause they bring their own \n
Whatever it takes to enjoy the day. \n
Sometimes they play several games at once \n
As they win money or give it away. \n
There's nothing better than a green golf course \n
With the sweet scent of spring in the air. \n
To escape the drudgery of the workplace \n
Where you can laugh, joke, brag, gamble and swear. \n
PUMPING IRON \n
Except for love, there's nothing beats a good workout \n
Pumping iron with dumbbells or a bench press bar. \n
You're muscles grow tight as you begin to swell \n
And those who like firmness want to know who you are. \n
From 16 to 60 you can still look good \n
Though they'll be some who will point, laugh, and make fun. \n
Pay no attention to whatever they say \n
For the jokes on them, when they're naked in the sun. \n
History's Sampson, the biblical strong man \n
Was blessed with the strength of no other. \n
A modern man who pumps iron and gives it his all \n
Before he knows it, could pass for his brother. \n
So put aside the pop, beer, hotdogs and chips \n
And pump earth's iron for the rest of your life \n
Soon you’ll discover the best of yourself \n
And always have someone for a girlfriend or wife. \n<|endoftext|>

Football is a contact sport; \n
In short—a “rough” game. \n
It may leave you dancing, \n
Or it could leave you lame. \n
Armed with helmets, jerseys \n
And spandex tights— \n
All tough dudes, \n
Ready for the fight. \n
Digging in with spiked shoes, \n
And war paint on their face. \n
Staring down the adversary— \n
No mercy and no grace. \n
Tackles, hits and yard runs. \n
The scoring of “touchdowns, ” \n
With each team striving \n
For the coveted crown. \n
Whether dancing, banged or lame— \n
‘Tis the nature of the game. \n
And that’s okay with football fans, \n
They love it just the same. \n<|endoftext|>

No more, no less, at any time \n
All have stadiums they call their homes. \n
Swift of foot and quick of mind \n
A scoreboard keeps the points and time \n
Score points by one, two, three or six \n
By passes, runs, punts or kicks \n
Winning brings them glory. \n
Most mother's want their son's to play \n
When son's are born their father's start to say \n
Where and when their son will play \n
Parents eagerly await those cherished fall days \n
When Football is in season. \n
Upright goal posts at either end \n
Each team starts with their own direction \n
Weekly successes bring winning seasons \n
Sometimes the coaching can be the reason \n
The final scores tell the stories. \n
When January starts to draw near \n
The Championship games will soon be here \n
Fans are either elated or dismayed \n
To see if their teams get to play \n
and be this year's Gladiators in the Superbowl. \n

football \n
I took my little boy \n
to a nearby football pitch \n
He said he was tired \n
of playing hide and seek \n
He now wanted a football \n
to play around and kick \n
As he clutched my hand \n
I spoke to him \n
and tried to make him understand \n
the eleven rules of football \n
taking into consideration \n
that he was quite small \n
Now rule number one \n
Football is made of eleven strong men \n
When one or two are naughty \n
you may still get away \n
with playing nine or ten \n
Rule number two \n
When a member of your crew \n
hits the ball into the net \n
A goal is scored \n
that I can place a bet \n
For I am very sure \n
Rule number three \n
The maximum number of players \n
you can substitute is three \n
It does not cost a dime \n
It is totally free \n
Rule number four \n
There are rules you must comply with \n
When a team commits an offense \n
named a foul \n
before the game can commence \n
A small advantage has to be given \n
to the otherside \n
Rule number five \n
A freekick \n
is given after a foul \n
Sometimes awarded after \n
unnecessary dives \n
Rule number six \n
When you are shown a card that is yellow \n
Its time for your temper to mellow \n
or you will get the referee quite mad \n
and he will dismiss you with a red card \n
Rule number seven \n
A penality is like heaven \n
It is awarded \n
when a player breaks the rule \n
maybe by using his hand as a tool \n
to play the ball inside the penalty box \n
its time for him to go back to school \n
Rule number eight \n
A thrownin \n
Is when the ball is kicked out of the field \n
It's one of footballs favorite sins \n
Rule number nine \n
Offside is \n
When you are the only one running \n
alone to score a winning goal \n
you must hesitate \n
till you see a single soul \n
Rule number ten \n
A game lasts \n
for ninety minutes \n
You are beat \n
When your team has less goals than the other \n
That is when you must admit defeat \n
Rule number eleven \n
when your team is losing \n
you have to sing something amusing \n
saying \n
All we want is a goal \n
While we are dressed in coloured charcoal \n
Now my little boy \n
I said \n
These are the eleven rules of football \n
lets go and practise inside the sports hall \n

football \n
Bands playing familiar songs. \n
The majorettes with their batons. \n
Cheerleaders wowing the crowds on. \n
And cheering fans—old and young. \n
Illumining the broad field, \n
The lights shine clear and bright; \n
And from the tall, slender poles— \n
They glisten through the night. \n
Teams pitted against each other, \n
Gearing up for the game: \n
An American favorite pastime— \n
Football is the name. \n<|endoftext|>

Sit further, and make room for thine own fame, \n
Where just desert enrolles thy honour'd Name \n
The good Interpreter. Some in this task \n
Take of the Cypress vail, but leave a mask, \n
Changing the Latine, but do more obscure \n
That sence in English which was bright and pure. \n
So of Translators they are Authors grown, \n
For ill Translators make the Book their own. \n
Others do strive with words and forced phrase \n
To add such lustre, and so many rayes, \n
That but to make the Vessel shining, they \n
Much of the precious Metal rub away. \n
He is Translations thief that addeth more, \n
As much as he that taketh from the Store \n
Of the first Author. Here he maketh blots \n
That mends; and added beauties are but spots. \n
Caelia whose English doth more richly flow \n
Then Tagus, purer then dissolved snow, \n
And sweet as are her lips that speak it, she \n
Now learns the tongues of France and Italy; \n
But she is Caelia still: no other grace \n
But her own smiles commend that lovely face; \n
Her native beauty's not Italianated, \n
Nor her chast mind into the French translated: \n
Her thoughts are English, though her sparkling wit \n
With other Language doth them fitly fit. \n
Translators learn of her: but stay I slide \n
Down into Error with the Vulgar tide; \n
Women must not teach here: the Doctor doth \n
Stint them to Cawdles Almond-milk, and Broth. \n
Now I reform, and surely so will all \n
Whose happy Eyes on thy Translation fall, \n
I see the people hastning to thy Book, \n
Liking themselves the worse the more they look, \n
And so disliking, that they nothing see \n
Now worth the liking, but thy Book and thee. \n
And (if I Judgement have) I censure right; \n
For something guides my hand that I must write. \n
You have Translations statutes best fulfil'd. \n
That handling neither sully nor would guild \n<|endoftext|>

Who will forgive me for the things I do? \n
With no special legend of God to refer to, \n
With my calm white pedigree, my yankee kin, \n
I think it would be better to be a Jew. \n
I forgive you for what you did not do. \n
I am impossibly quilty. Unlike you, \n
My Friend, I can not blame my origin \n
With no special legend or God to refer to. \n
They wear The Crucifix as they are meant to do. \n
Why do their little crosses trouble you? \n
The effigies that I have made are genuine, \n

Watching my mother slowly die I knew \n
My first release. I wish some ancient bugaboo \n
Followed me. But my sin is always my sin. \n
With no special legend or God to refer to. \n
Who will forgive me for the things I do? \n
To have your reasonable hurt to belong to \n
Might ease my trouble like liquor or aspirin. \n
I think it would be better to be a Jew. \n
And if I lie, I lie because I love you, \n
Because I am bothered by the things I do, \n
Because your hurt invades my calm white skin: \n
With no special legend or God to refer to, \n
I think it would be better to be a Jew. \n<|endoftext|>

friend \n
I NOW, O friend, whom noiselessly the snows \n
Settle around, and whose small chamber grows \n
Dusk as the sloping window takes its load: \n
The kindly hill, as to complete our hap, \n
Has ta'en us in the shelter of her lap; \n
Well sheltered in our slender grove of trees \n
And ring of walls, we sit between her knees; \n
A disused quarry, paved with rose plots, hung \n
With clematis, the barren womb whence sprung \n
The crow-stepped house itself, that now far seen \n
Stands, like a bather, to the neck in green. \n
A disused quarry, furnished with a seat \n
Sacred to pipes and meditation meet \n
For such a sunny and retired nook. \n
There in the clear, warm mornings many a book \n
Has vied with the fair prospect of the hills \n
That, vale on vale, rough brae on brae, upfills \n
Halfway to the zenith all the vacant sky \n
To keep my loose attention. . . . \n
Horace has sat with me whole mornings through: \n
And Montaigne gossiped, fairly false and true; \n
And chattering Pepys, and a few beside \n
That suit the easy vein, the quiet tide, \n
The calm and certain stay of garden-life, \n
Far sunk from all the thunderous roar of strife. \n
There is about the small secluded place \n
A garnish of old times; a certain grace \n
Of pensive memories lays about the braes: \n
The old chestnuts gossip tales of bygone days. \n
Here, where some wandering preacher, blest Lazil, \n
Perhaps, or Peden, on the middle hill \n
Had made his secret church, in rain or snow, \n
He cheers the chosen residue from woe. \n
All night the doors stood open, come who might, \n
The hounded kebbock mat the mud all night. \n
Nor are there wanting later tales; of how \n
Prince Charlie's Highlanders . . . \n
I have had talents, too. In life's first hour \n
God crowned with benefits my childish head. \n
Flower after flower, I plucked them; flower by flower \n
Cast them behind me, ruined, withered, dead. \n
Full many a shining godhead disappeared. \n
From the bright rank that once adorned her brow \n
The old child's Olympus \n
Gone are the fair old dreams, and one by one, \n
As, one by one, the means to reach them went, \n
As, one by one, the stars in riot and disgrace, \n
I squandered what . . . \n
There shut the door, alas! on many a hope \n
Too many; \n
My face is set to the autumnal slope, \n
Where the loud winds shall . . . \n
There shut the door, alas! on many a hope, \n
And yet some hopes remain that shall decide \n
My rest of years and down the autumnal slope. \n
Gone are the quiet twilight dreams that I \n
Loved, as all men have loved them; gone! \n
I have great dreams, and still they stir my soul on high - \n
Dreams of the knight's stout heart and tempered will. \n
Not in Elysian lands they take their way; \n
Not as of yore across the gay champaign, \n
Towards some dream city, towered . . . \n
and my . . . \n
The path winds forth before me, sweet and plain, \n
Not now; but though beneath a stone-grey sky \n
November's russet woodlands toss and wail, \n
Still the white road goes thro' them, still may I, \n
Strong in new purpose, God, may still prevail. \n
I and my like, improvident sailors! \n
At whose light fall awaking, all my heart \n
Grew populous with gracious, favoured thought, \n
And all night long thereafter, hour by hour, \n
The pageant of dead love before my eyes \n
Went proudly, and old hopes with downcast head \n
Followed like Kings, subdued in Rome's imperial hour, \n
Followed the car; and I . . . \n<|endoftext|>

In measured verse I'll now rehearse \n
The charms of lovely Anna: \n
And, first, her mind is unconfined \n
Like any vast savannah. \n
Ontario's lake may fitly speak \n
Her fancy's ample bound: \n
Its circuit may, on strict survey \n
Five hundred miles be found. \n
Her wit descends on foes and friends \n
Like famed Niagara's fall; \n
And travellers gaze in wild amaze, \n
And listen, one and all. \n
Her judgment sound, thick, black, profound, \n
Like transatlantic groves, \n
Dispenses aid, and friendly shade \n
To all that in it roves. \n
If thus her mind to be defined \n
America exhausts, \n
And all that's grand in that great land \n
In similes it costs -- \n
Oh how can I her person try \n
To image and portray? \n
How paint the face, the form how trace, \n
In which those virtues lay? \n
Another world must be unfurled, \n
Another language known, \n
Ere tongue or sound can publish round \n
Her charms of flesh and bone. \n<|endoftext|>

At the highways of woes \n
a traveller viewed the wind blows, \n

He longed for something unknown \n
that he wouldn't like to see. \n
He's cleaving for something unusual \n
that he wouldn't want to feel. \n

And giv'st our numbers euphony, and weight. \n
Tell'st when a verse springs high, how understood \n
To be, or not born of the Royal blood. \n
What state above, what symmetry below, \n
Lines have, or should have, thou the best canst show. \n
For which (my Charles) it is my pride to be, \n
Not so much known, as to be loved by thee. \n

That flourish through neglect, and soon must send \n
Perfume too sweet upon us and overthrow \n
Our steady senses; how such matters go \n

Yet shall be told no meagre passion here; \n

Nourish them with good thoughts, \n

And their tears the monsoon. \n
They are the hope and future, \n
If they are allowed to bloom. \n
Very lucky we were \n
To have Nehru at the helm, \n
Who had vision for India \n
And a pure love for them. \n
He worked tirelessly \n
To bring cheer in their lives, \n
By quality health care \n
And made education a delight. \n

I ask but one thing of you, only one, \n
That always you will be my dream of you; \n
That never shall I wake to find untrue \n
All this I have believed and rested on, \n
Forever vanished, like a vision gone \n
Out into the night. Alas, how few \n
There are who strike in us a chord we knew \n
Existed, but so seldom heard its tone \n
We tremble at the half-forgotten sound. \n
The world is full of rude awakenings \n
And heaven-born castles shattered to the ground, \n
Yet still our human longing vainly clings \n
To a belief in beauty through all wrongs. \n
O stay your hand, and leave my heart its songs! \n<|endoftext|>
friend \n
Poor, weak and worthless though I am \n
I have a rich almighty friend; \n
Jesus, the Saviour, is His Name; \n
He freely loves, and without end. \n
He ransomed me from hell with blood, \n
And by His pow'r my foes controlled; \n
He found me wand'ring far from God, \n
And brought me to His chosen fold. \n
He cheers my heart, my wants supplies, \n
And says that I shall shortly be, \n
Enthroned with Him above the skies; \n
O what a friend is Christ to me! \n
But ah! I my inmost spirit mourns, \n
And well my eyes with tears may swim, \n
To think of my perverse returns; \n
I've been a faithless friend to him. \n
Often my gracious Friend I grieve, \n
Neglect, distrust, and disobey, \n
And often Satan's lies believe, \n
Sooner than all my Friend can say. \n
He bids me always freely come, \n
And promises whate'er I ask: \n
But I am straitened, cold and dumb, \n
And count my privilege a task. \n
Before the world that hates his course, \n
My treach'rous heart has throbbed with shame; \n
Loth to forego the worlds applause, \n
I hardly dare avow his name. \n
Sure were not I most vile and base, \n
I could not thus my friend requite! \n
And were not he the God of grace, \n
He'd frown and spurn me from his sight. \n<|endoftext|>

Gone, O gentle heart and true, \n
Friend of hopes foregone, \n
Hopes and hopeful days with you \n
Gone? \n
Days of old that shone \n
Saw what none shall see anew, \n
When we gazed thereon. \n
Soul as clear as sunlit dew, \n
Why so soon pass on, \n
Forth from all we loved and knew \n
Gone? \n
II. \n
Friend of many a season fled, \n
What may sorrow send \n
Toward thee now from lips that said \n
'Friend'? \n
Sighs and songs to blend \n
Praise with pain uncomforted \n
Though the praise ascend? \n
Darkness hides no dearer head: \n
Why should darkness end \n
Day so soon, O dear and dead \n
Friend? \n
III. \n
Dear in death, thou hast thy part \n
Yet in life, to cheer \n
Hearts that held thy gentle heart \n
Dear. \n
Time and chance may sear \n
Hope with grief, and death may part \n
Hand from hand's clasp here: \n
Memory, blind with tears that start, \n
Sees through every tear \n
All that made thee, as thou art, \n
Dear. \n
IV. \n
True and tender, single-souled, \n
What should memory do \n
Weeping o'er the trust we hold \n
True? \n
Known and loved of few, \n
But of these, though small their fold, \n
Loved how well were you! \n
Change, that makes of new things old, \n
Leaves one old thing new; \n
Love which promised truth, and told \n
True. \n
V. \n
Kind as heaven, while earth's control \n
Still had leave to bind \n
Thee, thy heart was toward man's whole \n
Kind. \n
Thee no shadows blind \n
Now: the change of hours that roll \n
Leaves thy sleep behind. \n
Love, that hears thy death-bell toll \n
Yet, may call to mind \n
Scarce a soul as thy sweet soul \n
Kind. \n
VI. \n
How should life, O friend, forget \n
Death, whose guest art thou? \n
Faith responds to love's regret, \n
How? \n
Still, for us that bow \n
Sorrowing, still, though life be set, \n
Shines thy bright mild brow. \n
Yea, though death and thou be met, \n
Love may find thee now \n
Still, albeit we know not yet \n
How. \n
VII. \n
Past as music fades, that shone \n
While its life might last; \n
As a song-bird's shadow flown \n
Past! \n
Death's reverberate blast \n
Now for music's lord has blown \n
Whom thy love held fast. \n
Dead thy king, and void his throne: \n
Yet for grief at last \n
Love makes music of his own \n
Past. \n<|endoftext|>
rainbow \n
Triumphal arch, that fill'st the sky \n
When storms prepare to part, \n

To teach me what thou art; - \n
Still seem; as to my childhood's sight, \n
A midway station given \n
For happy spirits to alight \n
Betwixt the earth and heaven. \n
Can all that Optics teach unfold \n
Thy form to please me so, \n
As when I dreamt of gems and gold \n
Hid in thy radiant bow? \n
When Science from Creation's face \n
Enchantment's veil withdraws, \n
What lovely visions yield their place \n
To cold material laws! \n
And yet, fair bow, no fabling dreams, \n
But words of the Most High, \n
Have told why first thy robe of beams \n
Was woven in the sky. \n
When o'er the green, undeluged earth \n
Heaven's covenant thou didst shine, \n
How came the world's gray fathers forth \n
To watch thy sacred sign! \n
And when its yellow luster smiled \n
O'er mountains yet untrod, \n
Each mother held aloft her child \n
To bless the bow of God. \n
Methinks, thy jubilee to keep, \n
The first-made anthem rang \n
On earth, delivered from the deep, \n
And the first poet sang. \n
Nor ever shall the Muse's eye \n
Unraptured greet thy beam; \n
Theme of primeval prophecy, \n
Be still the prophet's theme! \n
The earth to thee her incense yields, \n
The lark thy welcome sings, \n
When, glittering in the freshened fields, \n
The snowy mushroom springs. \n
How glorious is thy girdle, cast \n
O'er mountain, tower, and town, \n
Or mirrored in the ocean vast, \n
A thousand fathoms down! \n
As fresh in yon horizon dark, \n
As young thy beauties seem, \n
As when the eagle from the ark \n
First sported in thy beam: \n
For, faithful to its sacred page, \n
Heaven still rebuilds thy span; \n
Nor lets the type grow pale with age, \n
That first spoke peace to man. \n<|endoftext|>

In the private quarters \n
Of many slowly healing \n
Shattered hearts \n
Like the roar of a tempest \n

The evil spewing crashes \n
That tore down the proud symbol \n
Of American Success last autumn; \n
A dolorous cry restrained \n
But reveberates in a spasm \n
Of agony made worse in \n
The dead of night by \n
The poignant memories of \n
Loved ones' sudden demise, \n
A loss that only relentless \n
Prayers could help mend. \n
Far away, a Noah-styled rainbow \n
Crowns the sky; a heaven's \n
Promise to end pain and drain? \n
In earnest, we all pray \n
For a better tomorrow; \n
A world free from misunderstandigs, \n
Religious bigotry, riots, \n
Hypocritism, racism \n
And ruinous power struggles. \n

Really gained from these? \n<|endoftext|>

Death when conquered by the dream \n
As you slowly melted to mingle into the waves \n
I keep on benign look to the mist when reflexed \n

by your reminiscence from the truth \n
as day when dies bereft of sun by the shadow \n
night when cries out for the moon when alone \n
yet deep dark night turns to the light \n
the scar unflappable when sparks in me \n
the outcry besotted may diffuse my quest \n
the mute flow of the silence touches you nearer \n

At the end of the rainbow in fable 'tis told \n
The Leprechaun he hides his bronze pot of gold \n
And if you should catch him hold on to him tight \n

If he escapes from you him you may never see again \n
Whilst firmly in your grasp your eyes on him must remain \n
Until his hidden fortune to you he will show \n
Hold on to him tightly do not leave him go, \n
He will say I will show you where my gold is hidden if you first set me free \n
But if you do that out of sight he will flee \n
Then his pot of gold on your own you won't find \n

Watch the white dawn gleam, \n
To the thunder of hidden guns. \n
I hear the hot shells scream \n
Through skies as sweet as a dream \n
Where the silver dawn-break runs. \n
And stabbing of light \n

But I feel in my being the old, high, sanctified thrill, \n
And I thank the gods that the dawn is beautiful still. \n
From death that hurtles by \n
I crouch in the trench day-long, \n
But up to a cloudless sky \n
From the ground where our dead men lie \n
A brown lark soars in song. \n
Through the tortured air, \n
Rent by the shrapnel's flare, \n
Over the troubleless dead he carols his fill, \n
And I thank the gods that the birds are beautiful still. \n
Where the parapet is low \n
And level with the eye \n
Poppies and cornflowers glow \n
And the corn sways to and fro \n
In a pattern against the sky. \n
The gold stalks hide \n
Bodies of men who died \n
Charging at dawn through the dew to be killed or to kill. \n
I thank the gods that the flowers are beautiful still. \n
When night falls dark we creep \n
In silence to our dead. \n
We dig a few feet deep \n
And leave them there to sleep - \n
But blood at night is red, \n
Yea, even at night, \n
And a dead man's face is white. \n
And I dry my hands, that are also trained to kill, \n
And I look at the stars - for the stars are beautiful still. \n<|endoftext|>

Genesis ix. 13. \n
SOFT falls the mild, reviving shower \n
From April's changeful skies, \n
And rain-drops bend each trembling flower \n
They tinge with richer dyes. \n
Soon shall their genial influence call \n
A thousand buds to day, \n
Which, waiting but their balmy fall, \n
In hidden beauty lay. \n
E'en now full many a blossom's bell \n
With fragrance fills the shade; \n
And verdure clothes each grassy dell, \n
In brighter tints arrayed. \n

From heaven to earth is bowed? \n
Haste, ere it vanish, haste to view \n
The Rainbow in the cloud. \n
How bright its glory! there behold \n

The topaz blends its hue of gold \n
With the deep ruby's blaze. \n
Yet not alone to charm thy sight \n
Was given the vision fair;? \n
Gaze on that arch of colored light, \n
And read God's mercy there. \n
It tells us that the mighty deep, \n
Fast by th' Eternal chained, \n
No more o'er earth's domains shall sweep, \n
Awful and unrestrained. \n
It tells that seasons, heat and cold, \n
Fixed by his sovereign will, \n
Shall, in their course, bid man behold \n
Seed-time and harvest still; \n
That still the flower shall deck the field, \n
When vernal zephyrs blow; \n
That still the vine its fruit will yield, \n
When autumn sun-beams glow. \n
Then, child of that fair earth! which yet \n
Smiles with each charm endowed, \n
Bless thou His name, whose mercy set \n

Thine emulous fond flowers are dead, too, \n
And the daft sun-assaulter, he \n
That frighted thee so oft, is fled or dead: \n
Save only me \n
(Nor is it sad to thee!) \n
Save only me \n
There is none left to mourn thee in the fields. \n
The gray grass is not dappled with the snow; \n
Its two banks have not shut upon the river; \n
But it is long ago- \n
It seems forever- \n
Since first I saw thee glance, \n
With all the dazzling other ones, \n
In airy dalliance, \n
Precipitate in love, \n
Tossed, tangled, whirled and whirled above, \n
Like a limp rose-wreath in a fairy dance. \n
When that was, the soft mist \n
Of my regret hung not on all the land, \n
And I was glad for thee, \n
And glad for me, I wist. \n
Thou didst not know, who tottered, wandering on high, \n
That fate had made thee for the pleasure of the wind, \n
With those great careless wings, \n
Nor yet did I. \n
And there were other things: \n
It seemed God let thee flutter from his gentle clasp: \n
Then fearful he had let thee win \n
Too far beyond him to be gathered in, \n
Snatched thee, o'er eager, with ungentle grasp. \n
Ah! I remember me \n
How once conspiracy was rife \n
Against my life- \n
The languor of it and the dreaming fond; \n
Surging, the grasses dizzied me of thought, \n
The breeze three odors brought, \n
And a gem-flower waved in a wand! \n
Then when I was distraught \n
And could not speak, \n
Sidelong, full on my cheek, \n
What should that reckless zephyr fling \n
But the wild touch of thy dye-dusty wing! \n
I found that wing broken to-day! \n
For thou are dead, I said, \n
And the strange birds say. \n
I found it with the withered leaves \n

Once you touch a butterfly \n
it often, flustered, fails to flutter, \n
and cannot soar into the sky \n
without a sputter and may splutter, \n
because for butterflies the touch \n
of humans, friend or enemy, \n
can be calamitous, the clutch \n
of humankind’s hegemony. \n
When touching those whom we befriend, \n
no less than those whom we betroth, \n
we must take care lest we offend, \n
for, whether butterfly or moth, \n
the ones for whom we care may find \n
it hard to soar if we should brush \n
the dust, though trying to be kind, \n
from wings that, having touched, we crush. \n

butterfly \n
Some time ago, \n
while on my run \n
I came to the old weir. \n
And, as I passed \n
a butterfly \n
flew up to greet me here. \n
She went around in circles then \n
and looked me over well, \n
I thought perhaps she just liked men, \n
that's when I almost fell. \n
I'd kept my eyes on her too much \n
and didn't see the rock of ages. \n
And so my bare foot's painful touch \n
now caused the mother of all rages. \n
But she stayed with me for a mile, \n
then daintily said her goodbye. \n
And I enjoyed her all the while: \n
She was a pretty butterfly. \n
One hundred days I met her daily, \n
each morning she seemed more delicious. \n
She'd always look a bit capricious \n
but fluttered happily and gaily. \n
One day she didn't keep our date, \n
at first I didn't worry. \n
Quite simply she just could be late \n

Love is like a butterfly \n
never here nor there \n
high or low \n
not really watching where to go. \n
A first love is like a butterfly \n
hatching out of a cocoon \n
we are amazed by the beauty \n
of this new feeling. \n
True love is like a butterfly \n
spreading its wings \n
and starting towards the sky \n
knowing that they want to have this forever. \n
Loosing love is like a butterfly \n
laying its eggs then flying away to die \n
leaving them in this big world all alone \n
knowing nothing familiar only home. \n
Wanting for love is like a butterfly \n
still as a caterpillar \n
wanting those wings \n
to be just like his friends. \n
Love is like a butterfly \n
Trying to spread its wing and fly \n
Love is like a butterfly \n
It can stay or it can die. \n

butterfly \n
A butterfly can fly away, \n
A butterfly can be a kiss, \n
A butterfly can be such a gaze, \n
A butterfly can die just like that. \n
That's what happened to you. \n
God took you, \n
Turned you into a butterfly, \n
And you flew away. \n

There’s one thing I know, \n
That I hold close to me \n
My dreams are drifting \n
Off and onto the sea \n
I stand at the shore \n
The cool wind in my hair \n
And I remember one spring \n
You were here then \n
I felt your butterfly kisses \n
Shining over me \n
My butterfly kisses mean so much to me \n
I promise that I \n
Shall never let go. \n
My butterfly kisses \n
I love you so. \n
The waves crash on the rocks \n
The white twirling waves \n
You hold me so close \n
So I never stray \n
So close to the edge, \n
And I hold on tight \n
Knowing you’re my anchor \n
My anchor \n
On this cold spring night \n
I felt your butterfly kisses \n
Shining over me \n
My butterfly kisses mean so much to me \n
I promise that I \n
Shall never let go. \n
My butterfly kisses \n
I love you so. \n
Oh my butterfly kisses \n
On the cold stormy nights \n
Oh my butterfly kisses \n
Feel like home \n
You’re butterfly kisses \n
Warm me to the core \n
And our butterfly kisses will last \n
On and on \n
No matter if the world may stop \n
No matter if I’m in L.A or \n
Somewhere you can’t reach me \n
Remember, my darling \n
I will always love your \n
Butterfly kisses \n<|endoftext|>

STAY near me---do not take thy flight! \n
A little longer stay in sight! \n
Much converse do I find I thee, \n
Historian of my infancy ! \n
Float near me; do not yet depart! \n
Dead times revive in thee: \n
Thou bring'st, gay creature as thou art! \n
A solemn image to my heart, \n
My father's family! \n
Oh! pleasant, pleasant were the days, \n
The time, when, in our childish plays, \n
My sister Emmeline and I \n
Together chased the butterfly! \n
A very hunter did I rush \n
Upon the prey:---with leaps and spring \n
I followed on from brake to bush; \n
But she, God love her, feared to brush \n
The dust from off its wings. \n<|endoftext|>

I saw a butterfly today \n
Small and green with no wings \n
Crawlsing into shadows\hiding from a world who ignores it's subtle beauty \n
Afraid to never be noticed...appreciated \n
I saw a butterfly today \n
Camoflauged and shielded in self-made walls \n
Neglecting the world of it's gentle touch \n
Afraid to be met with a forceful hand \n
I saw a butterfly today \n
Wings new and fresh \n
Excited with exhileration \n
Facing a world with new courage \n
Knowing it can not be harmed \n
I saw a butterfly today \n
Blue and gold streaked the sky \n
embracing the sunlight's rays \n
Fluttering around my head \n
Carring my heart on her flight \n

Long, long ago, \n
There was a tale of a blue butterfly, \n
That live in a silvery cage, \n
Up at the cold attic, \n
Silhouetted against the wall, \n
Surrounded by eerie silent, \n
Lost in the unknown time. \n
It flapped its wings hopelessly, \n
Around the dusty cage, \n
Its magnificent colour getting paler and fader, \n
Under the screened window, \n
And its spirit slipped away, \n
Inch by inch into the thin air. \n
But I do not know, \n
The ending of this tale, \n
And only the blue butterfly, \n
And HE who know it to the very end. \n<|endoftext|>
butterfly \n
In the middle of our porridge plates \n
There was a blue butterfly painted \n
And each morning we tried who should reach the \n
butterfly first. \n
Then the Grandmother said: "Do not eat the poor \n
butterfly." \n
That made us laugh. \n
Always she said it and always it started us laughing. \n
It seemed such a sweet little joke. \n
I was certain that one fine morning \n
The butterfly would fly out of our plates, \n
Laughing the teeniest laugh in the world, \n
And perch on the Grandmother's lap. \n<|endoftext|>

Sitting on an isolated bench \n

In jasmine bloom, and privet, of white wings, \n
That go and come, and fly, and peep and hide, \n
With muffled music, murmured far and wide. \n
Ah, the Spring time, when we think of all the lays \n
That dreamy lovers send to dreamy mays, \n
Of the fond hearts within a billet bound, \n
Of all the soft silk paper that pens wound, \n
The messages of love that mortals write \n
Filled with intoxication of delight, \n
Written in April and before the May time \n
Shredded and flown, playthings for the wind's playtime, \n
We dream that all white butterflies above, \n
Who seek through clouds or waters souls to love, \n
And leave their lady mistress in despair, \n
To flit to flowers, as kinder and more fair, \n
Are but torn love-letters, that through the skies \n
Flutter, and float, and change to butterflies \n<|endoftext|>

Lord, thou hast given me a cell, \n
Wherein to dwell; \n
A little house, whose humble roof \n
Is weather proof; \n
Under the spars of which I lie \n
Both soft and dry; \n
Where thou, my chamber for to ward, \n
Hast set a guard \n
Of harmless thoughts, to watch and keep \n
Me, while I sleep. \n
Low is my porch, as is my fate; \n
Both void of state; \n
And yet the threshold of my door \n
Is worn by th' poor, \n
Who thither come, and freely get \n
Good words, or meat. \n
Like as my parlour, so my hall \n
And kitchen's small; \n
A little buttery, and therein \n
A little bin, \n
Which keeps my little loaf of bread \n
Unchipt, unflead; \n
Some brittle sticks of thorn or briar \n
Make me a fire, \n
Close by whose living coal I sit, \n
And glow like it. \n
Lord, I confess too, when I dine, \n
The pulse is thine, \n
And all those other bits that be \n
There placed by thee; \n
The worts, the purslain, and the mess \n
Of water-cress, \n
Which of thy kindness thou hast sent; \n
And my content \n
Makes those, and my beloved beet, \n
To be more sweet. \n
'Tis thou that crown'st my glittering hearth \n
With guiltless mirth, \n
And giv'st me wassail bowls to drink, \n
Spiced to the brink. \n
Lord, 'tis thy plenty-dropping hand \n
That soils my land, \n
And giv'st me, for my bushel sown, \n
Twice ten for one; \n
Thou mak'st my teeming hen to lay \n
Her egg each day; \n
Besides, my healthful ewes to bear \n
Me twins each year; \n
The while the conduits of my kine \n
Run cream, for wine: \n
All these, and better, thou dost send \n
Me, to this end,-- \n
That I should render, for my part, \n
A thankful heart; \n
Which, fired with incense, I resign, \n
As wholly thine; \n
--But the acceptance, that must be, \n
My Christ, by Thee. \n<|endoftext|>
god \n
I \n
Thou who hast made thy dwelling fair \n
With flowers beneath, above with starry lights, \n
And set thine altars everywhere,-- \n
On mountain heights, \n
In woodlands dim with many a dream, \n
In valleys bright with springs, \n
And on the curving capes of every stream: \n
Thou who hast taken to thyself the wings \n
Of morning, to abide \n
Upon the secret places of the sea, \n
And on far islands, where the tide \n
Visits the beauty of untrodden shores, \n
Waiting for worshippers to come to thee \n
In thy great out-of-doors! \n
To thee I turn, to thee I make my prayer, \n
God of the open air. \n
II \n
Seeking for thee, the heart of man \n
Lonely and longing ran, \n
In that first, solitary hour, \n
When the mysterious power \n
To know and love the wonder of the morn \n
Was breathed within him, and his soul was born; \n
And thou didst meet thy child, \n
Not in some hidden shrine, \n
But in the freedom of the garden wild, \n
And take his hand in thine,-- \n
There all day long in Paradise he walked, \n
And in the cool of evening with thee talked. \n
III \n
Lost, long ago, that garden bright and pure, \n
Lost, that calm day too perfect to endure, \n
And lost the childlike love that worshipped and was sure! \n
For men have dulled their eyes with sin, \n
And dimmed the light of heaven with doubt, \n
And built their temple walls to shut thee in, \n
And framed their iron creeds to shut thee out. \n
But not for thee the closing of the door, \n
O Spirit unconfined! \n
Thy ways are free \n
As is the wandering wind, \n
And thou hast wooed thy children, to restore \n
Their fellowship with thee, \n
In peace of soul and simpleness of mind. \n
IV \n
Joyful the heart that, when the flood rolled by, \n
Leaped up to see the rainbow in the sky; \n
And glad the pilgrim, in the lonely night, \n
For whom the hills of Haran, tier on tier, \n
Built up a secret stairway to the height \n
Where stars like angel eyes were shining clear. \n
From mountain-peaks, in many a land and age, \n
Disciples of the Persian seer \n
Have hailed the rising sun and worshipped thee; \n
And wayworn followers of the Indian sage \n
Have found the peace of God beneath a spreading tree. \n
But One, but One,--ah, child most dear, \n
And perfect image of the Love Unseen,-- \n
Walked every day in pastures green, \n
And all his life the quiet waters by, \n
Reading their beauty with a tranquil eye. \n
To him the desert was a place prepared \n
For weary hearts to rest; \n
The hillside was a temple blest; \n
The grassy vale a banquet-room \n
Where he could feed and comfort many a guest. \n
With him the lily shared \n
The vital joy that breathes itself in bloom; \n
And every bird that sang beside the nest \n
Told of the love that broods o'er every living thing. \n
He watched the shepherd bring \n
His flock at sundown to the welcome fold, \n
The fisherman at daybreak fling \n
His net across the waters gray and cold, \n
And all day long the patient reaper swing \n
His curving sickle through the harvest-gold. \n
So through the world the foot-path way he trod, \n
Drawing the air of heaven in every breath; \n
And in the evening sacrifice of death \n
Beneath the open sky he gave his soul to God. \n
Him will I trust, and for my Master take; \n
Him will I follow; and for his dear sake, \n
God of the open air, \n
To thee I make my prayer. \n
V \n
>From the prison of anxious thought that greed has builded, \n
>From the fetters that envy has wrought and pride has gilded, \n
>From the noise of the crowded ways and the fierce confusion, \n
>From the folly that wastes its days in a world of illusion, \n
(Ah, but the life is lost that frets and languishes there!) \n
I would escape and be free in the joy of the open air. \n
By the breadth of the blue that shines in silence o'er me, \n
By the length of the mountain-lines that stretch before me, \n
By the height of the cloud that sails, with rest in motion, \n
Over the plains and the vales to the measureless ocean, \n
(Oh, how the sight of the things that are great enlarges the eyes!) \n
Lead me out of the narrow life, to the peace of the hills \n
and the skies. \n
While the tremulous leafy haze on the woodland is spreading, \n
And the bloom on the meadow betrays where May has been treading; \n
While the birds on the branches above, and the brooks flowing under, \n
Are singing together of love in a world full of wonder, \n
(Lo, in the marvel of Springtime, dreams are changed into truth!) \n
Quicken my heart, and restore the beautiful hopes of youth. \n
By the faith that the flowers show when they bloom unbidden, \n
By the calm of the river's flow to a goal that is hidden, \n
By the trust of the tree that clings to its deep foundation, \n
By the courage of wild birds' wings on the long migration, \n
(Wonderful secret of peace that abides in Nature's breast!) \n
Teach me how to confide, and live my life, and rest. \n
For the comforting warmth of the sun that my body embraces, \n
For the cool of the waters that run through the shadowy places, \n
For the balm of the breezes that brush my face with their fingers, \n
For the vesper-hymn of the thrush when the twilight lingers, \n
For the long breath, the deep breath, the breath \n
of a heart without care,-- \n
I will give thanks and adore thee, God of the open air! \n
VI \n
These are the gifts I ask \n
Of thee, Spirit serene: \n
Strength for the daily task, \n
Courage to face the road, \n
Good cheer to help me bear the traveller's load, \n
And, for the hours of rest that come between, \n
An inward joy in all things heard and seen. \n
These are the sins I fain \n
Would have thee take away: \n
Malice, and cold disdain, \n
Hot anger, sullen hate, \n
Scorn of the lowly, envy of the great, \n
And discontent that casts a shadow gray \n
On all the brightness of the common day. \n
These are the things I prize \n
And hold of dearest worth: \n
Light of the sapphire skies, \n
Peace of the silent hills, \n
Shelter of forests, comfort of the grass, \n
Music of birds, murmur of little rills, \n
Shadow of clouds that swiftly pass, \n
And, after showers, \n
The smell of flowers \n
And of the good brown earth,-- \n
And best of all, along the way, friendship and mirth. \n
So let me keep \n
These treasures of the humble heart \n
In true possession, owning them by love; \n
And when at last I can no longer move \n
Among them freely, but must part \n
From the green fields and from the waters clear, \n
Let me not creep \n
Into some darkened room and hide \n
From all that makes the world so bright and dear; \n
But throw the windows wide \n
To welcome in the light; \n
And while I clasp a well-beloved hand, \n
Let me once more have sight \n
Of the deep sky and the far-smiling land,-- \n
Then gently fall on sleep, \n
And breathe my body back to Nature's care, \n
My spirit out to thee, God of the open air. \n<|endoftext|>

God is the refuge of his saints, \n
When storms of sharp distress invade; \n
Ere we can offer our complaints, \n
Behold him present with his aid! \n
Let mountains from their seats be hurled \n
Down to the deep, and buried there, \n
Convulsions shake the solid world, \n
Our faith shall never yield to fear. \n

In sacred peace our souls abide; \n
While every nation, every shore, \n
Trembles, and dreads the swelling tide. \n
There is a stream, whose gentle flow \n
Supplies the city of our God, \n
Life, love, and joy still gliding through, \n

Secure against the threatening hour; \n

And Jacob's God is still our aid: \n
Behold the works his hand hath wrought! \n
What desolations he hath made! \n
From sea to sea, through all their shores, \n
He makes the noise of battle cease; \n
When from on high his thunder roars, \n
He awes the trembling world to peace. \n
He breaks the bow, he cuts the spear; \n
Chariots he burns with heavenly flame: \n
Keep silence, all the earth, and hear \n
The sound and glory of his name: \n
"Be still, and learn that I am God, \n

You save our civilization and lives! \n

I PASSED along the water's edge below the humid trees, \n
My spirit rocked in evening light, the rushes round my knees, \n
My spirit rocked in sleep and sighs; and saw the moorfowl pace \n
All dripping on a grassy slope, and saw them cease to chase \n
Each other round in circles, and heard the eldest speak: \n
Who holds the world between His bill and made us strong or weak \n
Is an undying moorfowl, and He lives beyond the sky. \n
The rains are from His dripping wing, the moonbeams from His eye. \n
I passed a little further on and heard a lotus talk: \n
Who made the world and ruleth it, He hangeth on a stalk, \n
For I am in His image made, and all this tinkling tide \n
Is but a sliding drop of rain between His petals wide. \n
A little way within the gloom a roebuck raised his eyes \n
Brimful of starlight, and he said: The Stamper of the Skies, \n
He is a gentle roebuck; for how else, I pray, could He \n
Conceive a thing so sad and soft, a gentle thing like me? \n
I passed a little further on and heard a peacock say: \n
Who made the grass and made the worms and made my feathers gay, \n
He is a monstrous peacock, and He waveth all the night \n
His languid tail above us, lit with myriad spots of light. \n<|endoftext|>

The laws of God, the laws of man, \n
He may keep that will and can; \n
Not I: let God and man decree \n
Laws for themselves and not for me; \n
And if my ways are not as theirs \n
Let them mind their own affairs. \n
Their deeds I judge and much condemn, \n
Yet when did I make laws for them? \n
Please yourselves, say I, and they \n
Need only look the other way. \n
But no, they will not; they must still \n
Wrest their neighbor to their will, \n
And make me dance as they desire \n
With jail and gallows and hell-fire. \n
And how am I to face the odds \n
Of man's bedevilment and God's? \n
I, a stranger and afraid \n
In a world I never made. \n
They will be master, right or wrong; \n
Though both are foolish, both are strong. \n
And since, my soul, we cannot fly \n
To Saturn nor to Mercury, \n
Keep we must, if keep we can, \n
These foreign laws of God and man. \n<|endoftext|>

I would to God, that mine old age might have \n
Before my last, but here a living grave; \n
Some one poor almshouse, there to lie, or stir, \n
Ghost-like, as in my meaner sepulchre; \n
A little piggin, and a pipkin by, \n
To hold things fitting my necessity, \n
Which, rightly us'd, both in their time and place, \n
Might me excite to fore, and after, grace. \n
Thy cross, my Christ, fix'd 'fore mine eyes should be, \n
Not to adore that, but to worship Thee. \n
So here the remnant of my days I'd spend, \n
Reading Thy bible, and my book; so end. \n<|endoftext|>

god \n
God makes, He breaks! \n
God gives, He takes! \n
What tragedy! \n
What mystery! \n
What suffering! \n
What faltering! \n
But Why God does, no one can know! \n
Why He allows? Why He says, ‘No’! ? \n
This is the world in which we live; \n
Nature will not her secrets give; \n
Nevertheless, we can’t complain; \n
There’s harmony in boon or bane; \n
Who dare question Almighty’s ways? \n
We live a life of numbered days! \n
Yet, God is kind and cares for us; \n
Without the Lord, we shall be worse; \n
Some things happen which we can’t take: \n
We never know what’s true or fake; \n
The science we know turns obsolete; \n
Our labor seems at times effete; \n
And yet, men say that science is God! \n
-Believing which is rather odd; \n
The earth has built her devices, \n
Those mitigate human vices; \n
The man who thinks he is all wise, \n
Is sooner, later cut to size; \n
Who dare defy the Lord’s commands \n
Will slip into the Devils’ hands; \n
We have a code and soul to keep; \n
If otherwise, bad things we reap; \n
Man cannot curb Nature’s freedom; \n
Harnessing it is but seldom; \n
God made the man better than beast, \n
Promising him a sumptuous Feast; \n
If he lives not a better life, \n
God gives him woes, aplenty strife; \n
Through Nature’s fury, God reminds \n
-‘Man is God’s toy, which He rewinds! ’ \n<|endoftext|>

Since I am coming to that holy room, \n
Where, with thy choir of saints for evermore, \n
I shall be made thy music; as I come \n
I tune the instrument here at the door, \n
And what I must do then, think here before. \n

For, though their currents yield return to none, \n
What shall my west hurt me? As west and east \n
In all flat maps (and I am one) are one, \n
So death doth touch the resurrection. \n
Is the Pacific Sea my home? Or are \n
The eastern riches? Is Jerusalem? \n
Anyan, and Magellan, and Gibraltar, \n
All straits, and none but straits, are ways to them, \n
Whether where Japhet dwelt, or Cham, or Shem. \n

Christ's cross, and Adam's tree, stood in one place; \n
Look, Lord, and find both Adams met in me; \n
As the first Adam's sweat surrounds my face, \n
May the last Adam's blood my soul embrace. \n
So, in his purple wrapp'd, receive me, Lord; \n
By these his thorns, give me his other crown; \n

an invisible procession going by \n
with exquisite music, voices, \n
don't mourn your luck that's failing now, \n
work gone wrong, your plans \n
all proving deceptive--don't mourn them uselessly: \n
as one long prepared, and full of courage, \n
say goodbye to her, to Alexandria who is leaving. \n
Above all, don't fool yourself, don't say \n
it was a dream, your ears deceived you: \n
don't degrade yourself with empty hopes like these. \n
As one long prepared, and full of courage, \n
as is right for you who were given this kind of city, \n
go firmly to the window \n
and listen with deep emotion, \n
but not with the whining, the pleas of a coward; \n

Blessed with a joy that only she \n
Of all alive shall ever know, \n
She wears a proud humility \n
For what it was that willed it so - \n
That her degree should be so great \n
Among the favoured of the Lord \n
That she may scarcely bear the weight \n
Of her bewildering reward. \n
As one apart, immune, alone, \n
Or featured for the shining ones, \n
And like to none that she has known \n
Of other women's other sons - \n

He shines anointed; and he blurs \n
Her vision, till it seems indeed \n
A sacrilege to call him hers. \n
She fears a little for so much \n
Of what is best, and hardly dares \n
To think of him as one to touch \n
With aches, indignities, and cares; \n
She sees him rather at the goal, \n
Still shining; and her dream foretells \n
The proper shining of a soul \n
Where nothing ordinary dwells. \n
Perchance a canvass of the town \n
Would find him far from flags and shouts, \n
And leave him only the renown \n
Of many smiles and many doubts; \n
Perchance the crude and common tongue \n
Would havoc strangely with his worth; \n
But she, with innocence unwrung, \n
Would read his name around the earth. \n
And others, knowing how this youth \n
Would shine, if love could make him great, \n
When caught and tortured for the truth \n
Would only writhe and hesitate; \n
While she, arranging for his days \n
What centuries could not fulfil, \n
Transmutes him with her faith and praise, \n
And has him shining where she will. \n
She crowns him with her gratefulness, \n
And says again that life is good; \n
And should the gift of God be less \n
In him than in her motherhood, \n
His fame, though vague, will not be small \n
As upward through her dream he fares, \n
Half clouded with a crimson fall \n
Of roses thrown on marble stairs. \n<|endoftext|>

You are laughing in my human breast, \n
A Christ-child in a manger. \n

Strong heart of faith. O heart not mine, \n

Now taut, now loose, the threads of Why and When? \n
Giving passing heed--or be they one or ten-- \n
To one-time flesh but now the wind-blown clod? \n
If men can die who never yet knew life, \n
And, smiling, hold it is no strange affair; \n
Or live when death were welcome boon of strife, \n
Torn, broken sheaves the ghostly reapers spare; \n
The saints must grieve for earthly sorrows rife, \n
And God must heed, yea surely, God must care. \n<|endoftext|>

She must have known that fateful day \n

An officer of the law, \n

Not even time to draw. \n
The weapon that should have protected him \n
Stayed clipped upon his belt, \n
No way of ever knowing that day \n
how the cards of fate would be dealt. \n
His partner went down with him \n

Thier uniforms could not protect them \n
No badge or iron fist. \n
But she remembers his smiling face \n
As he left on that fateful morn, \n
Goodbye my love as he kissed her cheek \n
Then walked proudly out the door, \n
No way of ever knowing \n

Onward to her destination, \n
O'er the stream that Hannah sped, \n
When a cry of consternation \n
Smote and chilled our hearts with dread. \n
Wildly leaping, madly sweeping, \n
All relentless in their sway, \n
Like a band of cruel demons \n
Flames were closing 'round our way \n
Oh! the horror of those moments; \n
Flames above and waves below- \n
Oh! the agony of ages \n
Crowded in one hour of woe. \n
Fainter grew our hearts with anguish \n
In that hour with peril rife, \n
When we saw the pilot flying, \n
Terror-stricken, for his life. \n
Then a man up rose before us- \n
We had once despised his race- \n
But we saw a lofty purpose \n
Lighting up his darkened face. \n
While the flames were madly roaring, \n
With a courage grand and high, \n
Forth he rushed unto our rescue, \n
Strong to suffer, brave to die. \n
Helplessly the boat was drifting, \n
Death was staring in each face, \n
When he grasped the fallen rudder, \n
Took the pilot's vacant place. \n
Could he save us? Would he save us? \n
All his hope of life give o'er? \n
Could he hold that fated vessel \n
'Till she reached the nearer shore? \n
All our hopes and fears were centered \n
'Round his strong, unfaltering hand; \n
If he failed us we must perish, \n
Perish just in sight of land. \n
Breathlessly we watched and waited \n
While the flames were raging fast; \n
When our anguish changed to rapture- \n
We were saved, yes, saved at last. \n
Never strains of sweetest music \n
Brought to us more welcome sound. \n<|endoftext|>

A hero thinks of others before they think of themselves \n
A hero will die to protect \n
A hero can be of any age, any colour \n
A hero can be man, woman or child \n
A hero is courageous, loving and brave \n
A hero will never complain \n
A hero can be made in one act of compassion \n
Or years of tender loving care \n
Some hero's are remembered, whilst many are left forgotten \n
Hero's are angels in disguise, saving precious innocent lives \n

A face seen passing in a crowded street, \n
A voice heard singing music, large and free; \n
And from that moment life is changed, and we \n
Become of more heroic temper, meet \n
To freely ask and give, a man complete \n
Radiant because of faith, we dare to be \n
What Nature meant us. Brave idolatry \n
Which can conceive a hero! No deceit, \n
No knowledge taught by unrelenting years, \n
Can quench this fierce, untamable desire. \n
We know that what we long for once achieved \n
Will cease to satisfy. Be still our fears; \n
If what we worship fail us, still the fire \n
Burns on, and it is much to have believed. \n<|endoftext|>

Without sorrow life is zero \n
We must accept fate's arrow \n
If our efforts are thorough \n
Our sorrow, God will borrow \n
Sorrows nicely shape our mind \n
Sorrows stop our being blind \n
Via sorrows, remedies we find \n
Sorrows are indirectly kind \n
In the absence of sorrow \n
Our mind does not grow \n
We think not like a hero \n
Our attitude is made narrow \n
Sorrows must be overcome \n
For which efforts we welcome \n
At last strong we become \n
This is sorrows' outcome \n
Our will-power, sorrows increase \n
To our heart, sorrows supply grease \n
Our talents, only sorrows release \n
In a gist, sorrows supply peace \n
Every sorrow at last dies \n
Not because of our cries \n
But because our soul tries \n
Life and success, sorrow ties \n
Sorrow less person is none \n
Sorrow is sure, if life has begun \n
'Sorrow trains brains' is a slogan \n
Sorrow is a tamable dragon \n
In sorrow, all must dip \n
By coming under its grip \n
All are lashed by sorrow's whip \n
To every life, sorrow makes a trip \n
Now sorrow will somehow vanish \n
But you cannot fully relinquish \n
Further sorrows, time will furnish \n
From life, sorrow, none can banish \n
Life and sorrow are closely associated \n
By life, sorrow is very much fascinated \n
By sorrow, peace is initially confiscated \n
Sorrow grows when life is sophisticated. \n<|endoftext|>

Of all the boys with whom I fought \n
In Africa and Sicily, \n
Bill was the bravest of the lot \n
In our dare-devil Company. \n
That lad would rather die than yield; \n
His gore he glorified to spill, \n
And so in every battlefield \n
A hero in my eyes was Bill. \n
Then when the bloody war was done, \n
He moseyed back to our home town, \n
And there, a loving mother's son, \n
Like other kids he settled down. \n
His old girl seemed a shade straight-laced, \n
For when I called my buddy "Bill," \n
She looked at me with some distaste, \n
Suggesting that his name was "Will." \n
And then he had to get engaged, \n
And took unto himself a wife; \n
And so inevitably caged, \n
He settled down to wedded life. \n
He introduced me to his Missis, \n
But oh I thought her rather silly, \n
For in between their frequent kisses \n
She called my hard-boiled here: "Willie." \n
Now he has long forgot the War, \n
The which he did a lot to win, \n
And feeling full of ginger for \n
He's happy Pop of cherubs twin. \n
Yet with his air: "Don't care a damn," \n
On Main Street he's my hero still . . . \n
As proud he wheels a double pram \n
What guy has got the guts of Bill! \n<|endoftext|>

A man or woman who is intellect \n
Rewind at anytime without ejecting \n
Kindly and proudly can stand erect \n
To fight for any great cause \n
Like the man who they called Jesus \n
I look for someone who is near perfect \n
It is the one with bombastic imagination \n
A man or woman with prodigious vision \n
Assigned with an inconceivable mission \n
One who can sustain global peace \n
And preserve global justice \n
One who can feed hungry mouths \n
That lingers in countries all about \n
One who can inject love & strength \n
At any given moment \n
In any particular environment \n
Yet heroes have come and gone \n
Died in rain, war and sun \n
Some remembered, some forgotten \n
Withered away in time as rotten \n
Heroes have come and gone \n
If you are a companion in my thoughts \n
You will agree \n
My superhero is yet to be born \n

He was only 17 when it started \n
So big, but cute, and brave \n
We all wonder why it happened \n
As we sit here, digging his grave \n
Matthew was a soldier \n
Fighting for the U.S.A \n
He loved his country so dearly \n
That he gave his life away \n
It was 1941 \n
And we were fighting for our rights \n
Against the German soldiers \n
That kept us up all night \n
There leader was named Hitler \n
He was a cruel and an evil man \n
He discriminated other races \n
But the Jews were his number one plan \n
Matt decided to join the army \n
So this plan would not commence \n
And the world once more will be peaceful \n
For everybody’s expense \n
Matt was quite good in the warzone \n
Dodging the bullets that flew \n
Over and around his body \n
But he knew just what to do \n
Matt saw a man ahead of him \n
And snuck up to give him a smack \n
But realized it was just a boy \n
Who was caught up in the attack \n
Matt gave his life to save him \n
Protecting the boy in the field \n
Taking the bullets one by one \n
As if he were a shield \n
So now we sit and cry for Matt \n
As he was anything but a zero \n
Saving a child’s life with his own \n
Now that makes him “A True Hero” \n<|endoftext|>

Bullets came closer, soon I knew this burrow was not so hot. \n

Many of his comrades around him under gunfire did fall \n
Their names to be seen on War Memorial wall. \n
Back in the late sixties in distant Vietnam \n
He fought in an unpopular war as a young man \n
He received an honourable discharge from the army and a medal for bravery \n
And he now is an ageing man in poverty. \n
He never fathered children or never had a wife \n
And alcohol has become his sole comfort in life \n
Haunted by his dark war memories life for him an Earthly Hell \n
Had he not been in Vietnam at all in life he may have done well. \n
His war medal for bravery he has misplaced or lost \n
The two years he spent in Vietnam to him has come at a great cost \n
He looks far older than his sixty three years thin and stooped and gray \n
War leaves it's mark on it's survivors it does seem that way. \n<|endoftext|>
hero \n
No one sits with him \n
he doesnt fit in \n
we feel like we do when we make fun of him \n
cause you want to belong \n
Do you go along \n
his pain is the price paid for you to belong \n
its not like you hate him or want him to die \n
but maybe he goes home and thinks suicide \n
or he comes back to school with a gun at his side \n
and a kindness from you might have saved his life \n
Heros are made when you make a choice \n
you could be a hero \n
heros do whats right \n
you could be a hero \n
you might save a life \n
you could be a hero \n
you could join the fight \n
for whats rights, for what right, for whats right \n
no one talks to her she feels so alone \n
shes in to much pain to survive on her own \n
the hurt she cant handle overflows to a knive \n
she writes on her arm \n
wants to give up her life \n
each day she goes on is a day thats shes brave \n
fighting the lie that giving up is the way \n
each moment of courage \n
her own life she saves \n
when she throws the pills out \n
a hero is made \n
you could be a hero \n
heros do whats right \n
you could be a hero \n
you might save a life \n
you could be hero \n
you could join the fight \n
for whats right, for whats right, for whats right \n
no one talks to him about how he lives \n
he thinks that the choices he makes are just his \n
doesnt know hes a leader with hte way he behaves \n
and others will follow the choices hes made \n
he lives on the edge \n
hes old enough to decide \n
his brother who wants to be him is just nine \n
he can do what he wants \n
because its his right \n
the choices he makes change a nine year olds life \n
Heros are made when you make a choice \n<|endoftext|>

when u r alone \n
with an empty dark heart \n
thinking of your hero \n
to come and save u from darkness \n
u will keep thinking along \n
if he would come or not \n
if he would listen to your heart \n
thinking and thinking and thinking \n
thinking with no hope \n
never know if he would come or no \n

hero \n
A Hero is someone looked up to, \n
Who others could love to be, \n
A Hero is someone, who is very courageous, \n
And willing to put their life aside for another’s happiness or well being, \n
A Hero is anybody, anybody who can make someone’s day, \n
Or to help out with a simple chore, \n
A Hero does not have to be successful, \n
Or to complete their great intention, \n
A Hero does not have to be able to fly, \n
Nor to have any other superhuman power, \n
A Hero can be of any sex, race, or species, \n
They do not have to be human, \n
A Hero is not somebody, who is good at everything, \n
They don’t even have to be good at very well anything, \n
A Hero is somebody, who could only listen, \n
They could make you smile with out any words, \n
A Hero is someone, who could stand up for you, \n
Or to agree in your beliefs, \n
A Hero could be your Teacher, \n
helping you learn towards your future, \n
A Hero is anybody, and everybody, \n
Everyone is someone’s Hero, \n
And everybody has a Hero. \n

hero \n
Twas at the camp of Rorke's Drift, and at tea-time, \n
And busily engaged in culinary operations was a private of the line; \n
But suddenly he paused, for he heard a clattering din, \n
When instantly two men on horseback drew rein beside him. \n
"News from the front!" said one, "Awful news!" said the other, \n
"Of which, we are afraid, will put us to great bother, \n
For the black Zulus are coming, and for our blood doth thirst," \n
"And the force is cut up to pieces!" shouted the first. \n
"We're dead beat," said both, "but we've got to go on," \n
And on they rode both, looking very woebegone; \n
Then Henry Hook put all thought of cooking out of his mind, \n
For he was surrounded with danger on every side he did find. \n
He was a private of the South Wales Borderers, Henry Hook, \n
Also a brave soldier, and an hospital cook; \n
A soldier of the Queen, who was always ready to obey, \n
And willing to serve God by night and day. \n
Then away to the Camp he ran, with his mind all in a shiver, \n
Shouting, "The force is cut up, sir, on the other side of the river!" \n
Which caused the officer in command with fear to quiver, \n
When Henry Hook the news to him did deliver. \n
Then Henry Hook saluted, and immediately retired, \n
And with courage undaunted his soul was fired, \n
And the cry rang out wildly, "The Zulus are coming!" \n
Then the alarm drums were instantly set a-drumming. \n
Then "Fall in! Fall in!" the commanders did cry, \n
And the men mustered out, ready to do and to die, \n
As British soldiers are always ready to do, \n
But, alas, on this occasion their numbers were but few. \n
They were only eighty in number, that brave British band, \n
And brave Lieutenant Broomhead did them command; \n
He gave orders to erect barricades without delay, \n
"It's the only plan I can see, men, to drive four thousand savages away." \n
Then the mealie bags and biscuit boxes were brought out, \n
And the breastwork was made quickly without fear or doubt, \n
And barely was it finished when some one cried in dismay, \n
"There's the Zulus coming just about twelve hundred yards away." \n
Methinks I see the noble hero, Henry Hook, \n
Because like a destroying angel he did look, \n
As he stood at the hospital entrance defending the patients there, \n
Bayoneting the Zulus, while their cries rent the air, \n
As they strove hard the hospital to enter in, \n
But he murdered them in scores, and thought it no sin. \n
In one of the hospital rooms was stationed Henry Hook, \n
And every inch a hero he did look, \n
Standing at his loophole he watched the Zulus come, \n
All shouting, and yelling, and at a quick run. \n
On they came, a countless host of savages with a rush, \n
But the gallant little band soon did their courage crush, \n
But the cool man Henry Hook at his post began to fire, \n
And in a short time those maddened brutes were forced to retire. \n
Still on came the savages into the barricade, \n
And still they were driven back, but undismayed. \n
Again they came into the barricade, yet they were driven back, \n
While darkness fell swift across the sun, dismal and black. \n
Then into the hospital the savages forced their way, \n
And in a moment they set fire to it without dismay, \n
Then Henry Hook flew" to assist the patients in the ward, \n
And the fighting there was fearful and hard. \n
With yell and shriek the Zulus rushed to the attack, \n
But for the sixth time they were driven back \n
By the brave British band, and Henry Hook, \n
Who was a brave soldier, surgeon, and hospital cook. \n
And when Lord Chelmsford heard of the victory that day, \n
He sent for Henry Hook without delay, \n
And they took the private before the commander, \n
And with his braces down, and without his coat, in battle array grandeur. \n
Then Lord Chelmsford said, "Henry Hook, give me your hand, \n
For your conduct to day has been hereoic and grand, \n
And without your assistance to-day we'd been at a loss, \n
And for your heroic behaviour you shall receive the Victoria Cross." \n<|endoftext|>
hero \n
Brave Grant, thou hero of the war, \n
Thou art the emblem of the morning star, \n
Transpiring from the East to banish fear, \n
Revolving o'er a servile Hemisphere, \n
At large thou hast sustained the chief command \n
And at whose order all must rise and stand, \n
To hold position in the field is thine, \n
To sink in darkness or to rise and shine. \n
Thou art the leader of the Fed'ral band, \n
To send them at thy pleasure through the land, \n
Whose martial soldiers never did recoil \n
Nor fail in any place to take the spoil, \n
Thus organized was all the army firm, \n
And led unwavering to their lawful term, \n
Never repulsed or made to shrink with fear, \n
Advancing in their cause so truly dear. \n
The love of Union burned in every heart, \n
Which led them true and faithful from the start, \n
Whether upon water or on land, \n
They all obeyed their marshall's strict command, \n
By him the regiments were all surveyed, \n
His trumpet voice was by the whole obeyed, \n
His order right was every line to form, \n
And all be well prepared to front the storm. \n
Ye Southern gentlemen must grant him praise, \n
Nor on the flag of Union fail to gaze; \n
Ye ladies of the South forego the prize, \n
Our chief commander here to recognize, \n
From him the stream of general orders flow, \n
And every chief on him some praise bestow, \n
The well-known victor of the mighty cause \n
Demands from every voice a loud applause. \n
What more has great Napoleon ever done, \n
Though many battles in his course he won? \n
What more has Alexander e'er achieved, \n
Who left depopulated cities grieved? \n
To him we dedicate the whole in song, \n
The verses from our pen to him belong, \n
To him the Union banners are unfurled, \n
The star of peace the standard of the world. \n<|endoftext|>
hero \n
It lies not in our power to love or hate, \n
For will in us is over-rul'd by fate. \n
hen two are stript long ere the course begin, \n
We wish that one should lose, the other win; \n
And one especially do we affect \n
Of two gold ingots, like in each respect: \n
The reason no man knows; let it suffice, \n
What we behold is censur'd by our eyes. \n
Where both deliberate, the love is slight: \n
Who ever lov'd, that lov'd not at first sight. \n<|endoftext|>
hero \n
The heroes of the masses they live for their renown \n
And the masses create their heroes and then drag their heroes down \n
And the masses are unpredictable they change from day to day \n
And some of their heroes like the Autumn flowers are quick to fade away. \n
Yet there are millions of unsung heroes and they live on every street \n
And every day a hero I feel privileged to meet \n
True heroes male and female yet by the masses unsung \n
The World is full of heroes of heroes old and young. \n
Some heroes of the masses are arrogant and proud \n
And their egos over-swollen from the adulation of the crowd \n
But give me the unsung heroes who go their own quiet way \n
Who out of the kindness of their hearts perform one good deed every day. \n
Many heroes of the masses are not heroes to me \n
Though every day I walk the street some true hero I do see \n
Your hero is chauffeur driven and drinks the most expensive wine \n
And you can have your hero but your hero isn't mine. \n<|endoftext|>
hero \n
Unique friend imposible to find, \n
caring and loving for the ones who are, \n
The protector of broken hearts, \n
A true hero in my world. \n
Seems to be perfect for us, \n
but that's only what the eyes can see, \n
'cause my heart can see something else, \n
A vulnerable soul under it's shield. \n
My perfect hero has his sectrets, \n
Unknown for the ones who see with the eyes, \n
my hero is becoming weak with the time, \n
but he can't realize.... \n
The mind inside my hero, \n
Keeps feelings hidden, \n
for the ones he must protect, \n
to trust, and not be afraid. \n
A red rose in between many white, \n
similar to the others, but never the same, \n
feeling lonely on the inside, \n
wanting to hide and not to face the truth. \n
An exquisite prey in the jungle, \n
afraid of the hungry predators, \n
keep trying not to make any noise, \n
just avoiding to be haunted. \n
I can see him with my heart, \n
and I see his fears and his pain, \n
I understand he is only being human, \n
I still love him the same, \n
and still he is my hero.... \n<|endoftext|>
brother \n
I figured I should call you \n
Before I started drinking again. \n
Because you don’t answer, \n
I started without you \n
Since last night I had a vision \n
In which the planes were falling, \n
Again, a kind of religious silver rain. \n
And you became the lucky number \n
That slipped from the pant’s pocket \n
Of my childhood while incest was \n
Dug up behind the tomato vines \n
And all the flesh and bones bathed \n
In the hot south Florida sunlight \n
As the trailer with the holes in the \n
Floor was locked tightly before they \n
Began the raid on the immigrant workers. \n
They are advertising human sacrifice \n
On the billboards down Military Trail, \n
As people pass on from high-school \n
Forgetting such detritus as their locker \n
Numbers and first loves, \n
The way the shadows pooled under \n
The overgrown hollies in the early morning \n
Beside the bus-stop as the mist rose up \n
And the lions roared down the street. \n
And driving with ex-relatives barking \n
At the side of my face only to recede into \n
The hills where the snow is quickly melting, \n
The world turns old and further away \n
From the life gained from the sun \n
From which the old god walks away, \n
Leaving his destroyed garden to his bastards sons \n
Who perpetuate themselves through \n
Our sick games played out between the \n
Battlefields of eyes upon which even \n
The fly experiences strangulation on the \n
Dying eyelid of Cain’s unfortunate brother. \n<|endoftext|>
brother \n
The moment you were born \n
We were all happy to see you \n
You were precious gift to us from God \n
My mother held you in her arms \n
You were charming and we named you Deva \n
We hugged you a sign of affection and love \n
We hugged you a sign of little loving baby \n
You were growing up as special person \n
We took so much care about you \n
But your death brought us a great shock \n
I asked God why did my brother have to die \n
Our tears of sadness still roll over our eyes \n
And sad for our mother who believes you are still alive \n
I know when nature calls one has to leave this world \n
On that day I will meet you in the same world where you are \n
But till then my tears will not stop for you....... \n
My ever loving brother Deva. \n<|endoftext|>
brother \n
Follow the ravens who gather \n
in the weeping willows. \n
Silent and starving \n
near the bank. Dusk curls at \n
your feet. You watch the busy \n
hands of trees \n
pointing toward the river, divided \n
by an island. A dead ash stands \n
like a bone knife \n
Plunged into its chest. Black \n
swans swimming in it's stomach. \n
You whisper a prayer for the dying. \n
River bleeds over stone, smoothes \n
away rough edges. While the \n
moon perches on edge of some \n
unseen horizon. You wonder if \n
stars seek a sense of place. Step \n
over things as not to invade shadows. \n
You are certain they know the river \n
is bleeding. Know that you are the \n
one story that began out of place. \n<|endoftext|>

My sweet brother…! ! ! \n
I am blessed with a sweet little brother, \n
And I am thankful to god that he didn’t give me someone other, \n
We went to the same school, \n
And had our food in the same dining room, \n
Books had been his greatest enemies, \n
But he had to study because there was no other remedy, \n
Red marks were prominent in his result, \n
But still he never took them as an insult, \n
He believed in being playful, \n
And this was the only thing which he considered to be useful…! ! \n
But now he is a grown up guy, \n
Who doesn’t like toys and is not shy, \n
He is the one with whom I can share, \n
And he listens to me and never ever stares, \n
He cannot see a tear in my eye, \n
And this makes me feel not to give up and to try forever, \n
He has now become very responsible, \n
And I know if he gets the support he is very capable, \n
He is self obsessed with his looks, \n
And convinces us either by hook or by crook…! ! \n
I am gonna get married in a while, \n
And I know he has already decided about the style, \n
As he is there I am not worried about my mom, \n
Because I know his care and love will make her strong, \n
I am sorry for my mistakes, \n
But I love you to the core and this is one thing which no one can \n
take…! ! \n
Love you bhai….thanks for supporting me….! ! \n<|endoftext|>

His ears are ever vigilant be careful of what you do say \n
Big Brother he is listening from you he's never far away \n
Your words he may put a slant on and one word in the wrong place \n
Could see you in deep trouble the court you might have to face. \n
The Government allows free speech free to a point maybe \n
But when mere words can land you in trouble that does not seem free to me \n
And big brother is listening and he hears what he wants to hear \n
The best way of freedom curtailment is the weapon known as fear \n
And big brother he takes note every time you speak your mind \n
And if he sees something he does not like in trouble yourself you will find \n
He is the Government watchdog your words can see you in jail \n
Big brother is always watching you he even checks your mail. \n
Big brother he is listening even when your friends you phone \n
And even those who live on their own in truth are not alone \n
For big brother is with them though him they cannot see \n

And when she treats the gods, her noble meen; \n

O' th' sea-born princess, empresse too of fires; \n
The sacred arts and glorious lawrels torn \n
From the fair brow o' th' goddesse father-born; \n
All these were quarter'd in each snowy coat, \n
With canton'd honours of their own, to boot. \n
Paris, by fate new-wak'd from his dead cell, \n
Is charg'd to give his doom impossible. \n

But both were abused, \n
And had been for a while. \n
Their father was cruel, \n
Mean and heartless. \n
The way he hurt them, \n
Made it look effortless. \n
He locked her up, \n
In a room up the stair. \n
And left the house drunk, \n
Leaving her there. \n
He was hit from the mum, \n
A blow to the face. \n
The way they were treated, \n
Was an utter disgrace. \n
He couldn't get up, \n
He couldn't fight back. \n
For food to get stronger, \n
Was something he lacked. \n
The little girl was left, \n
Alone in the dark. \n
Cradling her arm, \n
On which was a mark. \n
Her wrist had been used, \n
To put out a cigarette stump. \n
Buring through the skin, \n
Leaving her with a lump. \n
He had been kicked, \n
When he was down. \n
Kicked for just being there, \n
Kicked down to the ground. \n
She had been someone, \n
For her parents alone, \n
To personally hurt, \n
When they were at home. \n
These children were hurt, \n
Outside and in. \n
They'd been physically abused, \n
And hurt right within. \n
Their pride had been banished, \n
Long, long ago. \n
They couldn't stand up, \n
And simply say, 'No! ' \n
The children died, \n
Not older than three. \n
The boy protecting his sister, \n
The girl clutching her teddy. \n
They had bruises, \n
Up and down their arms. \n
But they had escaped, \n
Escaped from further harm. \n
I wish that I could have, \n
Had the courage to speak. \n
To tell someone of this abuse, \n
That happened each week. \n
I could have made a difference, \n
For this little boy and girl, \n
I could have made a difference, \n
That they could mean the whole world. \n
So if you know of any, \n
Type of abuse. \n
Tell the helpline to today, \n
Before someones life is what we loose. \n<|endoftext|>

You are the best I have, my brother nice! \n
I know so well you suffer too like me; \n
Your heart is honest, broadminded, and wise; \n
I pray God must bless you quite soon surely. \n
You have a mind well-read, of course and sane; \n
I know that life has been to you unkind! \n
You are a boon, the elder son not bane; \n
Do continue your good work, I remind. \n
You are the one in whom I can confide; \n
Ever ready to help others always; \n
Don’t worry much, be brave; in God abide; \n
They are so nigh, your lucky, happy days. \n
So far, you have done well in life, don’t brood; \n
Be undeterred and never spoil your mood! \n

Many the wonders I this day have seen: \n
The sun, when first he kissed away the tears \n
That filled the eyes of Morn;—the laurelled peers \n
Who from the feathery gold of evening lean;— \n
The ocean with its vastness, its blue green, \n
Its ships, its rocks, its caves, its hopes, its fears, \n
Its voice mysterious, which whoso hears \n
Must think on what will be, and what has been. \n
E'en now, dear George, while this for you I write, \n
Cynthia is from her silken curtains peeping \n
So scantly, that it seems her bridal night, \n
And she her half-discovered revels keeping. \n
But what, without the social thought of thee, \n
Would be the wonders of the sky and sea? \n<|endoftext|>

My brother in law, AL \n
Is such a wonderful guy. \n
He doesn't walk on water... \n
But if he thought he could, \n
We would all watch him try! \n
A great brother and father... \n
And grandfather too! \n
There is nothing he would stop \n
For someone else to do! \n
He works like a team of horses... \n
Even when he is sick! \n
And when he takes time for himself, \n
We all worry about it! \n
'He's doing what? ? ? \n
NOTHING? \n
What's the matter with him? ' \n
He is 'always' so positive. \n
Although my sister Mim says, \n
'Oh, no he's not. \n
He can give much attitude! \n
And that's why I love him a lot! ' \n
She 'is' his better half! \n
They are a match. \n
That's why they remain attached! \n
My brother in law, AL... \n
Is a pal and a friend! I \n
I often ask him how he does it? \n
And he just laughs... \n
Or quietly grins! \n
He knows who he is. \n
And those who are blessed... \n
Have much respect and appreciate him! \n
But don't call him Alfred Lee... \n
Geeesshh! \n
A raised eyebrow to you he will send! \n
And even then... \n
He has a smile or a grin to show again. \n<|endoftext|>

My sister and brother grew up without their dad \n
though they wouldn't admit it, I knew it made them sad \n
Our mom always did the best that she could \n
for she knew he was out of their lives for good \n
It was his choice to stay out of their lives \n
it was the love of his children himself he did deprive \n
Now they are older and off on their own \n
His rejection of them he could never atone \n

brother \n
Full many a dreary hour have I past, \n
My brain bewildered, and my mind o'ercast \n
With heaviness; in seasons when I've thought \n
No spherey strains by me could e'er be caught \n
From the blue dome, though I to dimness gaze \n
On the far depth where sheeted lightning plays; \n
Or, on the wavy grass outstretched supinely, \n
Pry 'mong the stars, to strive to think divinely: \n
That I should never hear Apollo's song, \n
Though feathery clouds were floating all along \n
The purple west, and, two bright streaks between, \n
The golden lyre itself were dimly seen: \n
That the still murmur of the honey bee \n
Would never teach a rural song to me: \n
That the bright glance from beauty's eyelids slanting \n
Would never make a lay of mine enchanting, \n
Or warm my breast with ardour to unfold \n
Some tale of love and arms in time of old. \n
But there are times, when those that love the bay, \n
Fly from all sorrowing far, far away; \n
A sudden glow comes on them, nought they see \n
In water, earth, or air, but poesy. \n
It has been said, dear George, and true I hold it, \n
(For knightly Spenser to Libertas told it,) \n
That when a Poet is in such a trance, \n
In air her sees white coursers paw, and prance, \n
Bestridden of gay knights, in gay apparel, \n
Who at each other tilt in playful quarrel, \n
And what we, ignorantly, sheet-lightning call, \n
Is the swift opening of their wide portal, \n
When the bright warder blows his trumpet clear, \n
Whose tones reach nought on earth but Poet's ear. \n
When these enchanted portals open wide, \n
And through the light the horsemen swiftly glide, \n
The Poet's eye can reach those golden halls, \n
And view the glory of their festivals: \n
Their ladies fair, that in the distance seem \n
Fit for the silv'ring of a seraph's dream; \n
Their rich brimmed goblets, that incessant run \n
Like the bright spots that move about the sun; \n
And, when upheld, the wine from each bright jar \n
Pours with the lustre of a falling star. \n
Yet further off, are dimly seen their bowers, \n
Of which, no mortal eye can reach the flowers; \n
And 'tis right just, for well Apollo knows \n
'Twould make the Poet quarrel with the rose. \n
All that's revealed from that far seat of blisses \n
Is the clear fountains' interchanging kisses, \n
As gracefully descending, light and thin, \n
Like silver streaks across a dolphin's fin, \n
When he upswimmeth from the coral caves, \n
And sports with half his tail above the waves. \n
These wonders strange he sees, and many more, \n
Whose head is pregnant with poetic lore. \n
Should he upon an evening ramble fare \n
With forehead to the soothing breezes bare, \n
Would he nought see but the dark, silent blue \n
With all its diamonds trembling through and through? \n
Or the coy moon, when in the waviness \n
Of whitest clouds she does her beauty dress, \n
And staidly paces higher up, and higher, \n
Like a sweet nun in holy-day attire? \n
Ah, yes! much more would start into his sight— \n
The revelries and mysteries of night: \n
And should I ever see them, I will tell you \n
Such tales as needs must with amazement spell you. \n
These are the living pleasures of the bard: \n
But richer far posterity's reward. \n
What does he murmur with his latest breath, \n
While his proud eye looks though the film of death? \n
"What though I leave this dull and earthly mould, \n
Yet shall my spirit lofty converse hold \n
With after times.—The patriot shall feel \n
My stern alarum, and unsheath his steel; \n
Or, in the senate thunder out my numbers \n
To startle princes from their easy slumbers. \n
The sage will mingle with each moral theme \n
My happy thoughts sententious; he will teem \n
With lofty periods when my verses fire him, \n
And then I'll stoop from heaven to inspire him. \n
Lays have I left of such a dear delight \n
That maids will sing them on their bridal night. \n
Gay villagers, upon a morn of May, \n
When they have tired their gentle limbs with play \n
And formed a snowy circle on the grass, \n
And placed in midst of all that lovely lass \n
Who chosen is their queen,—with her fine head \n
Crowned with flowers purple, white, and red: \n
For there the lily, and the musk-rose, sighing, \n
Are emblems true of hapless lovers dying: \n
Between her breasts, that never yet felt trouble, \n
A bunch of violets full blown, and double, \n
Serenely sleep:—she from a casket takes \n
A little book,—and then a joy awakes \n
About each youthful heart,—with stifled cries, \n
And rubbing of white hands, and sparkling eyes: \n
For she's to read a tale of hopes, and fears; \n
One that I fostered in my youthful years: \n
The pearls, that on each glist'ning circlet sleep, \n
Must ever and anon with silent creep, \n
Lured by the innocent dimples. To sweet rest \n
Shall the dear babe, upon its mother's breast, \n
Be lulled with songs of mine. Fair world, adieu! \n
Thy dales, and hills, are fading from my view: \n
Swiftly I mount, upon wide spreading pinions, \n
Far from the narrow bound of thy dominions. \n
Full joy I feel, while thus I cleave the air, \n
That my soft verse will charm thy daughters fair, \n
And warm thy sons!" Ah, my dear friend and brother, \n
Could I, at once, my mad ambition smother, \n
For tasting joys like these, sure I should be \n
Happier, and dearer to society. \n
At times, 'tis true, I've felt relief from pain \n
When some bright thought has darted through my brain: \n
Through all that day I've felt a greater pleasure \n
Than if I'd brought to light a hidden treasure. \n
As to my sonnets, though none else should heed them, \n
I feel delighted, still, that you should read them. \n
Of late, too, I have had much calm enjoyment, \n
Stretched on the grass at my best loved employment \n
Of scribbling lines for you. These things I thought \n
While, in my face, the freshest breeze I caught. \n
E'en now I'm pillowed on a bed of flowers \n
That crowns a lofty clift, which proudly towers \n
Above the ocean-waves, The stalks, and blades, \n
Chequer my tablet with their quivering shades. \n
On one side is a field of drooping oats, \n
Through which the poppies show their scarlet coats; \n
So pert and useless, that they bring to mind \n
The scarlet coats that pester human-kind. \n
And on the other side, outspread, is seen \n
Ocean's blue mantle streaked with purple, and green. \n
Now 'tis I see a canvassed ship, and now \n
Mark the bright silver curling round her prow. \n
I see the lark dowm-dropping to his nest, \n
And the broad winged sea-gull never at rest; \n
For when no more he spreads his feathers free, \n
His breast is dancing on the restless sea. \n
Now I direct my eyes into the west, \n
Which at this moment is in sunbeams drest: \n
Why westward turn? 'Twas but to say adieu! \n
'Twas but to kiss my hand, dear George, to you! \n<|endoftext|>

Where below another sky \n
Parrot islands anchored lie, \n

Lonely Crusoes building boats;-- \n
Where in sunshine reaching out \n

Full of apes and cocoa-nuts \n

Hunting fish before his eyes;-- \n
Where in jungles near and far, \n
Man-devouring tigers are, \n
Lying close and giving ear \n
Lest the hunt be drawing near, \n
Or a comer-by be seen \n
Swinging in the palanquin;-- \n

Some deserted city stands, \n
All its children, sweep and prince, \n
Grown to manhood ages since, \n
Not a foot in street or house, \n
Not a stir of child or mouse, \n
And when kindly falls the night, \n
In all the town no spark of light. \n
There I'll come when I'm a man \n
With a camel caravan; \n
Light a fire in the gloom \n

I have now put the final cork away, \n

and put an end to it, \n
the pulse of time. \n

sleep \n
Gentle divinity, how have I merited? \n
Whither, unfortunate wretch, have I strayed, \n
Thus of thy bounty to lie disenherited - \n
I alone whilst every other is paid? \n
Sleeping are cattle and birds without number, \n
Beasts of the wilderness rest in their lair; \n
Even the hills, as if weary, feign slumber, \n
Even the torment sighs soft in the air. \n
Lulled are the shuttering waves of the ocean, \n
Seas in the lap of the land lie at peace. \n
Only for me in monotonous motion \n
Day follows day, and there comes no release. \n
Moonlight & starlight & light of the morning \n
Seven times flit o'er my feverish cheek. \n
Once again Dawn's chilly hand offers warning. \n
Whither, oh whither for rest shall I seek? \n
Had I the eyes of an Argus, nor heeded \n
Ever to keep my whole body awake - \n
Half of the sentries alone being needed - \n
Still I could never my slumber-thirst slake. \n
Yet - if there's one in the arms of a lover \n
Scornful of sleep and the joy that sleep brings, \n
Come thou to me! I'll not ask thee to cover \n
My eyes with the fullest extant of thy wings \n
Happier suitors may sue for such blessing, \n
I'll beg a touch, be it ever so slight, \n
Of thy wand, or a whisk of thy garment caressing \n
My eyelids to droop as it crosses the night. \n<|endoftext|>
sleep \n
In the sky there is nobody asleep. Nobody, nobody. \n
Nobody is asleep. \n
The creatures of the moon sniff and prowl about their cabins. \n
The living iguanas will come and bite the men who do not dream, \n
and the man who rushes out with his spirit broken will meet on the \n
street corner \n
the unbelievable alligator quiet beneath the tender protest of the \n
stars. \n
Nobody is asleep on earth. Nobody, nobody. \n
Nobody is asleep. \n
In a graveyard far off there is a corpse \n
who has moaned for three years \n
because of a dry countryside on his knee; \n
and that boy they buried this morning cried so much \n
it was necessary to call out the dogs to keep him quiet. \n
Life is not a dream. Careful! Careful! Careful! \n
We fall down the stairs in order to eat the moist earth \n
or we climb to the knife edge of the snow with the voices of the dead \n
dahlias. \n
But forgetfulness does not exist, dreams do not exist; \n
flesh exists. Kisses tie our mouths \n
in a thicket of new veins, \n
and whoever his pain pains will feel that pain forever \n
and whoever is afraid of death will carry it on his shoulders. \n
One day \n
the horses will live in the saloons \n
and the enraged ants \n
will throw themselves on the yellow skies that take refuge in the \n
eyes of cows. \n
Another day \n
we will watch the preserved butterflies rise from the dead \n
and still walking through a country of gray sponges and silent boats \n
we will watch our ring flash and roses spring from our tongue. \n
Careful! Be careful! Be careful! \n
The men who still have marks of the claw and the thunderstorm, \n
and that boy who cries because he has never heard of the invention \n
of the bridge, \n
or that dead man who possesses now only his head and a shoe, \n
we must carry them to the wall where the iguanas and the snakes \n
are waiting, \n
where the bear's teeth are waiting, \n
where the mummified hand of the boy is waiting, \n
and the hair of the camel stands on end with a violent blue shudder. \n
Nobody is sleeping in the sky. Nobody, nobody. \n
Nobody is sleeping. \n
If someone does close his eyes, \n
a whip, boys, a whip! \n
Let there be a landscape of open eyes \n
and bitter wounds on fire. \n
No one is sleeping in this world. No one, no one. \n
I have said it before. \n
No one is sleeping. \n
But if someone grows too much moss on his temples during the \n
night, \n
open the stage trapdoors so he can see in the moonlight \n
the lying goblets, and the poison, and the skull of the theaters. \n<|endoftext|>

HOW sleep the brave, who sink to rest \n
By all their country's wishes blest! \n
When Spring, with dewy fingers cold, \n
Returns to deck their hallow'd mould, \n

Than Fancy's feet have ever trod. \n
By fairy hands their knell is rung; \n
By forms unseen their dirge is sung; \n
There Honour comes, a pilgrim grey, \n
To bless the turf that wraps their clay; \n
And Freedom shall awhile repair \n
To dwell, a weeping hermit, there! \n<|endoftext|>
sleep \n
IN midnight sleep, of many a face of anguish, \n
Of the look at first of the mortally wounded--of that indescribable \n
look; \n
Of the dead on their backs, with arms extended wide, \n
I dream, I dream, I dream. \n
Of scenes of nature, fields and mountains; \n
Of skies, so beauteous after a storm--and at night the moon so \n
unearthly bright, \n
Shining sweetly, shining down, where we dig the trenches and gather \n
the heaps, \n
I dream, I dream, I dream. \n
Long, long have they pass'd--faces and trenches and fields; \n
Where through the carnage I moved with a callous composure--or away \n
from the fallen, \n
Onward I sped at the time--But now of their forms at night, \n
I dream, I dream, I dream. 10 \n<|endoftext|>

The generations of my forbears, yea, \n
The very will of God himself are there \n
And potent-working: so that many a doubt \n
Is wiped away at daylight, many a soil \n
Washed cleanlier, many a puzzle riddled plain. \n
Strong, silent forces push my puny self \n
Towards unguessed issues, and the waking man \n
Rises a Greatheart where a Slave lay down. \n<|endoftext|>

slides over my head \n
and walk with you through that lucent \n
wavering forest of bluegreen leaves \n
with its watery sun & three moons \n

towards your worst fear \n
I would like to give you the silver \n
branch, the small white flower, the one \n
word that will protect you \n

of your dream, from the grief \n
at the center I would like to follow \n
you up the long stairway \n
again & become \n
the boat that would row you back \n
carefully, a flame \n
in two cupped hands \n
to where your body lies \n
beside me, and as you enter \n
it as easily as breathing in \n
I would like to be the air \n
that inhabits you for a moment \n
only. I would like to be that unnoticed \n
& that necessary. \n<|endoftext|>
sleep \n
I fellowed sleep who kissed me in the brain, \n
Let fall the tear of time; the sleeper's eye, \n
Shifting to light, turned on me like a moon. \n
So, planning-heeled, I flew along my man \n
And dropped on dreaming and the upward sky. \n
I fled the earth and, naked, climbed the weather, \n
Reaching a second ground far from the stars; \n
And there we wept I and a ghostly other, \n
My mothers-eyed, upon the tops of trees; \n
I fled that ground as lightly as a feather. \n
'My fathers' globe knocks on its nave and sings.' \n
'This that we tread was, too, your father's land.' \n
'But this we tread bears the angelic gangs \n
Sweet are their fathered faces in their wings.' \n
'These are but dreaming men. Breathe, and they fade.' \n
Faded my elbow ghost, the mothers-eyed, \n
As, blowing on the angels, I was lost \n
On that cloud coast to each grave-grabbing shade; \n
I blew the dreaming fellows to their bed \n
Where still they sleep unknowing of their ghost. \n
Then all the matter of the living air \n
Raised up a voice, and, climbing on the words, \n
I spelt my vision with a hand and hair, \n
How light the sleeping on this soily star, \n
How deep the waking in the worlded clouds. \n
There grows the hours' ladder to the sun, \n
Each rung a love or losing to the last, \n
The inches monkeyed by the blood of man. \n
And old, mad man still climbing in his ghost, \n
My fathers' ghost is climbing in the rain. \n<|endoftext|>
sleep \n
She fell asleep on Christmas Eve: \n
At length the long-ungranted shade \n
Of weary eyelids overweigh'd \n
The pain nought else might yet relieve. \n
Our mother, who had lean'd all day \n
Over the bed from chime to chime, \n
Then rais'd herself for the first time, \n
And as she sat her down, did pray. \n
Her little work-table was spread \n
With work to finish. For the glare \n
Made by her candle, she had care \n
To work some distance from the bed. \n
Without, there was a cold moon up, \n
Of winter radiance sheer and thin; \n
The hollow halo it was in \n
Was like an icy crystal cup. \n
Through the small room, with subtle sound \n
Of flame, by vents the fireshine drove \n
And redden'd. In its dim alcove \n
The mirror shed a clearness round. \n
I had been sitting up some nights, \n
And my tired mind felt weak and blank; \n
Like a sharp strengthening wine it drank \n
The stillness and the broken lights. \n
Twelve struck. That sound, by dwindling years \n
Heard in each hour, crept off; and then \n
The ruffled silence spread again, \n
Like water that a pebble stirs. \n
Our mother rose from where she sat: \n
Her needles, as she laid them down, \n
Met lightly, and her silken gown \n
Settled: no other noise than that. \n
"Glory unto the Newly Born!" \n
So, as said angels, she did say; \n
Because we were in Christmas Day, \n
Though it would still be long till morn. \n
Just then in the room over us \n
There was a pushing back of chairs, \n
As some who had sat unawares \n
So late, now heard the hour, and rose. \n
With anxious softly-stepping haste \n
Our mother went where Margaret lay, \n
Fearing the sounds o'erhead--should they \n
Have broken her long watch'd-for rest! \n
She stoop'd an instant, calm, and turn'd; \n
But suddenly turn'd back again; \n
And all her features seem'd in pain \n
With woe, and her eyes gaz'd and yearn'd. \n
For my part, I but hid my face, \n
And held my breath, and spoke no word: \n
There was none spoken; but I heard \n
The silence for a little space. \n
Our mother bow'd herself and wept: \n
And both my arms fell, and I said, \n
"God knows I knew that she was dead." \n
And there, all white, my sister slept. \n
Then kneeling, upon Christmas morn \n
A little after twelve o'clock \n
We said, ere the first quarter struck, \n
"Christ's blessing on the newly born!" \n<|endoftext|>
sleep \n
My lungs respond, but there's no air, \n
As I struggle to survive, \n
It hurts to know that they don't care, \n
Whether or not I stay alive. \n
The world is growing dark now, \n
As I drift toward the light. \n
I want to cry out somehow; \n
If I had the strength, I might. \n
I feel like I am falling, \n
Into a great abyss. \n
I hear past loved ones calling, \n
As I taste Death's tender kiss. \n
Finally, I have found some peace; \n
My soul is God's to keep. \n
I have finally gained release, \n
By slipping into endless sleep. \n<|endoftext|>

And I, in the cage of sleep, on a stranger's breast, \n
Shed tears, like a task not to be put away--- \n
In the false light, false grief in my happy bed, \n
A labor of tears, set against joy's undoing. \n
I would not wake at your word, I had tears to say. \n
I clung to the bars of the dream and they were said, \n
And pain's derisive hand had given me rest \n
From the night giving off flames, and the dark renewing. \n<|endoftext|>

Sweet, warm dark of night \n
pull me in and hold me tight. \n
Help me fight this awful scourge \n
of sleeplessness, and the urge \n
to give up, get out bed, \n
to live the life of one Dead. \n
My mind and mouth are disconnected \n
as is my soul, it seems infected \n
with some loopy, crazened curse \n
from which I cannot wrangle verse \n
of any meaning or consequence, \n
much less poetic 'brilliance'... \n
Sing-song, sing-song - that manic rhythm \n
drives my brain, my hand, my very innards. \n
In fact, this morning I awoke \n
with these first lines like a choke- \n
hold on my mind - after just four hours \n
of nothing like sleep, too weak to shower. \n
At least I rested, this much is true; \n
my eyes no more bear reddish hue. \n
Still, I'm not sure which foot is right \n
and which is wrong, if it's day or if it's night. \n
Did I just put the cat in the sink - \n
the dishes out the door, I think? \n
(But I don't own a cat, so how -? \n
No, I won't worry about that now...) \n
My life's a shambles, the house in ruins, \n
I cannot count from one to two! \n
Sweet relief, where have you gone? ... \n

then you toss your head and stretch your little body \n
and turn around sleep again while holding your pillow \n
God brought you to me and given you as his gift \n
and today you are the greatest treasure in my life \n
Someone to laugh and dance and sing in my home \n
I love to watch you sleep my angel \n

teacher \n
With a special gift for learning \n
And with a heart that deeply cares, \n
You add a lot of love \n
To everything you share, \n
And even though \n
You mean a lot, \n
You’ll never know how much, \n
For you helped \n
To change the world \n
Through every life you touched. \n
You sparked the creativity \n
In the students whom you taught, \n
And helped them strive for goals \n
That could not be bought, \n
You are such a special teacher \n
That no words can truly tell \n
However much you’re valued \n
For the work you do so well. \n<|endoftext|>
teacher \n
The best possible words, \n
with the best possible meaning, \n
in the best possible order, \n
with the best possible structure, \n
in the best possible way. \n
That’s what I was once told poetry is. \n
But I pushed those boundaries, \n
and wrote in many different ways. \n
We should do poetry our own way, \n
no matter what anyone says. \n<|endoftext|>
teacher \n
I was twenty-six the first time I held \n
a human heart in my hand. \n
It was sixty-four and heavier than I expected, \n
its chambers slack; \n
and I was stupidly surprised \n
at how cold it was. \n
It was the middle of the third week \n
before I could look at her face, \n
before I could spend more than an hour \n
learning the secrets of cirrhosis, \n
the dark truth of diabetes, the black lungs \n
of the Marlboro woman, the exquisite \n
painful shape of kidney stones, \n
without eating an entire box of Altoids \n
to smother the smell of formaldehyde. \n
After seeing her face, I could not help \n
but wonder if she had a favorite color; \n
if she hated beets, \n
or loved country music before her hearing \n
faded, or learned to read \n
before cataracts placed her in perpetual twilight. \n
I wondered if her mother had once been happy \n
when she'd come home from school \n
or if she'd ever had a valentine from a secret admirer. \n
In the weeks that followed, I would \n
drive the highways, scanning billboards. \n
I would see her face, her eyes \n
squinting away the cigarette smoke, \n
or she would turn up at the bus stop \n
pushing a grocery cart of empty \n
beer cans and soda bottles. I wondered \n
if that was how she'd paid for all those smokes \n
or if the scars of repeated infections in her womb \n
spoke to a more universal currency. \n
Did she die, I wondered, in a cardboard box \n
under the Burnside Bridge, nursing a bottle \n
of strawberry wine, telling herself \n
she felt a little warmer now, \n
or in the Good Faith Shelter, \n
her few belongings safe under the sheet \n
held to her faltering heart? \n
Or in the emergency room, lying \n
on a wheeled gurney, the pitiless \n
lights above, the gauzy curtains around? \n
Did she ever wonder what it all was for? \n
I wish I could have told her in those days \n
what I've now come to know: that \n
it was for this--the baring \n
of her body on the stainless steel table-- \n
that I might come to know its secrets \n
and, knowing them, might listen \n
to the machine-shop hum of aortic stenosis \n
in an old woman's chest, smile a little to myself \n
and, in gratitude to her who taught me, \n
put away my stethoscope, turn to my patient \n
and say Let's talk about your heart. \n<|endoftext|>

teacher \n
Pat was the coolest teacher I ever knew. \n
My kids adored him. \n
He hated hypocrisy \n
and cant. \n
Pat loved kids. \n
Had two of his own \n
and a wife called Jan \n
whom he didn't like much. \n
Actually Pat didn't like ANY grown ups \n
very much. \n
He was belligerently left wing \n
(got into politics later) \n
Hated injustice \n
and most grown ups. \n
He used word conversations \n
to teach kids to read. \n
Let them use rude words too - \n
like bum and fart. \n
First time I saw him \n
he was covered with kids - \n
reading Mr Silly on the old couch. \n
He had a curly beard, \n
long hair tied in a rubber band \n
and blue eyes that really twinkled. \n
When he took the kids \n
to the local oval to play cricket \n
he always guaranteed a draw. \n
Said no one should take sport \n
too seriously. \n
Pat was the coolest teacher I ever knew. \n
My kids adored him. \n
He hated hypocrisy \n
and cant. \n
Some people said he was rude \n
(I suppose he was) . \n<|endoftext|>
teacher \n
I’m sitting in class, \n
My eyes about to close, \n
I hope teacher don’t see, \n
I hope she don’t see me. \n
Bored out of my mind, \n
Falling so behind, \n
Cannot concentrate, \n
I came to class too late. \n
Although I was on time, \n
My body was I mean, \n
My mind is still outside, \n
From class trying to hide. \n
What does all this mean? \n
I haven’t used it yet, \n
How can I retain it, \n
When already I forget? \n
And then she walks over, \n
That teacher of mine, \n
A smile in her eyes, \n
A gentle one at that, \n
She puts her hand on me, \n
And sets me kind of free. \n
Now here I am in class, \n
Learning about the past, \n
About history, \n
And what it did for me. \n
How we can learn, \n
From mistakes of old, \n
Of people so different, \n
Some so very bold. \n
Some stood against oppression, \n
Some stood against the wrong, \n
Some said it with dignity, \n
Some said it with a song. \n
I owe it to them, \n
And teacher here to hear, \n
What they did for us, \n
And no longer fear. \n
That knowledge is so dull, \n
No longer hurts my brain, \n
No longer hurts my skull, \n
It will surely keep me sane. \n
The past is the future, \n
Unless I stay awake, \n
So I can benefit, \n
There’s much more at stake. \n
Than I thought before, \n
Before I got to class, \n
Thank you History teacher, \n
For bringing to life the past. \n
I never got bored in History class, because I had a wonderful History Teacher. This is for her. \n<|endoftext|>

You know your true friend when you are in most need \n
For like 'tis said such a friend is a friend indeed \n
One who stands by you when you are feeling down \n
A cash strapped and depressed poor soul of the town \n
'Tis when you are most in need your friend you come to know \n
You ask one you thought was a good mate for a small loan his answer to you no \n
One who is not short of money of which you are aware \n
Yet a ten dollar note for you he could not spare \n
Yet a person you did not know well one you had met a few times before \n
Gave you the ten dollars and asked did you need more \n
That this person is your friend you've come to realize \n
In life every day there is some new surprise \n
In retrospect in years from now you will recall \n
That those you thought were your friends not your friends after all \n
A lesson for us to be learned from life every day \n
Life is a great teacher it does seem that way. \n<|endoftext|>

The final exams are in the offing \n
Mugging and bugging in full swing \n
Burning the midnight oil \n
Stumble to go to the next class \n
Youthful faces with awe in the look \n
Start the year with cheering sigh \n
I know each by name calling day and day out \n
Half yearly closes breaking half my heart \n
Reaching the wards as everlasting partners \n
Achieved by bricking inch by inch \n
Portions are over and prelims are done with \n
Gems are ready though not for sale \n
Comes the day call it farewell \n
Loading tonnes of grief into my heart \n
Students nay my children start \n
Praising me for anything and everything \n
Tears start rolling down my cheeks \n
Not that praise inebriates me \n
Fear of separation and pangs of love \n
Prick the heart with pin’s precision \n
Comes the vacation and birds fly off \n
Corrections to care, I go on with papers \n
Letters show me the person behind \n
Making me smile and cry \n
With pain in the heart and \n
Gain of centum result \n
I allow my children \n
To jump to the next class \n
Time rolls by with mixed feeling \n
Reach the school to the same class \n
New faces new hopes new feelings \n
Another set of children to make me happy and sad! \n<|endoftext|>

The Teacher isn’t a source of mere knowledge; \n
Neither is he a passive transmitter; \n
He frees the creative bird from the hedge, \n
And makes his students face their lives fitter. \n
The Teacher helps the student’s mind to grow, \n
In optimal a way, that’s possible; \n
The students needn’t the Teacher’s line just tow; \n
Curiosity that’s born is sensible. \n
His teaching methods must well suit young minds; \n
The doubts of students must be respected; \n
By introspection, every student finds \n
His strengths and weaknesses/ what’s expected? \n
Well, Teachers remove society’s evils, \n
Harnessing creativity of pupils. \n<|endoftext|>

And again my thoughts just fall off the page \n
None of the poetic leaves of my tree \n
Of feeling for him come back into play when \n
The pen hits the paper \n
He says I stroke his confidence \n
He will one day pin mine down \n
As the stars were playing tag team with my eyes \n
He was with my heart \n
Looking deep in to my heart \n
Looking deep in to my soul \n
Through the sexy curves of the letter O \n
For being so far away that’s all we have for now \n
In he’s charming poetic way he tells me that he cares for me \n
Oh yes from now until forever \n
The forever that’s beyond the sea \n
Beyond the ears can hear \n
And beyond the heart can break \n
I will care for him \n
So different from the others \n
They just wanna use me as their toy or for their joy \n
They just make me cry \n
Take advantage of my great desire and deceive my young mind \n
To get what they want \n
Not him \n
He is the one that calls me his princess \n
He is the one that has cute nick names for me \n
That makes me smile \n
Within his clever words \n
The feeling of I’m high starts in my eyes \n
The smile emerges on my face \n
The butterflies try to charge though my stomach \n
The need the desire becomes so great for him \n
He is my silent teacher \n
Teaches me what’s right and \n
What’s ever so wrong without even a sound \n
He will teach me so many things I’m sure of it \n
Things of mystery that I already know and \n
Some that are still a mystery to me \n

carpe diem \n
Wander not dear- blow with the fair breeze & fly the high seas, \n
All the fretting & sulking stoked, to find an enduring harmony in me, \n
Wander not into sounds that trick, with their spirited agonies, \n
Come seize the day, for we shall speak in the melody, God meant for you & me. \n
Look into my eyes; you shall reach the end of all your journeys, \n
Place your hand over my beating heart, & find it surpass yours in all degrees, \n
Like the butterfly, in a God endowed span, enjoys itself thoroughly, \n
Seeking nothing from flower to flower, save the sweetest of honey, \n
Live the joy & exuberance as God meant it, rest all must be memory, \n
Like the sweetness cast by the meekest flower, on a winter day, on a bended knee. \n
Let the cuckoos sing their sweetest, \n
Where lovers with a heavy heart rest, \n
Let the winds blow their trumpets \n
Where a lone candle burns in earnest. \n
Let the stars burn their brightest, \n
Let the darkest hour put them through the harshest test, \n
Let the coy flowers wistful in sobs of dew throw a riot, \n
In half shut eye, in half a dream reach their height. \n
Let the sunbeams open vaults of lit treasures, \n
And from each casement poet’s thought & sigh come together, \n
Let the moon in amorous pursuits, \n
In dew locks of the night, break into cold sweat. \n
With too great a capacity for joy, \n
When the world has little occasion for it. \n
Tarry not- for here I stand in abated breath, \n
Patient as the ants in your spell, I lie sedate, \n
When each moment pricks, like a thorn-embedded & plucked, \n
Before, in brooding fears & doubts, I drown, \n
Release me from this anguish, gently, to be reborn. \n
When the river persists the hills bow, \n
When the fruits heave the branches bestow, \n
Come monsoons the wind must with all his might blow, \n
Out on errands, the waning moon must return in her full halo. \n
Come the season, every tree pledges to burst into her splendor, \n
All entrusted with a purpose, a task to accomplish, \n
A soul to save, a heart to give away, a time to grant a wish, \n
For what do you wait- when God’s work lies incomplete at your door? \n
My time stands encased in a dew dropp in mid-air, \n
Holding my share of turmoil’s in sighs & cares, \n
While I knit verses in the trails of the birds & the bees, \n
Impart some sustaining truths that good things \n
come to those who wait on destiny, in a fighting frenzy. \n
Let's lend our heart's and spirits to light a hearth \n
And thereon, find new ways to measure our heart's girth. \n

carpe diem \n
It was a very long journey \n
Long enough to make one sleep on the way \n
But as brave as I was, I didn’t have a nap \n
Guess why? I walked it till my legs ached to my laps \n
I became so tired and exhausted \n
Behold, the journey was not over yet \n
I decided to do otherwise \n
By crossing the road to the other side \n
Immediately, a car parked at my front \n
I didn’t hesitate, so I entered \n
I alone at the back seat and no one else \n
“Alas! A transformation has taken place”, I said to myself \n
In a commanding but polite way, I uttered \n
“Please, take me to so and so” \n
The driver ignited the engine in haste \n
And zoomed off with the speed of my taste \n
I noticed someone else in front \n
Definitely he wasn’t the driver \n
He was putting on a uniform \n
An army officer he is with a gun \n
Someone driving me? \n
With an army officer in front? \n
And I alone at the back seat? \n
I must be a very prominent personnel then! \n
As we drove by the road \n
Pedestrians waved their hands at me \n
But their faces were not familiar at all \n
It was the driver who then waved in return \n
I still felt like a super star going fot a show \n
Or rather, crème de la crème of the society \n
This mustn’t be a dream, I prayed \n
But the journey was still not over yet \n
All of a sudden, the car halted \n
I was puzzled, for this wasn’t my destination \n
I said nothing so as to maintain decorum \n
Then, someone walked to the door and opened it \n
For me? I thought \n
My ego began to bloom \n
Immediately, he jumped in with others \n
I became perplexed with my mouth open \n
The seat became so tight, but the journey continued \n
Was I day-dreaming or what? \n
Attacked by mobs or a gang robbery? \n
With a security officer in the car? \n
No, they were minding their own business \n
Suddenly the car stopped for a second time \n
The driver turned to me and asked for my fare \n
I was still contemplating if or if not to pay \n
Till the officer gave me a scary look \n
I quickly complied, dipped my hand into my pocket and paid \n
Hurriedly, I jumped out \n
I peered at the top of the car \n
Lo and behold, it was a taxi \n
Indeed I was dreaming \n
A dream I longed for to come true \n
And the journey continued. \n<|endoftext|>

Hold my hand. As we pass the river of our lives. \n
Do not look back, as the rush of the water may be \n
too harsh. Look at my eyes. This is the only moment. \n
Do not look down at your feet. The water is flowing. \n
And flowing. There is nothing that you can hold \n
with your fingers and drink. It is and it will be impossible \n
to grasp, a past reality, a future possibility. \n
This is the only moment.This is the only truth. Grab it \n

The crown, carved for the greatest glory. \n
When you get there, writing your own heroic story, \n

carpe diem \n
The first night, the best night, \n
you had me at hello. \n
We went to your room, \n
and it was like I'd been there before. \n
My heart raced, my smile glowed. \n
We pulled out the cards, \n
and opened a beer. \n
Strip poker was not my strength. \n
Behind a pillow I hid, \n
behind my wall. \n
Your lips, my lips, \n
touched, my heart raced, beating louder then a drum. \n
I wanted your hands on me, \n
my hands on you. \n
We layed on your bed, \n
and talked long into the morning. \n
Our bodies embracing, \n
rubbing. \n
We didn't need sex, \n
to enjoy ourselves. \n
You sparked my heart strings that night, \n
my walls shifted. \n
Each time, everytime, \n
they come down a little more. \n
Yours are high, \n
but crumbling along side mine. \n
Don't let go my friend. \n
You and I are quite the pair, you know. \n
I would not shower with just anyone, \n
nor would I whisper my sweet nothings. \n
The things I do with you, \n
I hardly ever share. \n
If I was willing to try, are you? \n
If i put my heart on my sleeve, \n
would you take care? \n
How am I to believe you, how am I to love you, \n
and not think you'll be the same, as my first love? \n
My first love, my hardest love, \n
my deepest love. \n
I've never felt such pain, \n
I could not bare another such as that. \n
But for you, I'd be willing to try. \n
Do you believe me when I say, I care for you? \n
I do. \n
More then anything, I want to love you, \n
I want to be there for you. \n
Can I have your heart? \n
Share your thoughts with me. \n

carpe diem \n
Carpe diem 'Seize the Day' How bold... \n
Seize The Day. How does one do that? \n
Carpe diem, there are days, that like a \n
thief in the night, sneak up behind me, \n
and SEIZE ME! \n
Carpe diem...Seize The Day, how wonderful, \n
when there are days, that are within my \n
grasp...and then...I seize them! \n
Ahhh, now that I have them, I sometimes wonder, \n
what the hell do I do with that sized day, now? \n
I always was of the opinion that one should only \n
size the days, that they have a purpose for. \n
Now if I planed to stay indoors all day, what \n
would be the point of seizing the day? \n
On the other hand, to plan a lovely day, with \n
someone you care about-now that's a day to size! \n
Trust me, do not size any day, that you know not \n
what to do with. For if you do, you're dragging this \n
day around with you, not knowing what the hell \n
to do with it. \n
In all respects to the latins, who coined that \n
phrase, Carpe Diem, 'size the day, ' most of \n
them had no idea, what to do, with the day they sized! \n
Now the next time, someone utters those famous \n
words, Carpe Diem, 'size the day, ' look them \n
square in the eye and ask, \n
'If you size this day, what are you going to do \n
with it? \n

Strive for something that's wanted by so many? \n
How could I reach that lofty peak \n
Without performing an impossible feat? \n

Now cheers my drooping spirit so \n
Must cold and distant be, \n
And only light our northern clime \n
With feeble ray, before the time \n
I long so much to see. \n
And this soft whispering breeze that now \n
So gently cools my fevered brow, \n
This too, alas, must turn -- \n
To a wild blast whose icy dart \n
Pierces and chills me to the heart, \n
Before I cease to mourn. \n
And these bright flowers I love so well, \n
Verbena, rose and sweet bluebell, \n
Must droop and die away. \n
Those thick green leaves with all their shade \n
And rustling music, they must fade \n
And every one decay. \n
But if the sunny summer time \n
And woods and meadows in their prime \n
Are sweet to them that roam -- \n
Far sweeter is the winter bare \n
With long dark nights and landscapes drear \n
To them that are at Home! \n<|endoftext|>
green \n
I want a holiday with a scene \n
Of green, green and green \n
A summer of green trees \n
A landscape of green grass \n
A view full of green vegetables \n
The colour green \n
Is a beauty that must be seen! \n
From a moving vehicles screen \n
And while we hold onto those machines \n
That deprives us of the colour green \n
Remember they provide us vaccines \n
As well as help the air to be clean \n
So for green, green and green \n
I will travel continents across and in-between \n
And also to any place that I have never been \n
I will make it routine \n
Just to see green, green and green \n

I know a green grass path that leaves the field, \n
And like a running river, winds along \n
Into a leafy wood where is no throng \n
Of birds at noon-day, and no soft throats yield \n
Their music to the moon. The place is sealed, \n
An unclaimed sovereignty of voiceless song, \n
And all the unravished silences belong \n
To some sweet singer lost or unrevealed. \n
So is my soul become a silent place. \n
Oh, may I wake from this uneasy night \n
To find a voice of music manifold. \n
Let it be shape of sorrow with wan face, \n
Or Love that swoons on sleep, or else delight \n
That is as wide-eyed as a marigold. \n<|endoftext|>

So green the land that I can see \n
The hills and fields before my eyes, \n
Which blend with joyful harmony \n
Beneath the peaceful summer skies. \n
I breathe the morning air so sweet \n
So glad to be alive this day, \n
To see the new shoots of the wheat \n
And hedgerows now adorned with May. \n
Along the country lane I head \n
Not caring where it leads me to, \n
I know wherever I am led \n
I'll always find a pleasing view. \n
Beneath the bridge a river flows \n
Where ripples dance and brightly shine, \n
Like diamonds as the water glows \n
And winds unto this heart of mine. \n
The sweeping slopes of light and shade \n
Where clouds now cast their shade before, \n
With all the beauty there displayed \n
No man could ever ask for more. \n
So green the land that I can see \n
With gladdened soul I now do roam, \n
And as I go I say with glee \n
Fair England always be my home. \n<|endoftext|>

THERE is a green hill far away, \n
Without a city wall, \n

Who died to save us all. \n
We may not know, we cannot tell \n
What pains he had to bear, \n
But we believe it was for us \n
He hung and suffer’d there. \n
He died that we might be forgiven, \n
He died to make us good, \n
That we might go at last to heaven, \n
Sav’d by his precious blood. \n
There was no other good enough \n
To pay the price of sin; \n
He only could unlock the gate \n
Of heaven, and let us in. \n
O dearly, dearly has he lov’d, \n
And we must love him too, \n
And trust in his redeeming blood, \n
And try his works to do. \n<|endoftext|>

The Armies marched with banging drums \n
That made ill the streams, made black the dreams. \n
The Armies marched with cracking horns, \n
Each soldier robed in robes of green. \n
With green swords they cut her down, \n
Greyed her hairs and dimmed her smiles. \n
Their drums rung around her ears, \n
Their trophies hung within her tears. \n
But, in the night Turning Tide \n
Brought Light, who shone to crack the ice \n
That Time had made cold and hard \n
Around each green soldiers heathen heart. \n
Whispers. Whispers in my ears and in the hills. \n
'The ice will crack; the blood will flow', \n
The ice did crack, the blood ran cold \n
And drowned each green soldiers heathen soul. \n
We stood just to watch them die, \n
Let them bleed until their hearts bled dry. \n
Alas! things could never be the same \n
With her smiles so dim and her hairs so grey. \n<|endoftext|>

lost \n
Jack Kerouac wrote somewhere \n
America is a lonely crocashit. \n
I scribbled it down \n
And my ex-wife placed it \n
In Pablo Neruda’s book \n
Twenty Love Poems And A Song Of Despair. \n
I found it years after she was gone \n
And it made everything \n
Seem logical and reasonable. \n
But it is not just America: \n
Every place is afflicted \n
With terrible stinging tears \n
And loveless lives \n
And unfulfilled longing. \n
Like Kerouac, most poets \n
Are sad alcoholics; \n
Maybe everyone in the world \n
Is a lost poet. \n<|endoftext|>
lost \n
One dark, dark night--it was long ago, \n
The air was heavy and still and warm - \n
It fell to me and a man I know, \n
To see two girls to their father's farm. \n
There was little seeing, that I recall: \n
We seemed to grope in a cave profound. \n
They might have come by a painful fall, \n
Had we not helped them over the ground. \n
The girls were sisters. Both were fair, \n
But mine was the fairer (so I say). \n
The dark soon severed us, pair from pair, \n
And not long after we lost our way. \n
We wandered over the country-side, \n
And we frightened most of the sheep about, \n
And I do not think that we greatly tried, \n
Having lost our way, to find it out. \n
The night being fine, it was not worth while. \n
We strayed through furrow and corn and grass \n
We met with many a fence and stile, \n
And a quickset hedge, which we failed to pass. \n
At last we came on a road she knew; \n
She said we were near her father's place. \n
I heard the steps of the other two, \n
And my heart stood still for a moment's space. \n
Then I pleaded, `Give me a good-night kiss.' \n
I have learned, but I did not know in time, \n
The fruits that hang on the tree of bliss \n
Are not for cravens who will not climb. \n
We met all four by the farmyard gate, \n
We parted laughing, with half a sigh, \n
And home we went, at a quicker rate, \n
A shorter journey, my friend and I. \n
When we reached the house, it was late enough, \n
And many impertinent things were said, \n
Of time and distance, and such dull stuff, \n
But we said little, and went to bed. \n
We went to bed, but one at least \n
Went not to sleep till the black turned grey, \n
And the sun rose up, and the light increased, \n
And the birds awoke to a summer day. \n
And sometimes now, when the nights are mild, \n
And the moon is away, and no stars shine, \n
I wander out, and I go half-wild, \n
To think of the kiss which was not mine. \n
Let great minds laugh at a grief so small, \n
Let small minds laugh at a fool so great. \n
Kind maidens, pity me, one and all. \n
Shy youths, take warning by this my fate. \n<|endoftext|>

Another love lost, another love gone, just as the day done \n
I know another love will come. \n
But the love I lost I will never regain, Oh how could I \n

hardship and pain. Now I see that I was wrong because \n
My love is gone. \n<|endoftext|>

Have you ever had that feeling? \n
That you are completely lost. \n
Your mind and senses reeling, \n
As in a dark foreboding frost. \n
Nothing but nothing is as it seems, \n
Words like phantoms come and go. \n
It is as if all the bizarre dreams, \n
Have turned your brain to snow. \n
The ticking of the mantelpiece clock, \n
Cuts the silence like a knife. \n
Your mind is in a mysterious block, \n
You ask yourself is this my life. \n
Perhaps I am just getting old, \n
Brain and body gone to pot, \n
Where are the times that I was bold, \n
And my brain could solve every plot. \n<|endoftext|>
lost \n
In one of fhe States of America, some years ago, \n
There suddenly came on a violent storm of snow, \n
Which was nearly the death of a party of workmen, \n
Who had finished their day's work - nine or ten of them. \n
The distance was nearly twenty miles to their camp, \n
And with the thick falling snow their clothes felt damp, \n
As they set out for their camp, which was in a large grove, \n
And to reach it, manfully against the storm they strove. \n
The wind blew very hard, and the snow was falling fast, \n
Still, they plodded on, but felt a little downcast, \n
And the snow fell so fast they could scarcely see, \n
And they began to think they were lost on the wild prairie. \n
And they suddenly noticed marks of footsteps in the snow, \n
Which they found were their own tracks, as onward they did go, \n
Then they knew they were lost on the great prairie, \n
And what could they do in such a fearful extremity? \n
Then their hearts began to sink with woe, \n
In dread of having to pass the night in the snow, \n
And they cried, "Oh, God help us to find our way, \n
Or else we are lost on the lonely prairie." \n
And while they stood shivering with the cold, \n
One of the party a particular horse did behold, \n
Which was known by the name of Old Jack, \n
So to take off his bridle they were not slack. \n
When the horse was let free he threw up his head and tail, \n
Which seemed to say, "Follow ms, and ye will not fail. \n
So come on, boys, and follow me, \n
And I'll guide ye home safely." \n
And they cried, " Old Jack can show us the way, \n
So let's follow his tracks without dismay"; \n
And with the falling snow they were chilled to the bone, \n
But the horse seemed to say, "I'll show ye home." \n
And at last they gave a shout of delight \n
When they saw their camp fire burning bright, \n
Which was to them a cheerful sight, \n
And they caressed Old Jack for guiding them home that night. \n
And they felt thankful to God for their safety, \n
And they danced around Old Jack with their hearts full of glee, \n
And Old Jack became a favourite from that day, \n
Because he saved them from being lost on the wild prairie. \n<|endoftext|>

When the creation was new and all the stars shone in their first \n

---`It seems that somewhere there is a break in the chain of light \n
and one of the stars has been lost.' \n
The golden string of their harp snapped, \n
their song stopped, and they cried in dismay \n
---`Yes, that lost star was the best, \n
she was the glory of all heavens!' \n
From that day the search is unceasing for her, \n
and the cry goes on from one to the other \n
that in her the world has lost its one joy! \n
Only in the deepest silence of night the stars smile \n
and whisper among themselves \n
---`Vain is this seeking! unbroken perfection is over all!' \n<|endoftext|>

Often I think of the beautiful town \n
That is seated by the sea; \n
Often in thought go up and down \n
The pleasant streets of that dear old town, \n
And my youth comes back to me. \n
And a verse of a Lapland song \n
Is haunting my memory still: \n
"A boy's will is the wind's will, \n
And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts." \n
I can see the shadowy lines of its trees, \n
And catch, in sudden gleams, \n
The sheen of the far-surrounding seas, \n
And islands that were the Hesperides \n
Of all my boyish dreams. \n
And the burden of that old song, \n
It murmurs and whispers still: \n
"A boy's will is the wind's will, \n
And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts." \n
I remember the black wharves and the ships, \n
And the sea-tides tossing free; \n
And Spanish sailors with bearded lips, \n
And the beauty and mystery of the ships, \n
And the magic of the sea. \n
And the voice of that wayward song \n
Is singing and saying still: \n
"A boy's will is the wind's will, \n
And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts." \n
I remember the bulwarks by the shore, \n
And the fort upon the hill; \n
The sunrise gun, with its hollow roar, \n
The drum-beat repeated o'er and o'er, \n
And the bugle wild and shrill. \n
And the music of that old song \n
Throbs in my memory still: \n
"A boy's will is the wind's will, \n
And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts." \n
I remember the sea-fight far away, \n
How it thundered o'er the tide! \n
And the dead captains, as they lay \n
In their graves, o'erlooking the tranquil bay \n
Where they in battle died. \n
And the sound of that mournful song \n
Goes through me with a thrill: \n
"A boy's will is the wind's will, \n
And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts." \n
I can see the breezy dome of groves, \n
The shadows of Deering's Woods; \n
And the friendships old and the early loves \n
Come back with a Sabbath sound, as of doves \n
In quiet neighborhoods. \n
And the verse of that sweet old song, \n
It flutters and murmurs still: \n
"A boy's will is the wind's will, \n
And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts." \n
I remember the gleams and glooms that dart \n
Across the school-boy's brain; \n
The song and the silence in the heart, \n
That in part are prophecies, and in part \n
Are longings wild and vain. \n
And the voice of that fitful song \n
Sings on, and is never still: \n
"A boy's will is the wind's will, \n
And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts." \n
There are things of which I may not speak; \n
There are dreams that cannot die; \n
There are thoughts that make the strong heart weak, \n
And bring a pallor into the cheek, \n
And a mist before the eye. \n
And the words of that fatal song \n
Come over me like a chill: \n
"A boy's will is the wind's will, \n
And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts." \n
Strange to me now are the forms I meet \n
When I visit the dear old town; \n
But the native air is pure and sweet, \n
And the trees that o'ershadow each well-known street, \n
As they balance up and down, \n
Are singing the beautiful song, \n
Are sighing and whispering still: \n
"A boy's will is the wind's will, \n
And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts." \n
And Deering's Woods are fresh and fair, \n
And with joy that is almost pain \n
My heart goes back to wander there, \n
And among the dreams of the days that were, \n
I find my lost youth again. \n
And the strange and beautiful song, \n
The groves are repeating it still: \n
"A boy's will is the wind's will, \n
And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts." \n<|endoftext|>

so, after all these centuries of rhyme \n
and all the games of meter, dancing words, \n
should we now mourn its passing? \n
Have we lost the music of another world? \n
Instead, the easy unpretentious discourse, \n
sober, light, familiar, honest - \n
the world of daily, homely, shared sharp life, \n
that's now preferred. Not prose; \n
much more than 'chopped-up prose' as those may say \n
who think that poetry should be more visibly hard-earned; \n
- as if a human life set down in honesty \n
were not a poem in itself, unwrit; \n
'prose with enhanced consciousness' it's often now defined; \n
and consciousness - now that's earned, if you like... \n
and simile, and imagery, and metaphor - all the repertoire \n
of glorious poetry - they're all still here \n
to work their magic; if more played down, now, \n
unostentatious as T-shirt and jeans; \n
unostentatious as the beating, bloody heart. \n
And yet, when years bring tears \n
and time brings death and dying, \n
it's time for rhyme, to heal the heart \n
and charm away the crying. \n<|endoftext|>
lost \n
High on a throne of royal state, which far \n
Outshone the wealth or Ormus and of Ind, \n
Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand \n
Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold, \n
Satan exalted sat, by merit raised \n
To that bad eminence; and, from despair \n
Thus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires \n
Beyond thus high, insatiate to pursue \n
Vain war with Heaven; and, by success untaught, \n
His proud imaginations thus displayed:-- \n
"Powers and Dominions, Deities of Heaven!-- \n
For, since no deep within her gulf can hold \n
Immortal vigour, though oppressed and fallen, \n
I give not Heaven for lost: from this descent \n
Celestial Virtues rising will appear \n
More glorious and more dread than from no fall, \n
And trust themselves to fear no second fate!-- \n
Me though just right, and the fixed laws of Heaven, \n
Did first create your leader--next, free choice \n
With what besides in council or in fight \n
Hath been achieved of merit--yet this loss, \n
Thus far at least recovered, hath much more \n
Established in a safe, unenvied throne, \n
Yielded with full consent. The happier state \n
In Heaven, which follows dignity, might draw \n
Envy from each inferior; but who here \n
Will envy whom the highest place exposes \n
Foremost to stand against the Thunderer's aim \n
Your bulwark, and condemns to greatest share \n
Of endless pain? Where there is, then, no good \n
For which to strive, no strife can grow up there \n
From faction: for none sure will claim in Hell \n
Precedence; none whose portion is so small \n
Of present pain that with ambitious mind \n
Will covet more! With this advantage, then, \n
To union, and firm faith, and firm accord, \n
More than can be in Heaven, we now return \n
To claim our just inheritance of old, \n
Surer to prosper than prosperity \n
Could have assured us; and by what best way, \n
Whether of open war or covert guile, \n
We now debate. Who can advise may speak." \n
He ceased; and next him Moloch, sceptred king, \n
Stood up--the strongest and the fiercest Spirit \n
That fought in Heaven, now fiercer by despair. \n
His trust was with th' Eternal to be deemed \n
Equal in strength, and rather than be less \n
Cared not to be at all; with that care lost \n
Went all his fear: of God, or Hell, or worse, \n
He recked not, and these words thereafter spake:-- \n
"My sentence is for open war. Of wiles, \n
More unexpert, I boast not: them let those \n
Contrive who need, or when they need; not now. \n
For, while they sit contriving, shall the rest-- \n
Millions that stand in arms, and longing wait \n
The signal to ascend--sit lingering here, \n
Heaven's fugitives, and for their dwelling-place \n
Accept this dark opprobrious den of shame, \n
The prison of his ryranny who reigns \n
By our delay? No! let us rather choose, \n
Armed with Hell-flames and fury, all at once \n
O'er Heaven's high towers to force resistless way, \n
Turning our tortures into horrid arms \n
Against the Torturer; when, to meet the noise \n
Of his almighty engine, he shall hear \n
Infernal thunder, and, for lightning, see \n
Black fire and horror shot with equal rage \n
Among his Angels, and his throne itself \n
Mixed with Tartarean sulphur and strange fire, \n
His own invented torments. But perhaps \n
The way seems difficult, and steep to scale \n
With upright wing against a higher foe! \n
Let such bethink them, if the sleepy drench \n
Of that forgetful lake benumb not still, \n
That in our porper motion we ascend \n
Up to our native seat; descent and fall \n
To us is adverse. Who but felt of late, \n
When the fierce foe hung on our broken rear \n
Insulting, and pursued us through the Deep, \n
With what compulsion and laborious flight \n
We sunk thus low? Th' ascent is easy, then; \n
Th' event is feared! Should we again provoke \n
Our stronger, some worse way his wrath may find \n
To our destruction, if there be in Hell \n
Fear to be worse destroyed! What can be worse \n
Than to dwell here, driven out from bliss, condemned \n
In this abhorred deep to utter woe! \n
Where pain of unextinguishable fire \n
Must exercise us without hope of end \n
The vassals of his anger, when the scourge \n
Inexorably, and the torturing hour, \n
Calls us to penance? More destroyed than thus, \n
We should be quite abolished, and expire. \n
What fear we then? what doubt we to incense \n
His utmost ire? which, to the height enraged, \n
Will either quite consume us, and reduce \n
To nothing this essential--happier far \n
Than miserable to have eternal being!-- \n
Or, if our substance be indeed divine, \n
And cannot cease to be, we are at worst \n
On this side nothing; and by proof we feel \n
Our power sufficient to disturb his Heaven, \n
And with perpetual inroads to alarm, \n
Though inaccessible, his fatal throne: \n
Which, if not victory, is yet revenge." \n
He ended frowning, and his look denounced \n
Desperate revenge, and battle dangerous \n
To less than gods. On th' other side up rose \n
Belial, in act more graceful and humane. \n
A fairer person lost not Heaven; he seemed \n
For dignity composed, and high exploit. \n
But all was false and hollow; though his tongue \n
Dropped manna, and could make the worse appear \n
The better reason, to perplex and dash \n
Maturest counsels: for his thoughts were low-- \n
To vice industrious, but to nobler deeds \n
Timorous and slothful. Yet he pleased the ear, \n
And with persuasive accent thus began:-- \n
"I should be much for open war, O Peers, \n
As not behind in hate, if what was urged \n
Main reason to persuade immediate war \n
Did not dissuade me most, and seem to cast \n
Ominous conjecture on the whole success; \n
When he who most excels in fact of arms, \n
In what he counsels and in what excels \n
Mistrustful, grounds his courage on despair \n
And utter dissolution, as the scope \n
Of all his aim, after some dire revenge. \n
First, what revenge? The towers of Heaven are filled \n
With armed watch, that render all access \n
Impregnable: oft on the bodering Deep \n
Encamp their legions, or with obscure wing \n
Scout far and wide into the realm of Night, \n
Scorning surprise. Or, could we break our way \n
By force, and at our heels all Hell should rise \n
With blackest insurrection to confound \n
Heaven's purest light, yet our great Enemy, \n
All incorruptible, would on his throne \n
Sit unpolluted, and th' ethereal mould, \n
Incapable of stain, would soon expel \n
Her mischief, and purge off the baser fire, \n
Victorious. Thus repulsed, our final hope \n
Is flat despair: we must exasperate \n
Th' Almighty Victor to spend all his rage; \n
And that must end us; that must be our cure-- \n
To be no more. Sad cure! for who would lose, \n
Though full of pain, this intellectual being, \n
Those thoughts that wander through eternity, \n
To perish rather, swallowed up and lost \n
In the wide womb of uncreated Night, \n
Devoid of sense and motion? And who knows, \n
Let this be good, whether our angry Foe \n
Can give it, or will ever? How he can \n
Is doubtful; that he never will is sure. \n
Will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire, \n
Belike through impotence or unaware, \n
To give his enemies their wish, and end \n
Them in his anger whom his anger saves \n
To punish endless? 'Wherefore cease we, then?' \n
Say they who counsel war; 'we are decreed, \n
Reserved, and destined to eternal woe; \n
Whatever doing, what can we suffer more, \n
What can we suffer worse?' Is this, then, worst-- \n
Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in arms? \n
What when we fled amain, pursued and struck \n
With Heaven's afflicting thunder, and besought \n
The Deep to shelter us? This Hell then seemed \n
A refuge from those wounds. Or when we lay \n
Chained on the burning lake? That sure was worse. \n
What if the breath that kindled those grim fires, \n
Awaked, should blow them into sevenfold rage, \n
And plunge us in the flames; or from above \n
Should intermitted vengeance arm again \n
His red right hand to plague us? What if all \n
Her stores were opened, and this firmament \n
Of Hell should spout her cataracts of fire, \n
Impendent horrors, threatening hideous fall \n
One day upon our heads; while we perhaps, \n
Designing or exhorting glorious war, \n
Caught in a fiery tempest, shall be hurled, \n
Each on his rock transfixed, the sport and prey \n
Or racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk \n
Under yon boiling ocean, wrapt in chains, \n
There to converse with everlasting groans, \n
Unrespited, unpitied, unreprieved, \n
Ages of hopeless end? This would be worse. \n
War, therefore, open or concealed, alike \n
My voice dissuades; for what can force or guile \n
With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye \n
Views all things at one view? He from Heaven's height \n
All these our motions vain sees and derides, \n
Not more almighty to resist our might \n
Than wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles. \n
Shall we, then, live thus vile--the race of Heaven \n
Thus trampled, thus expelled, to suffer here \n
Chains and these torments? Better these than worse, \n
By my advice; since fate inevitable \n
Subdues us, and omnipotent decree, \n
The Victor's will. To suffer, as to do, \n
Our strength is equal; nor the law unjust \n
That so ordains. This was at first resolved, \n
If we were wise, against so great a foe \n
Contending, and so doubtful what might fall. \n
I laugh when those who at the spear are bold \n
And venturous, if that fail them, shrink, and fear \n
What yet they know must follow--to endure \n
Exile, or igominy, or bonds, or pain, \n
The sentence of their Conqueror. This is now \n
Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear, \n
Our Supreme Foe in time may much remit \n
His anger, and perhaps, thus far removed, \n
Not mind us not offending, satisfied \n
With what is punished; whence these raging fires \n
Will slacken, if his breath stir not their flames. \n
Our purer essence then will overcome \n
Their noxious vapour; or, inured, not feel; \n
Or, changed at length, and to the place conformed \n
In temper and in nature, will receive \n
Familiar the fierce heat; and, void of pain, \n
This horror will grow mild, this darkness light; \n
Besides what hope the never-ending flight \n
Of future days may bring, what chance, what change \n
Worth waiting--since our present lot appears \n
For happy though but ill, for ill not worst, \n
If we procure not to ourselves more woe." \n
Thus Belial, with words clothed in reason's garb, \n
Counselled ignoble ease and peaceful sloth, \n
Not peace; and after him thus Mammon spake:-- \n
"Either to disenthrone the King of Heaven \n
We war, if war be best, or to regain \n
Our own right lost. Him to unthrone we then \n
May hope, when everlasting Fate shall yield \n
To fickle Chance, and Chaos judge the strife. \n
The former, vain to hope, argues as vain \n
The latter; for what place can be for us \n
Within Heaven's bound, unless Heaven's Lord supreme \n
We overpower? Suppose he should relent \n
And publish grace to all, on promise made \n
Of new subjection; with what eyes could we \n
Stand in his presence humble, and receive \n
Strict laws imposed, to celebrate his throne \n
With warbled hyms, and to his Godhead sing \n
Forced hallelujahs, while he lordly sits \n
Our envied sovereign, and his altar breathes \n
Ambrosial odours and ambrosial flowers, \n
Our servile offerings? This must be our task \n
In Heaven, this our delight. How wearisome \n
Eternity so spent in worship paid \n
To whom we hate! Let us not then pursue, \n
By force impossible, by leave obtained \n
Unacceptable, though in Heaven, our state \n
Of splendid vassalage; but rather seek \n
Our own good from ourselves, and from our own \n
Live to ourselves, though in this vast recess, \n
Free and to none accountable, preferring \n
Hard liberty before the easy yoke \n
Of servile pomp. Our greatness will appear \n
Then most conspicuous when great things of small, \n
Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse, \n
We can create, and in what place soe'er \n
Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain \n
Through labour and endurance. This deep world \n
Of darkness do we dread? How oft amidst \n
Thick clouds and dark doth Heaven's all-ruling Sire \n
Choose to reside, his glory unobscured, \n
And with the majesty of darkness round \n
Covers his throne, from whence deep thunders roar. \n
Mustering their rage, and Heaven resembles Hell! \n
As he our darkness, cannot we his light \n
Imitate when we please? This desert soil \n
Wants not her hidden lustre, gems and gold; \n
Nor want we skill or art from whence to raise \n
Magnificence; and what can Heaven show more? \n
Our torments also may, in length of time, \n
Become our elements, these piercing fires \n
As soft as now severe, our temper changed \n
Into their temper; which must needs remove \n
The sensible of pain. All things invite \n
To peaceful counsels, and the settled state \n
Of order, how in safety best we may \n
Compose our present evils, with regard \n
Of what we are and where, dismissing quite \n
All thoughts of war. Ye have what I advise." \n
He scarce had finished, when such murmur filled \n
Th' assembly as when hollow rocks retain \n
The sound of blustering winds, which all night long \n
Had roused the sea, now with hoarse cadence lull \n
Seafaring men o'erwatched, whose bark by chance \n
Or pinnace, anchors in a craggy bay \n
After the tempest. Such applause was heard \n
As Mammon ended, and his sentence pleased, \n
Advising peace: for such another field \n
They dreaded worse than Hell; so much the fear \n
Of thunder and the sword of Michael \n
Wrought still within them; and no less desire \n
To found this nether empire, which might rise, \n
By policy and long process of time, \n
In emulation opposite to Heaven. \n
Which when Beelzebub perceived--than whom, \n
Satan except, none higher sat--with grave \n
Aspect he rose, and in his rising seemed \n
A pillar of state. Deep on his front engraven \n
Deliberation sat, and public care; \n
And princely counsel in his face yet shone, \n
Majestic, though in ruin. Sage he stood \n
With Atlantean shoulders, fit to bear \n
The weight of mightiest monarchies; his look \n
Drew audience and attention still as night \n
Or summer's noontide air, while thus he spake:-- \n
"Thrones and Imperial Powers, Offspring of Heaven, \n
Ethereal Virtues! or these titles now \n
Must we renounce, and, changing style, be called \n
Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote \n
Inclines--here to continue, and build up here \n
A growing empire; doubtless! while we dream, \n
And know not that the King of Heaven hath doomed \n
This place our dungeon, not our safe retreat \n
Beyond his potent arm, to live exempt \n
From Heaven's high jurisdiction, in new league \n
Banded against his throne, but to remain \n
In strictest bondage, though thus far removed, \n
Under th' inevitable curb, reserved \n
His captive multitude. For he, to be sure, \n
In height or depth, still first and last will reign \n
Sole king, and of his kingdom lose no part \n
By our revolt, but over Hell extend \n
His empire, and with iron sceptre rule \n
Us here, as with his golden those in Heaven. \n
What sit we then projecting peace and war? \n
War hath determined us and foiled with loss \n
Irreparable; terms of peace yet none \n
Vouchsafed or sought; for what peace will be given \n
To us enslaved, but custody severe, \n
And stripes and arbitrary punishment \n
Inflicted? and what peace can we return, \n
But, to our power, hostility and hate, \n
Untamed reluctance, and revenge, though slow, \n
Yet ever plotting how the Conqueror least \n
May reap his conquest, and may least rejoice \n
In doing what we most in suffering feel? \n
Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need \n
With dangerous expedition to invade \n
Heaven, whose high walls fear no assault or siege, \n
Or ambush from the Deep. What if we find \n
Some easier enterprise? There is a place \n
(If ancient and prophetic fame in Heaven \n
Err not)--another World, the happy seat \n
Of some new race, called Man, about this time \n
To be created like to us, though less \n
In power and excellence, but favoured more \n
Of him who rules above; so was his will \n
Pronounced among the Gods, and by an oath \n
That shook Heaven's whole circumference confirmed. \n
Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn \n
What creatures there inhabit, of what mould \n
Or substance, how endued, and what their power \n
And where their weakness: how attempted best, \n
By force of subtlety. Though Heaven be shut, \n
And Heaven's high Arbitrator sit secure \n
In his own strength, this place may lie exposed, \n
The utmost border of his kingdom, left \n
To their defence who hold it: here, perhaps, \n
Some advantageous act may be achieved \n
By sudden onset--either with Hell-fire \n
To waste his whole creation, or possess \n
All as our own, and drive, as we were driven, \n
The puny habitants; or, if not drive, \n
Seduce them to our party, that their God \n
May prove their foe, and with repenting hand \n
Abolish his own works. This would surpass \n
Common revenge, and interrupt his joy \n
In our confusion, and our joy upraise \n
In his disturbance; when his darling sons, \n
Hurled headlong to partake with us, shall curse \n
Their frail original, and faded bliss-- \n
Faded so soon! Advise if this be worth \n
Attempting, or to sit in darkness here \n
Hatching vain empires." Thus beelzebub \n
Pleaded his devilish counsel--first devised \n
By Satan, and in part proposed: for whence, \n
But from the author of all ill, could spring \n
So deep a malice, to confound the race \n
Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell \n
To mingle and involve, done all to spite \n
The great Creator? But their spite still serves \n
His glory to augment. The bold design \n
Pleased highly those infernal States, and joy \n
Sparkled in all their eyes: with full assent \n
They vote: whereat his speech he thus renews:-- \n
"Well have ye judged, well ended long debate, \n
Synod of Gods, and, like to what ye are, \n
Great things resolved, which from the lowest deep \n
Will once more lift us up, in spite of fate, \n
Nearer our ancient seat--perhaps in view \n
Of those bright confines, whence, with neighbouring arms, \n
And opportune excursion, we may chance \n
Re-enter Heaven; or else in some mild zone \n
Dwell, not unvisited of Heaven's fair light, \n
Secure, and at the brightening orient beam \n
Purge off this gloom: the soft delicious air, \n
To heal the scar of these corrosive fires, \n
Shall breathe her balm. But, first, whom shall we send \n
In search of this new World? whom shall we find \n
Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandering feet \n
The dark, unbottomed, infinite Abyss, \n
And through the palpable obscure find out \n
His uncouth way, or spread his airy flight, \n
Upborne with indefatigable wings \n
Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive \n
The happy Isle? What strength, what art, can then \n
Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe, \n
Through the strict senteries and stations thick \n
Of Angels watching round? Here he had need \n
All circumspection: and we now no less \n
Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send \n
The weight of all, and our last hope, relies." \n
This said, he sat; and expectation held \n
His look suspense, awaiting who appeared \n
To second, or oppose, or undertake \n
The perilous attempt. But all sat mute, \n
Pondering the danger with deep thoughts; and each \n
In other's countenance read his own dismay, \n
Astonished. None among the choice and prime \n
Of those Heaven-warring champions could be found \n
So hardy as to proffer or accept, \n
Alone, the dreadful voyage; till, at last, \n
Satan, whom now transcendent glory raised \n
Above his fellows, with monarchal pride \n
Conscious of highest worth, unmoved thus spake:-- \n
"O Progeny of Heaven! Empyreal Thrones! \n
With reason hath deep silence and demur \n
Seized us, though undismayed. Long is the way \n
And hard, that out of Hell leads up to light. \n
Our prison strong, this huge convex of fire, \n
Outrageous to devour, immures us round \n
Ninefold; and gates of burning adamant, \n
Barred over us, prohibit all egress. \n
These passed, if any pass, the void profound \n
Of unessential Night receives him next, \n
Wide-gaping, and with utter loss of being \n
Threatens him, plunged in that abortive gulf. \n
If thence he scape, into whatever world, \n
Or unknown region, what remains him less \n
Than unknown dangers, and as hard escape? \n
But I should ill become this throne, O Peers, \n
And this imperial sovereignty, adorned \n
With splendour, armed with power, if aught proposed \n
And judged of public moment in the shape \n
Of difficulty or danger, could deter \n
Me from attempting. Wherefore do I assume \n
These royalties, and not refuse to reign, \n
Refusing to accept as great a share \n
Of hazard as of honour, due alike \n
To him who reigns, and so much to him due \n
Of hazard more as he above the rest \n
High honoured sits? Go, therefore, mighty Powers, \n
Terror of Heaven, though fallen; intend at home, \n
While here shall be our home, what best may ease \n
The present misery, and render Hell \n
More tolerable; if there be cure or charm \n
To respite, or deceive, or slack the pain \n
Of this ill mansion: intermit no watch \n
Against a wakeful foe, while I abroad \n
Through all the coasts of dark destruction seek \n
Deliverance for us all. This enterprise \n
None shall partake with me." Thus saying, rose \n
The Monarch, and prevented all reply; \n
Prudent lest, from his resolution raised, \n
Others among the chief might offer now, \n
Certain to be refused, what erst they feared, \n
And, so refused, might in opinion stand \n
His rivals, winning cheap the high repute \n
Which he through hazard huge must earn. But they \n
Dreaded not more th' adventure than his voice \n
Forbidding; and at once with him they rose. \n
Their rising all at once was as the sound \n
Of thunder heard remote. Towards him they bend \n
With awful reverence prone, and as a God \n
Extol him equal to the Highest in Heaven. \n
Nor failed they to express how much they praised \n
That for the general safety he despised \n
His own: for neither do the Spirits damned \n
Lose all their virtue; lest bad men should boast \n
Their specious deeds on earth, which glory excites, \n
Or close ambition varnished o'er with zeal. \n
Thus they their doubtful consultations dark \n
Ended, rejoicing in their matchless Chief: \n
As, when from mountain-tops the dusky clouds \n
Ascending, while the north wind sleeps, o'erspread \n
Heaven's cheerful face, the louring element \n
Scowls o'er the darkened landscape snow or shower, \n
If chance the radiant sun, with farewell sweet, \n
Extend his evening beam, the fields revive, \n
The birds their notes renew, and bleating herds \n
Attest their joy, that hill and valley rings. \n
O shame to men! Devil with devil damned \n
Firm concord holds; men only disagree \n
Of creatures rational, though under hope \n
Of heavenly grace, and, God proclaiming peace, \n
Yet live in hatred, enmity, and strife \n
Among themselves, and levy cruel wars \n
Wasting the earth, each other to destroy: \n
As if (which might induce us to accord) \n
Man had not hellish foes enow besides, \n
That day and night for his destruction wait! \n
The Stygian council thus dissolved; and forth \n
In order came the grand infernal Peers: \n
Midst came their mighty Paramount, and seemed \n
Alone th' antagonist of Heaven, nor less \n
Than Hell's dread Emperor, with pomp supreme, \n
And god-like imitated state: him round \n
A globe of fiery Seraphim enclosed \n
With bright emblazonry, and horrent arms. \n
Then of their session ended they bid cry \n
With trumpet's regal sound the great result: \n
Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim \n
Put to their mouths the sounding alchemy, \n
By herald's voice explained; the hollow Abyss \n
Heard far adn wide, and all the host of Hell \n
With deafening shout returned them loud acclaim. \n
Thence more at ease their minds, and somewhat raised \n
By false presumptuous hope, the ranged Powers \n
Disband; and, wandering, each his several way \n
Pursues, as inclination or sad choice \n
Leads him perplexed, where he may likeliest find \n
Truce to his restless thoughts, and entertain \n
The irksome hours, till his great Chief return. \n
Part on the plain, or in the air sublime, \n
Upon the wing or in swift race contend, \n
As at th' Olympian games or Pythian fields; \n
Part curb their fiery steeds, or shun the goal \n
With rapid wheels, or fronted brigades form: \n
As when, to warn proud cities, war appears \n
Waged in the troubled sky, and armies rush \n
To battle in the clouds; before each van \n
Prick forth the airy knights, and couch their spears, \n
Till thickest legions close; with feats of arms \n
From either end of heaven the welkin burns. \n
Others, with vast Typhoean rage, more fell, \n
Rend up both rocks and hills, and ride the air \n
In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wild uproar:-- \n
As when Alcides, from Oechalia crowned \n
With conquest, felt th' envenomed robe, and tore \n
Through pain up by the roots Thessalian pines, \n
And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw \n
Into th' Euboic sea. Others, more mild, \n
Retreated in a silent valley, sing \n
With notes angelical to many a harp \n
Their own heroic deeds, and hapless fall \n
By doom of battle, and complain that Fate \n
Free Virtue should enthrall to Force or Chance. \n
Their song was partial; but the harmony \n
(What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?) \n
Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment \n
The thronging audience. In discourse more sweet \n
(For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense) \n
Others apart sat on a hill retired, \n
In thoughts more elevate, and reasoned high \n
Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will, and Fate-- \n
Fixed fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute, \n
And found no end, in wandering mazes lost. \n
Of good and evil much they argued then, \n
Of happiness and final misery, \n
Passion and apathy, and glory and shame: \n
Vain wisdom all, and false philosophy!-- \n
Yet, with a pleasing sorcery, could charm \n
Pain for a while or anguish, and excite \n
Fallacious hope, or arm th' obdured breast \n
With stubborn patience as with triple steel. \n
Another part, in squadrons and gross bands, \n
On bold adventure to discover wide \n
That dismal world, if any clime perhaps \n
Might yield them easier habitation, bend \n
Four ways their flying march, along the banks \n
Of four infernal rivers, that disgorge \n
Into the burning lake their baleful streams-- \n
Abhorred Styx, the flood of deadly hate; \n
Sad Acheron of sorrow, black and deep; \n
Cocytus, named of lamentation loud \n
Heard on the rueful stream; fierce Phlegeton, \n
Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage. \n
Far off from these, a slow and silent stream, \n
Lethe, the river of oblivion, rolls \n
Her watery labyrinth, whereof who drinks \n
Forthwith his former state and being forgets-- \n
Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain. \n
Beyond this flood a frozen continent \n
Lies dark and wild, beat with perpetual storms \n
Of whirlwind and dire hail, which on firm land \n
Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems \n
Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice, \n
A gulf profound as that Serbonian bog \n
Betwixt Damiata and Mount Casius old, \n
Where armies whole have sunk: the parching air \n
Burns frore, and cold performs th' effect of fire. \n
Thither, by harpy-footed Furies haled, \n
At certain revolutions all the damned \n
Are brought; and feel by turns the bitter change \n
Of fierce extremes, extremes by change more fierce, \n
From beds of raging fire to starve in ice \n
Their soft ethereal warmth, and there to pine \n
Immovable, infixed, and frozen round \n
Periods of time,--thence hurried back to fire. \n
They ferry over this Lethean sound \n
Both to and fro, their sorrow to augment, \n
And wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach \n
The tempting stream, with one small drop to lose \n
In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe, \n
All in one moment, and so near the brink; \n
But Fate withstands, and, to oppose th' attempt, \n
Medusa with Gorgonian terror guards \n
The ford, and of itself the water flies \n
All taste of living wight, as once it fled \n
The lip of Tantalus. Thus roving on \n
In confused march forlorn, th' adventurous bands, \n
With shuddering horror pale, and eyes aghast, \n
Viewed first their lamentable lot, and found \n
No rest. Through many a dark and dreary vale \n
They passed, and many a region dolorous, \n
O'er many a frozen, many a fiery alp, \n
Rocks, caves, lakes, fens, bogs, dens, and shades of death-- \n
A universe of death, which God by curse \n
Created evil, for evil only good; \n
Where all life dies, death lives, and Nature breeds, \n
Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things, \n
Obominable, inutterable, and worse \n
Than fables yet have feigned or fear conceived, \n
Gorgons, and Hydras, and Chimeras dire. \n
Meanwhile the Adversary of God and Man, \n
Satan, with thoughts inflamed of highest design, \n
Puts on swift wings, and toward the gates of Hell \n
Explores his solitary flight: sometimes \n
He scours the right hand coast, sometimes the left; \n
Now shaves with level wing the deep, then soars \n
Up to the fiery concave towering high. \n
As when far off at sea a fleet descried \n
Hangs in the clouds, by equinoctial winds \n
Close sailing from Bengala, or the isles \n
Of Ternate and Tidore, whence merchants bring \n
Their spicy drugs; they on the trading flood, \n
Through the wide Ethiopian to the Cape, \n
Ply stemming nightly toward the pole: so seemed \n
Far off the flying Fiend. At last appear \n
Hell-bounds, high reaching to the horrid roof, \n
And thrice threefold the gates; three folds were brass, \n
Three iron, three of adamantine rock, \n
Impenetrable, impaled with circling fire, \n
Yet unconsumed. Before the gates there sat \n
On either side a formidable Shape. \n
The one seemed woman to the waist, and fair, \n
But ended foul in many a scaly fold, \n
Voluminous and vast--a serpent armed \n
With mortal sting. About her middle round \n
A cry of Hell-hounds never-ceasing barked \n
With wide Cerberean mouths full loud, and rung \n
A hideous peal; yet, when they list, would creep, \n
If aught disturbed their noise, into her womb, \n
And kennel there; yet there still barked and howled \n
Within unseen. Far less abhorred than these \n
Vexed Scylla, bathing in the sea that parts \n
Calabria from the hoarse Trinacrian shore; \n
Nor uglier follow the night-hag, when, called \n
In secret, riding through the air she comes, \n
Lured with the smell of infant blood, to dance \n
With Lapland witches, while the labouring moon \n
Eclipses at their charms. The other Shape-- \n
If shape it might be called that shape had none \n
Distinguishable in member, joint, or limb; \n
Or substance might be called that shadow seemed, \n
For each seemed either--black it stood as Night, \n
Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell, \n
And shook a dreadful dart: what seemed his head \n
The likeness of a kingly crown had on. \n
Satan was now at hand, and from his seat \n
The monster moving onward came as fast \n
With horrid strides; Hell trembled as he strode. \n
Th' undaunted Fiend what this might be admired-- \n
Admired, not feared (God and his Son except, \n
Created thing naught valued he nor shunned), \n
And with disdainful look thus first began:-- \n
"Whence and what art thou, execrable Shape, \n
That dar'st, though grim and terrible, advance \n
Thy miscreated front athwart my way \n
To yonder gates? Through them I mean to pass, \n
That be assured, without leave asked of thee. \n
Retire; or taste thy folly, and learn by proof, \n
Hell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heaven." \n
To whom the Goblin, full of wrath, replied:-- \n
"Art thou that traitor Angel? art thou he, \n
Who first broke peace in Heaven and faith, till then \n
Unbroken, and in proud rebellious arms \n
Drew after him the third part of Heaven's sons, \n
Conjured against the Highest--for which both thou \n
And they, outcast from God, are here condemned \n
To waste eternal days in woe and pain? \n
And reckon'st thou thyself with Spirits of Heaven \n
Hell-doomed, and breath'st defiance here and scorn, \n
Where I reign king, and, to enrage thee more, \n
Thy king and lord? Back to thy punishment, \n
False fugitive; and to thy speed add wings, \n
Lest with a whip of scorpions I pursue \n
Thy lingering, or with one stroke of this dart \n
Strange horror seize thee, and pangs unfelt before." \n
So spake the grisly Terror, and in shape, \n
So speaking and so threatening, grew tenfold, \n
More dreadful and deform. On th' other side, \n
Incensed with indignation, Satan stood \n
Unterrified, and like a comet burned, \n
That fires the length of Ophiuchus huge \n
In th' arctic sky, and from his horrid hair \n
Shakes pestilence and war. Each at the head \n
Levelled his deadly aim; their fatal hands \n
No second stroke intend; and such a frown \n
Each cast at th' other as when two black clouds, \n
With heaven's artillery fraught, came rattling on \n
Over the Caspian,--then stand front to front \n
Hovering a space, till winds the signal blow \n
To join their dark encounter in mid-air. \n
So frowned the mighty combatants that Hell \n
Grew darker at their frown; so matched they stood; \n
For never but once more was wither like \n
To meet so great a foe. And now great deeds \n
Had been achieved, whereof all Hell had rung, \n
Had not the snaky Sorceress, that sat \n
Fast by Hell-gate and kept the fatal key, \n
Risen, and with hideous outcry rushed between. \n
"O father, what intends thy hand," she cried, \n
"Against thy only son? What fury, O son, \n
Possesses thee to bend that mortal dart \n
Against thy father's head? And know'st for whom? \n
For him who sits above, and laughs the while \n
At thee, ordained his drudge to execute \n
Whate'er his wrath, which he calls justice, bids-- \n
His wrath, which one day will destroy ye both!" \n
She spake, and at her words the hellish Pest \n
Forbore: then these to her Satan returned:-- \n
"So strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange \n
Thou interposest, that my sudden hand, \n
Prevented, spares to tell thee yet by deeds \n
What it intends, till first I know of thee \n
What thing thou art, thus double-formed, and why, \n
In this infernal vale first met, thou call'st \n
Me father, and that phantasm call'st my son. \n
I know thee not, nor ever saw till now \n
Sight more detestable than him and thee." \n
T' whom thus the Portress of Hell-gate replied:-- \n
"Hast thou forgot me, then; and do I seem \n
Now in thine eye so foul?--once deemed so fair \n
In Heaven, when at th' assembly, and in sight \n
Of all the Seraphim with thee combined \n
In bold conspiracy against Heaven's King, \n
All on a sudden miserable pain \n
Surprised thee, dim thine eyes and dizzy swum \n
In darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast \n
Threw forth, till on the left side opening wide, \n
Likest to thee in shape and countenance bright, \n
Then shining heavenly fair, a goddess armed, \n
Out of thy head I sprung. Amazement seized \n
All th' host of Heaven; back they recoiled afraid \n
At first, and called me Sin, and for a sign \n
Portentous held me; but, familiar grown, \n
I pleased, and with attractive graces won \n
The most averse--thee chiefly, who, full oft \n
Thyself in me thy perfect image viewing, \n
Becam'st enamoured; and such joy thou took'st \n
With me in secret that my womb conceived \n
A growing burden. Meanwhile war arose, \n
And fields were fought in Heaven: wherein remained \n
(For what could else?) to our Almighty Foe \n
Clear victory; to our part loss and rout \n
Through all the Empyrean. Down they fell, \n
Driven headlong from the pitch of Heaven, down \n
Into this Deep; and in the general fall \n
I also: at which time this powerful key \n
Into my hands was given, with charge to keep \n
These gates for ever shut, which none can pass \n
Without my opening. Pensive here I sat \n
Alone; but long I sat not, till my womb, \n
Pregnant by thee, and now excessive grown, \n
Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes. \n
At last this odious offspring whom thou seest, \n
Thine own begotten, breaking violent way, \n
Tore through my entrails, that, with fear and pain \n
Distorted, all my nether shape thus grew \n
Transformed: but he my inbred enemy \n
Forth issued, brandishing his fatal dart, \n
Made to destroy. I fled, and cried out Death! \n
Hell trembled at the hideous name, and sighed \n
From all her caves, and back resounded Death! \n
I fled; but he pursued (though more, it seems, \n
Inflamed with lust than rage), and, swifter far, \n
Me overtook, his mother, all dismayed, \n
And, in embraces forcible and foul \n
Engendering with me, of that rape begot \n
These yelling monsters, that with ceaseless cry \n
Surround me, as thou saw'st--hourly conceived \n
And hourly born, with sorrow infinite \n
To me; for, when they list, into the womb \n
That bred them they return, and howl, and gnaw \n
My bowels, their repast; then, bursting forth \n
Afresh, with conscious terrors vex me round, \n
That rest or intermission none I find. \n
Before mine eyes in opposition sits \n
Grim Death, my son and foe, who set them on, \n
And me, his parent, would full soon devour \n
For want of other prey, but that he knows \n
His end with mine involved, and knows that I \n
Should prove a bitter morsel, and his bane, \n
Whenever that shall be: so Fate pronounced. \n
But thou, O father, I forewarn thee, shun \n
His deadly arrow; neither vainly hope \n
To be invulnerable in those bright arms, \n
Through tempered heavenly; for that mortal dint, \n
Save he who reigns above, none can resist." \n
She finished; and the subtle Fiend his lore \n
Soon learned, now milder, and thus answered smooth:-- \n
"Dear daughter--since thou claim'st me for thy sire, \n
And my fair son here show'st me, the dear pledge \n
Of dalliance had with thee in Heaven, and joys \n
Then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change \n
Befallen us unforeseen, unthought-of--know, \n
I come no enemy, but to set free \n
From out this dark and dismal house of pain \n
Both him and thee, and all the heavenly host \n
Of Spirits that, in our just pretences armed, \n
Fell with us from on high. From them I go \n
This uncouth errand sole, and one for all \n
Myself expose, with lonely steps to tread \n
Th' unfounded Deep, and through the void immense \n
To search, with wandering quest, a place foretold \n
Should be--and, by concurring signs, ere now \n
Created vast and round--a place of bliss \n
In the purlieus of Heaven; and therein placed \n
A race of upstart creatures, to supply \n
Perhaps our vacant room, though more removed, \n
Lest Heaven, surcharged with potent multitude, \n
Might hap to move new broils. Be this, or aught \n
Than this more secret, now designed, I haste \n
To know; and, this once known, shall soon return, \n
And bring ye to the place where thou and Death \n
Shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen \n
Wing silently the buxom air, embalmed \n
With odours. There ye shall be fed and filled \n
Immeasurably; all things shall be your prey." \n
He ceased; for both seemed highly pleased, and Death \n
Grinned horrible a ghastly smile, to hear \n
His famine should be filled, and blessed his maw \n
Destined to that good hour. No less rejoiced \n
His mother bad, and thus bespake her sire:-- \n
"The key of this infernal Pit, by due \n
And by command of Heaven's all-powerful King, \n
I keep, by him forbidden to unlock \n
These adamantine gates; against all force \n
Death ready stands to interpose his dart, \n
Fearless to be o'ermatched by living might. \n
But what owe I to his commands above, \n
Who hates me, and hath hither thrust me down \n
Into this gloom of Tartarus profound, \n
To sit in hateful office here confined, \n
Inhabitant of Heaven and heavenly born-- \n
Here in perpetual agony and pain, \n
With terrors and with clamours compassed round \n
Of mine own brood, that on my bowels feed? \n
Thou art my father, thou my author, thou \n
My being gav'st me; whom should I obey \n
But thee? whom follow? Thou wilt bring me soon \n
To that new world of light and bliss, among \n
The gods who live at ease, where I shall reign \n
At thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems \n
Thy daughter and thy darling, without end." \n
Thus saying, from her side the fatal key, \n
Sad instrument of all our woe, she took; \n
And, towards the gate rolling her bestial train, \n
Forthwith the huge portcullis high up-drew, \n
Which, but herself, not all the Stygian Powers \n
Could once have moved; then in the key-hole turns \n
Th' intricate wards, and every bolt and bar \n
Of massy iron or solid rock with ease \n
Unfastens. On a sudden open fly, \n
With impetuous recoil and jarring sound, \n
Th' infernal doors, and on their hinges grate \n
Harsh thunder, that the lowest bottom shook \n
Of Erebus. She opened; but to shut \n
Excelled her power: the gates wide open stood, \n
That with extended wings a bannered host, \n
Under spread ensigns marching, mibht pass through \n
With horse and chariots ranked in loose array; \n
So wide they stood, and like a furnace-mouth \n
Cast forth redounding smoke and ruddy flame. \n
Before their eyes in sudden view appear \n
The secrets of the hoary Deep--a dark \n
Illimitable ocean, without bound, \n
Without dimension; where length, breadth, and height, \n
And time, and place, are lost; where eldest Night \n
And Chaos, ancestors of Nature, hold \n
Eternal anarchy, amidst the noise \n
Of endless wars, and by confusion stand. \n
For Hot, Cold, Moist, and Dry, four champions fierce, \n
Strive here for mastery, and to battle bring \n
Their embryon atoms: they around the flag \n
Of each his faction, in their several clans, \n
Light-armed or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift, or slow, \n
Swarm populous, unnumbered as the sands \n
Of Barca or Cyrene's torrid soil, \n
Levied to side with warring winds, and poise \n
Their lighter wings. To whom these most adhere \n
He rules a moment: Chaos umpire sits, \n
And by decision more embroils the fray \n
By which he reigns: next him, high arbiter, \n
Chance governs all. Into this wild Abyss, \n
The womb of Nature, and perhaps her grave, \n
Of neither sea, nor shore, nor air, nor fire, \n
But all these in their pregnant causes mixed \n
Confusedly, and which thus must ever fight, \n
Unless th' Almighty Maker them ordain \n
His dark materials to create more worlds-- \n
Into this wild Abyss the wary Fiend \n
Stood on the brink of Hell and looked a while, \n
Pondering his voyage; for no narrow frith \n
He had to cross. Nor was his ear less pealed \n
With noises loud and ruinous (to compare \n
Great things with small) than when Bellona storms \n
With all her battering engines, bent to rase \n
Some capital city; or less than if this frame \n
Of Heaven were falling, and these elements \n
In mutiny had from her axle torn \n
The steadfast Earth. At last his sail-broad vans \n
He spread for flight, and, in the surging smoke \n
Uplifted, spurns the ground; thence many a league, \n
As in a cloudy chair, ascending rides \n
Audacious; but, that seat soon failing, meets \n
A vast vacuity. All unawares, \n
Fluttering his pennons vain, plumb-down he drops \n
Ten thousand fathom deep, and to this hour \n
Down had been falling, had not, by ill chance, \n
The strong rebuff of some tumultuous cloud, \n
Instinct with fire and nitre, hurried him \n
As many miles aloft. That fury stayed-- \n
Quenched in a boggy Syrtis, neither sea, \n
Nor good dry land--nigh foundered, on he fares, \n
Treading the crude consistence, half on foot, \n
Half flying; behoves him now both oar and sail. \n
As when a gryphon through the wilderness \n
With winged course, o'er hill or moory dale, \n
Pursues the Arimaspian, who by stealth \n
Had from his wakeful custody purloined \n
The guarded gold; so eagerly the Fiend \n
O'er bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare, \n
With head, hands, wings, or feet, pursues his way, \n
And swims, or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flies. \n
At length a universal hubbub wild \n
Of stunning sounds, and voices all confused, \n
Borne through the hollow dark, assaults his ear \n
With loudest vehemence. Thither he plies \n
Undaunted, to meet there whatever Power \n
Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss \n
Might in that noise reside, of whom to ask \n
Which way the nearest coast of darkness lies \n
Bordering on light; when straight behold the throne \n
Of Chaos, and his dark pavilion spread \n
Wide on the wasteful Deep! With him enthroned \n
Sat sable-vested Night, eldest of things, \n
The consort of his reign; and by them stood \n
Orcus and Ades, and the dreaded name \n
Of Demogorgon; Rumour next, and Chance, \n
And Tumult, and Confusion, all embroiled, \n
And Discord with a thousand various mouths. \n
T' whom Satan, turning boldly, thus:--"Ye Powers \n
And Spirtis of this nethermost Abyss, \n
Chaos and ancient Night, I come no spy \n
With purpose to explore or to disturb \n
The secrets of your realm; but, by constraint \n
Wandering this darksome desert, as my way \n
Lies through your spacious empire up to light, \n
Alone and without guide, half lost, I seek, \n
What readiest path leads where your gloomy bounds \n
Confine with Heaven; or, if some other place, \n
From your dominion won, th' Ethereal King \n
Possesses lately, thither to arrive \n
I travel this profound. Direct my course: \n
Directed, no mean recompense it brings \n
To your behoof, if I that region lost, \n
All usurpation thence expelled, reduce \n
To her original darkness and your sway \n
(Which is my present journey), and once more \n
Erect the standard there of ancient Night. \n
Yours be th' advantage all, mine the revenge!" \n
Thus Satan; and him thus the Anarch old, \n
With faltering speech and visage incomposed, \n
Answered: "I know thee, stranger, who thou art-- *** \n
That mighty leading Angel, who of late \n
Made head against Heaven's King, though overthrown. \n
I saw and heard; for such a numerous host \n
Fled not in silence through the frighted Deep, \n
With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout, \n
Confusion worse confounded; and Heaven-gates \n
Poured out by millions her victorious bands, \n
Pursuing. I upon my frontiers here \n
Keep residence; if all I can will serve \n
That little which is left so to defend, \n
Encroached on still through our intestine broils \n
Weakening the sceptre of old Night: first, Hell, \n
Your dungeon, stretching far and wide beneath; \n
Now lately Heaven and Earth, another world \n
Hung o'er my realm, linked in a golden chain \n
To that side Heaven from whence your legions fell! \n
If that way be your walk, you have not far; \n
So much the nearer danger. Go, and speed; \n
Havoc, and spoil, and ruin, are my gain." \n
He ceased; and Satan stayed not to reply, \n
But, glad that now his sea should find a shore, \n
With fresh alacrity and force renewed \n
Springs upward, like a pyramid of fire, \n
Into the wild expanse, and through the shock \n
Of fighting elements, on all sides round \n
Environed, wins his way; harder beset \n
And more endangered than when Argo passed \n
Through Bosporus betwixt the justling rocks, \n
Or when Ulysses on the larboard shunned \n
Charybdis, and by th' other whirlpool steered. \n
So he with difficulty and labour hard \n
Moved on, with difficulty and labour he; \n
But, he once passed, soon after, when Man fell, \n
Strange alteration! Sin and Death amain, \n
Following his track (such was the will of Heaven) \n
Paved after him a broad and beaten way \n
Over the dark Abyss, whose boiling gulf \n
Tamely endured a bridge of wondrous length, \n
From Hell continued, reaching th' utmost orb \n
Of this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse \n
With easy intercourse pass to and fro \n
To tempt or punish mortals, except whom \n
God and good Angels guard by special grace. \n
But now at last the sacred influence \n
Of light appears, and from the walls of Heaven \n
Shoots far into the bosom of dim Night \n
A glimmering dawn. Here Nature first begins \n
Her farthest verge, and Chaos to retire, \n
As from her outmost works, a broken foe, \n
With tumult less and with less hostile din; \n
That Satan with less toil, and now with ease, \n
Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light, \n
And, like a weather-beaten vessel, holds \n
Gladly the port, though shrouds and tackle torn; \n
Or in the emptier waste, resembling air, \n
Weighs his spread wings, at leisure to behold \n
Far off th' empyreal Heaven, extended wide \n
In circuit, undetermined square or round, \n
With opal towers and battlements adorned \n
Of living sapphire, once his native seat; \n
And, fast by, hanging in a golden chain, \n
This pendent World, in bigness as a star \n
Of smallest magnitude close by the moon. \n
Thither, full fraught with mischievous revenge, \n
Accursed, and in a cursed hour, he hies. \n<|endoftext|>
lost \n
You were my friend then: now almost stranger! \n
Our friendship appeared once very glorious; \n
What happened meantime, gives me great anger; \n
Our friendship no longer remains serious. \n
Fool you were, to be misled by others, \n
Who drove a giant wedge ’midst our friendship; \n
Cut off is our friendship, which me bothers; \n
A nadir has come in our relationship. \n
What years of intimacy have been lost? \n
You’ve been foolish, very much on your part; \n
Our friendship today is just but a ghost; \n
Won’t your eyes see the true love in my heart? \n
Dear friend however, you can’t be my foe; \n
I hope that our friendship, blossoms once more! \n<|endoftext|>
lost \n
There is a pain in my heart \n
that brings tears in my eyes \n
I am sad because my love hurts me \n
My love, like a sky without clouds, \n
like a river without fishes and \n
like an ocean without waves \n
I am sad because my love left me alone \n
The stars are in the sky are not glittering \n
The moon in the sky is not sailing \n
The cool breeze is not touching me \n
I am sad because my love don't care for me \n
The truth always become lie \n
The love always become trouble \n
The understanding always become fail \n
I am sad because my love don't trust me \n
The thoughts in my mind become waste \n
The dreams in my heart cannot be fulfilled \n
The life in the world brings me an emptiness \n
I am sad because my love need me no more \n

lost \n
Some say the spot is banned; that the pillar Cross-and-Hand \n
Attests to a deed of hell; \n
But of else than of bale is the mystic tale \n
That ancient Vale-folk tell. \n
Ere Cernel's Abbey ceased hereabout there dwelt a priest, \n
(In later life sub-prior \n
Of the brotherhood there, whose bones are now bare \n
In the field that was Cernel choir). \n
One night in his cell at the foot of yon dell \n
The priest heard a frequent cry: \n
"Go, father, in haste to the cot on the waste, \n
And shrive a man waiting to die." \n
Said the priest in a shout to the caller without, \n
"The night howls, the tree-trunks bow; \n
One may barely by day track so rugged a way, \n
And can I then do so now?" \n
No further word from the dark was heard, \n
And the priest moved never a limb; \n
And he slept and dreamed; till a Visage seemed \n
To frown from Heaven at him. \n
In a sweat he arose; and the storm shrieked shrill, \n
And smote as in savage joy; \n
While High-Stoy trees twanged to Bubb-Down Hill, \n
And Bubb-Down to High-Stoy. \n
There seemed not a holy thing in hail, \n
Nor shape of light or love, \n
From the Abbey north of Blackmore Vale \n
To the Abbey south thereof. \n
Yet he plodded thence through the dark immense, \n
And with many a stumbling stride \n
Through copse and briar climbed nigh and nigher \n
To the cot and the sick man's side. \n
When he would have unslung the Vessels uphung \n
To his arm in the steep ascent, \n
He made loud moan: the Pyx was gone \n
Of the Blessed Sacrament. \n
Then in dolorous dread he beat his head: \n
"No earthly prize or pelf \n
Is the thing I've lost in tempest tossed, \n
But the Body of Christ Himself!" \n
He thought of the Visage his dream revealed, \n
And turned towards whence he came, \n
Hands groping the ground along foot-track and field, \n
And head in a heat of shame. \n
Till here on the hill, betwixt vill and vill, \n
He noted a clear straight ray \n
Stretching down from the sky to a spot hard by, \n
Which shone with the light of day. \n
And gathered around the illumined ground \n
Were common beasts and rare, \n
All kneeling at gaze, and in pause profound \n
Attent on an object there. \n
'Twas the Pyx, unharmed 'mid the circling rows \n
Of Blackmore's hairy throng, \n
Whereof were oxen, sheep, and does, \n
And hares from the brakes among; \n
And badgers grey, and conies keen, \n
And squirrels of the tree, \n
And many a member seldom seen \n
Of Nature's family. \n
The ireful winds that scoured and swept \n
Through coppice, clump, and dell, \n
Within that holy circle slept \n
Calm as in hermit's cell. \n
Then the priest bent likewise to the sod \n
And thanked the Lord of Love, \n
And Blessed Mary, Mother of God, \n
And all the saints above. \n
And turning straight with his priceless freight, \n
He reached the dying one, \n
Whose passing sprite had been stayed for the rite \n
Without which bliss hath none. \n
And when by grace the priest won place, \n
And served the Abbey well, \n
He reared this stone to mark where shone \n
That midnight miracle. \n<|endoftext|>
lost \n
I had spent the night in the watch-house -- \n
My head was the size of three -- \n
So I went and asked the chemist \n
To fix up a drink for me; \n
And he brewed it from various bottles \n
With soda and plenty of ice, \n
With something that smelt like lemon, \n
And something that seemed like spice. \n
It fell on my parching palate \n
Like the dew on a sunbaked plain, \n
And my system began to flourish \n
Like the grass in the soft spring rain; \n
It wandered throughout my being, \n
Suffusing my soul with rest, \n
And I felt as I "scoffed" that liquid \n
That life had a new-found zest. \n
I have been on the razzle-dazzle \n
Full many a time since then \n
But I never could get the chemist \n
To brew me that drink again. \n
He says he's forgotten the notion -- \n
'Twas only by chance it came -- \n
He's tried me with various liquids \n
But oh! they are not the same. \n
We have sought, but we sought it vainly, \n
That one lost drink divine; \n
We have sampled his various bottles, \n
But somehow they don't combine: \n
Yet I know when I cross the River \n
And stand on the Golden Shore \n
I shall meet with an angel chemist \n
To brew me that drink once more. \n<|endoftext|>
lost \n
Matron! the children of whose love, \n
Each to his grave, in youth have passed, \n
And now the mould is heaped above \n
The dearest and the last! \n
Bride! who dost wear the widow's veil \n
Before the wedding flowers are pale! \n
Ye deem the human heart endures \n
No deeper, bitterer grief than yours. \n
Yet there are pangs of keener wo, \n
Of which the sufferers never speak, \n
Nor to the world's cold pity show \n
The tears that scald the cheek, \n
Wrung from their eyelids by the shame \n
And guilt of those they shrink to name, \n
Whom once they loved, with cheerful will, \n
And love, though fallen and branded, still. \n
Weep, ye who sorrow for the dead, \n
Thus breaking hearts their pain relieve; \n
And graceful are the tears ye shed, \n
And honoured ye who grieve. \n
The praise of those who sleep in earth, \n
The pleasant memory of their worth, \n
The hope to meet when life is past, \n
Shall heal the tortured mind at last. \n
But ye, who for the living lost \n
That agony in secret bear, \n
Who shall with soothing words accost \n
The strength of your despair? \n
Grief for your sake is scorn for them \n
Whom ye lament and all condemn; \n
And o'er the world of spirits lies \n
A gloom from which ye turn your eyes. \n<|endoftext|>

His eyes are quickened so with grief, \n
He can watch a grass or leaf \n
Every instant grow; he can \n
Clearly through a flint wall see, \n
Or watch the startled spirit flee \n
From the throat of a dead man. \n
Across two counties he can hear \n
And catch your words before you speak. \n
The woodlouse or the maggot's weak \n
Clamour rings in his sad ear, \n
And noise so slight it would surpass \n
Credence--drinking sound of grass, \n
Worm talk, clashing jaws of moth \n
Chumbling holes in cloth; \n
The groan of ants who undertake \n
Gigantic loads for honour's sake \n
(Their sinews creak, their breath comes thin); \n
Whir of spiders when they spin, \n
And minute whispering, mumbling, sighs \n
Of idle grubs and flies. \n
This man is quickened so with grief, \n
He wanders god-like or like thief \n
Inside and out, below, above, \n
Without relief seeking lost love. \n<|endoftext|>

The tiny breeding frogs are singing in the roadside drain \n
And the magpie he pipes in the wind and the rain \n
And as shades of darkness roll across the sky \n
The foxes are barking on the hill nearby \n
In the chilly gloam of a gray Winter's day \n
The grey roos in the scrub they box as they play \n
And the calls of the birds known to some as weerloo \n
The big birds known to most as yellow tail black cockatoo, \n
A chilly evening in June ten weeks from the Spring \n
But the grey backed magpie is not shy to sing, \n
With it the gray fog carries a silent chill \n
As it slowly creeps across the old stony hill, \n
On a chilly evening not cold enough to snow \n
Harsh is the caw of the dark homing crow. \n<|endoftext|>

When June comes dancing o'er the death of May, \n
With scarlet roses tinting her green breast, \n
And mating thrushes ushering in her day, \n
And Earth on tiptoe for her golden guest, \n
I always see the evening when we met-- \n
The first of June baptized in tender rain-- \n
And walked home through the wide streets, gleaming wet, \n
Arms locked, our warm flesh pulsing with love's pain. \n
I always see the cheerful little room, \n
And in the corner, fresh and white, the bed, \n
Sweet scented with a delicate perfume, \n
Wherein for one night only we were wed; \n
Where in the starlit stillness we lay mute, \n
And heard the whispering showers all night long, \n
And your brown burning body was a lute \n
Whereon my passion played his fevered song. \n
When June comes dancing o'er the death of May, \n
With scarlet roses staining her fair feet, \n
My soul takes leave of me to sing all day \n
A love so fugitive and so complete. \n<|endoftext|>

Today there is a gentleness tiding \n
Its way quietly into the bay, June \n
Beach is strewn with visitor-white, trying \n
To bake brown. Cottonwool clouds will quite soon \n
In sea mist, try hiding the morning sun \n
Which is now climbing my half-shady shape \n
In surprising quick time. I have begun \n
Distracting myself from shushing-foam wake \n
Behind lullaby wavelets, replacing \n
Their crooning as sound from family droves \n
Drowns out all else. Lunch boxes are spaced \n
And runaway toddlers caught, then talk honed \n
Into quiet for munching. Shsh! ! breakers come \n
Once again, whispering their own ocean fun. \n<|endoftext|>

The very spirit of summer breathes to-day, \n
Here where I sun me in a dreamy mood, \n
And laps the sultry leas, and seems to brood \n
Tenderly o'er those hazed hills far away. \n
The air is fragrant with the new-mown hay, \n
And drowsed with hum of myriad flies pursued \n
By twittering martins. All yon hillside wood \n
Is drowned in sunshine till its green looks grey. \n
No scrap of cloud is in the still blue sky, \n
Vaporous with heat, from which the foreground trees \n
Stand out--each leaf cut sharp. The whetted scythe \n
Makes rustic music for me as I lie, \n
Watching the gambols of the children blythe, \n
Drinking the season's sweetness to the lees. \n<|endoftext|>

A white rose in her fingers, \n

A song that pulses, lingers. \n

The fiddle's merry chiming, \n
A smell of earth, of fresh, warm earth, \n
And honeysuckle climbing; \n
My lady near, yet far away- \n
Ah, lonely June of yesterday! \n
A big white night of velvet sky, \n
And Milky Way a-gleaming, \n
The fragrant blue smoke drifting by \n
From camp-fire brightly beaming; \n
The stillness of the Northland far- \n
God's solitudes of splendor- \n
My road a trail, my chart a star. \n
Wind, 'mong the balsams slender, \n
Sing low: O glad June of to-day, \n
My lady's near, though far away! \n<|endoftext|>

O Lord, the hope of Israel, all they that forsake \n
Thee shall be ashamed ; and they that depart from \n
Thee, shall be written in the earth, because they have \n
forsaken the Lord, the fountain of living waters. \n
Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be healed ; save me, \n
and I shall be saved, for Thou art my health, and my \n
great deliverer. \n
I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to \n
the gates of the grave ; I have deprived myself of the \n
residue of my years. \n
I said, I shall not see the Lord, even the Lord in the \n
land of the living : I shall behold man no more with \n
the inhabitants of the world. \n
O Lord ! by Thee doth man live, and from Thee is \n
the life of my spirit : therefore wilt Thou recover me, \n
and make me to live. \n
Thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the \n
pit of corruption ; for Thou hast cast all my sins \n
behind Thy back. \n
For Thy name's sake hast Thou put off thine anger ; \n
for Thy praise hast Thou refrained from me, that I \n
should not be cut off. \n
For the grave cannot praise Thee, death cannot \n
celebrate Thee : they that go down into the pit, cannot \n
hope for Thy truth. \n
The living, the living, he shall praise Thee, as I do \n
this day : the father to the children shall make known \n
Thy truth. \n
O Lord ! Thou hast been merciful, Thou hast \n
brought back my life from corruption : Thou hast \n
redeemed me from my sin. \n
They that follow after lying vanities, forsake their \n
own mercy. \n
Therefore shall Thy songs be with me, and my \n
prayer unto the God of my life. \n
I will go unto the altar of my God, unto God, the \n
joy of my youth ; and in Thy fear will I worship \n
towards Thy holy temple. \n
I will sacrifice unto Thee with the voice of thanks- \n
giving ; I will pay that which I have vowed ; sal- \n
vation is of the Lord. \n<|endoftext|>

The heat is mild this month of June \n
As I rest in shade near my home \n
While in silence, I heard a tune \n
Of a bird's song, this time of noon... \n
To me how sweet this lovely scene \n
A nature's grace, to most unseen \n
My feathered friends, true joy they bring \n
On this sunny, blithe month of spring \n
They seek and peck, and flap their wings \n
In quick glances, they eat and sing \n
They flew above, then play around \n
And hum their happy, chirping sound \n
It seems they knew, that I was there \n
As they flew near, for me to hear \n
I stood and gazed and hold my ground \n
And feel the beauty that abound \n
I think they call, each other's name \n
Maybe something about their games \n
Perhaps the food and other chores \n
Or their love mates, they can't ignore \n
But their life, was suddenly rouse \n
By a noise from a nearby house \n
They flew away, then out of sight \n
Left me enthralled, such a delight... \n
Alone again, and left behind \n
What had happened was kept in mind \n
As to what I felt, what I saw \n
In my writings, I have to show \n
To my beauty, worth lavish praise \n
Whom I love in so many ways \n

june \n
O dwellers in the stately towns, \n
What come ye out to see? \n
This common earth, this common sky, \n
This water flowing free? \n
As gayly as these kalmia flowers \n
Your door-yard blossoms spring; \n
As sweetly as these wild-wood birds \n
Your caged minstrels sing. \n
You find but common bloom and green, \n
The rippling river's rune, \n
The beauty which is everywhere \n
Beneath the skies of June; \n
The Hawkswood oaks, the storm-torn plumes \n
Of old pine-forest kings, \n
Beneath whose century-woven shade \n
Deer Island's mistress sings. \n
And here are pictured Artichoke, \n
And Curson's bowery mill; \n
And Pleasant Valley smiles between \n
The river and the hill. \n
You know full well these banks of bloom, \n
The upland's wavy line, \n
And how the sunshine tips with fire \n
The needles of the pine. \n
Yet, like some old remembered psalm, \n
Or sweet, familiar face, \n
Not less because of commonness \n
You love the day and place. \n
And not in vain in this soft air \n
Shall hard-strung nerves relax, \n
Not all in vain the o'erworn brain \n
Forego its daily tax. \n
The lust of power, the greed of gain \n
Have all the year their own; \n
The haunting demons well may let \n
Our one bright day alone. \n
Unheeded let the newsboy call, \n
Aside the ledger lay \n
The world will keep its treadmill step \n
Though we fall out to-day. \n
The truants of life's weary school, \n
Without excuse from thrift \n
We change for once the gains of toil \n
For God's unpurchased gift. \n
From ceiled rooms, from silent books, \n
From crowded car and town, \n
Dear Mother Earth, upon thy lap, \n
We lay our tired heads down. \n
Cool, summer wind, our heated brows; \n
Blue river, through the green \n
Of clustering pines, refresh the eyes \n
Which all too much have seen. \n
For us these pleasant woodland ways \n
Are thronged with memories old, \n
Have felt the grasp of friendly hands \n
And heard love's story told. \n
A sacred presence overbroods \n
The earth whereon we meet; \n
These winding forest-paths are trod \n
By more than mortal feet. \n
Old friends called from us by the voice \n
Which they alone could hear, \n
From mystery to mystery, \n
From life to life, draw near. \n
More closely for the sake of them \n
Each other's hands we press; \n
Our voices take from them a tone \n
Of deeper tenderness. \n
Our joy is theirs, their trust is ours, \n
Alike below, above, \n
Or here or there, about us fold \n
The arms of one great love! \n
We ask to-day no countersign, \n
No party names we own; \n
Unlabelled, individual, \n
We bring ourselves alone. \n
What cares the unconventioned wood \n
For pass-words of the town? \n
The sound of fashion's shibboleth \n
The laughing waters drown. \n
Here cant forgets his dreary tone, \n
And care his face forlorn; \n
The liberal air and sunshine laugh \n
The bigot's zeal to scorn. \n
From manhood's weary shoulder falls \n
His load of selfish cares; \n
And woman takes her rights as flowers \n
And brooks and birds take theirs. \n
The license of the happy woods, \n
The brook's release are ours; \n
The freedom of the unshamed wind \n
Among the glad-eyed flowers. \n
Yet here no evil thought finds place, \n
Nor foot profane comes in; \n
Our grove, like that of Samothrace, \n
Is set apart from sin. \n
We walk on holy ground; above \n
A sky more holy smiles; \n
The chant of the beatitudes \n
Swells down these leafy aisles. \n
Thanks to the gracious Providence \n
That brings us here once more; \n
For memories of the good behind \n
And hopes of good before. \n
And if, unknown to us, sweet days \n
Of June like this must come, \n
Unseen of us these laurels clothe \n
The river-banks with bloom; \n
And these green paths must soon be trod \n
By other feet than ours, \n
Full long may annual pilgrims come \n
To keep the Feast of Flowers; \n
The matron be a girl once more, \n
The bearded man a boy, \n
And we, in heaven's eternal June, \n
Be glad for earthly joy! \n<|endoftext|>
june \n
In a late June dawn \n
first a solitary bird speaks, then a pair, \n
eventually scores with their insistent \n
tunes and unvarying rhythms. A pause. \n
And the sun's light streams \n
across the green language, shines \n
its blue light over us and them. \n
Another pause... By now, I'm \n
out of bed, stumbling in the direction \n
my body knows well enough to lean. \n
I drink first the light, then the air, \n
finally clear crystal water. This is \n
the purest moment of the rest. After it \n
dissolves into the lightness of time spent, \n
I must do my best to preserve purity. \n
(But I know you are already helping, \n
which is why I feel no fear...) \n
I stand alone on my balcony, watching \n
shapes appearing in the haze hovering \n
still in these early moments. I would \n
not discount any of the common features, \n
such as feisty squirrels, song birds, \n
invisible hawks and owls, shy deer, and \n
the occasional fox, sunning himself \n
as it to scoff at the restraint of others. \n
Hopefully, this will not become a day \n
I'll need to negotiate with myself \n
for every scrap of success. I prefer \n
those days the human element is subsumed \n
in the rest of it, animal, mineral, plant \n
and God. I do not mind the need to play \n
a role with consummate skill, to convince \n
my companion animals I am still one \n
with them. But please make the whole \n
of it effortless, like a dance so well \n
rehearsed it takes no effort to excel, \n
as if this dawn in late June opened \n
on a garden greeting us, with no trace \n
of subtle serpents or forbidden fruits. \n<|endoftext|>
june \n
The birds' shrill fluting \n
Beats on the pink blind, \n
Pierces the pink blind \n
At whose edge fumble the sun's \n
Fingers till one obtrudes \n
And stirs the thick motes. \n
The room is a close box of pink warmth. \n
The minutes click. \n
A man picks across the street \n
With a metal-pointed stick. \n
Three clocks drop each twelve pennies \n
On the drom of noon. \n
The birds end. \n
A child's cry pricks the hush. \n
The wind plucks at a leaf. \n
The birds rebegin. \n

In the month of June \n
I composed a melodic tune \n
Ahead of time before the clocks struck noon \n
Later at night I waited to sing it out in full moon \n
June is the smell of sweet fresh roses \n
A beautiful rosy sixth month it exposes \n
And with the sweetness of each day \n
The sky clouds smile brightful and gay \n
Good Afternoon, My little summer butterflies \n
In June we can play where yellow meadows lie \n
We can observe little rivers flow into lagoons \n
And the mellifluent wildlife retreat into cocoons \n
And if love where to blossom it will do so quite soon \n
Because there is something about the month of June \n
As the longest daylight hours a year balloon \n
All marriage hopes are not left marooned \n
June is a beautiful month to sing \n
And listen to loud wedding bells ring \n
In this long awaited summer month \n
The mood of happiness is all June fronts \n

By the moon, I was enraptured. \n
I cried like a weeping willow, \n
reaching for the faraway stars \n
and memories beneath my pillow. \n
Like a whirlwind you came to me, \n
I weakened to words the singers croon. \n
Passion I felt, was more than real \n
Love's concerto ~ playing in June. \n
I dream a slightly different dream, \n
time goes by and I can't forget you; \n
my heart may show a thousand scars, \n
how could I believe without you? \n
Like a child you may turn away \n

June burst forth with sunshine blest \n
Buds awakening on the stem of trees \n
Life awakens like a treasure chest \n
And butterflies flutter in the breeze. \n
Cygnets follow in line astern their mother, \n
And other ducks swim along with pride \n
Ducklings bobbing in the water, one behind the other \n
In shimmering lakes and rivers country-wide. \n
Weeping willows gracefully kiss the water’s edge \n
Their leaves blowing gently in the wind \n
Gaggling geese chatting as they sit on the ledge \n
And the old man sitting on a bench just grinned. \n
Dog walkers with their pets strolling on the grass, \n
Mum’s with babe’s in pushchairs following on behind, \n
Joggers running round and round trying hard to pass. \n
All enjoying the June sunshine away from the daily grind. \n<|endoftext|>

Gentle like blues \n

Arms open to hug the rain \n

.Violet In June \n
A violet caught I in repose \n
Upon a sunbathed bank. \n
Her head was bowed. Do you suppose \n
It was from life she shrank? \n
She seemed so wilted in despair; \n
No tear was in her eye. \n
She languished in the torrid air \n
And seemed resigned to die. \n
Oh little violet, you have bloomed \n
When others fail the task; \n
Amid the hardships that have loomed \n
There is no more we ask. \n
Although a breeze of furnace heat \n
Has robbed you of your tear, \n
Your destiny is not complete, \n
Put off your shrinking fear. \n
Oh little violet, lift your eyes \n
Above the world, up to the sun; \n
Fear not, for when the daylight dies \n
Another dew will come. \n<|endoftext|>
wedding \n
Come up the broad river, the Thames, my Dane, \n
My Dane with the beautiful eyes! \n
Thousands and thousands await thee full fain, \n
And talk of the wind and the skies. \n
Fear not from folk and from country to part, \n
O, I swear it is wisely done: \n
For (I said) I will bear me by thee, sweetheart, \n
As becometh my father's son. \n
Great London was shouting as I went down. \n
'She is worthy,' I said, 'of this; \n
What shall I give who have promised a crown? \n
O, first I will give her a kiss.' \n
So I kissed her and brought her, my Dane, my Dane, \n
Through the waving wonderful crowd: \n
Thousands and thousands, they shouted amain, \n
Like mighty thunders and loud. \n
And they said, 'He is young, the lad we love, \n
The heir of the Isles is young: \n
How we deem of his mother, and one gone above, \n
Can neither be said nor sung. \n
He brings us a pledge—he will do his part \n
With the best of his race and name;'— \n
And I will, for I look to live, sweetheart, \n
As may suit with my mother's fame. \n<|endoftext|>
wedding \n
The time has not come before \n
And this is new. \n
The light is opening for the day \n
An ingénue displaying her bosom \n
To man’s face- \n
I remember when \n
I was young in following her. \n
Her tassels feeling through the trees \n
And drinking roots, \n
She laughed even while \n
Alone; \n
Giggling, \n
She rode her bicycle across campus. \n
I staid up all night and prayed for her. \n
When tired, she slept \n
In the shade of a house- \n
Eyes half closed. I came to her, \n
She yawned and turned me away. \n
She said she loved me \n
Only when she was drunk, \n
And it was yet that time- \n
So long ago, yesterday.... \n
Then early this morning she came to me \n
And offered me the quaff \n
Of lips. \n
Dripping nectar on the limbs, \n
She said, “Never before now, old man, ” \n
As they lowered me in the grave, \n
Her light budded \n
A valleyide of rubrum, \n
A wedding at my funeral. \n<|endoftext|>
wedding \n
She opened her eyes and dawn \n
Entered her mind, falling \n
Into her heart it sparkled \n
With rose-petal joy, imparting \n
A light to her thoughts. Today \n
She was to be wed, shaky \n
She rose and looked around \n
At the brightening room proudly. \n
Wedding gown hung dreamily \n
And appeared very unreal. \n
Cream lace, studded with roses \n
And pearls, it shone, imposing \n
A tender glow to her soul. \n
This day she would be wholly \n
His, and the image gave blush \n
To her cheeks, - then a crushing \n
Thought filled her with painful \n
Foreboding - - - he would again \n
Be away to war before \n
The day was done. With awful \n
Blight on wedded bliss, fear crept \n
Over her heart, and she wept. \n<|endoftext|>

Each strips his own skin \n
Each bares his own constellation \n
Which has never seen the night \n
Each fills his skin with rocks \n
And plays with it \n

Who doesn't stop till dawn \n
Who doesn't bat an eyelid or fall \n
Earns his own skin \n

wedding \n
The sky is torn across \n
This ragged anniversary of two \n
Who moved for three years in tune \n
Down the long walks of their vows. \n
Now their love lies a loss \n
And Love and his patients roar on a chain; \n
From every tune or crater \n
Carrying cloud, Death strikes their house. \n
Too late in the wrong rain \n
They come together whom their love parted: \n
The windows pour into their heart \n
And the doors burn in their brain. \n<|endoftext|>
wedding \n
Why have such scores of lovely, gifted girls \n
Married impossible men? \n
Simple self-sacrifice may be ruled out, \n
And missionary endeavour, nine times out of ten. \n
Repeat 'impossible men': not merely rustic, \n
Foul-tempered or depraved \n
(Dramatic foils chosen to show the world \n
How well women behave, and always have behaved). \n
Impossible men: idle, illiterate, \n
Self-pitying, dirty, sly, \n
For whose appearance even in City parks \n
Excuses must be made to casual passers-by. \n
Has God's supply of tolerable husbands \n
Fallen, in fact, so low? \n
Or do I always over-value woman \n
At the expense of man? \n
Do I? \n
It might be so. \n<|endoftext|>
wedding \n
One said, its a secret \n
So don't say to anyone \n
Said, she is marrying \n
That she is, my love \n
The one, don't knew it \n
Heart stopped for second \n
And started to pain badly \n
My throat too had felt it \n
But my lips had smiled \n
And said, its good news \n
The one said me date \n
And told me to come \n
By then heart was broken \n
But my lips still smiled \n
Said, wish i can do so \n
The one started to say \n
About my loves only love \n
So my ears were on job \n
And lips carried the talk \n
But rest of me had died \n
The one told me all \n
About my loves love \n
Then my dead heart felt \n
My loves love is better \n
Far far better than me \n
So I wiped my eyes \n
Said bye to the one \n
And placed hand on heart \n
Said, its time to sing \n
For my only loves wedding \n
Wedding, which i can't go \n
My broken heart is weak \n
It can't break down more \n
But its each broken piece \n
Sings a happy marry life \n
Forever to my loves wedding \n<|endoftext|>
wedding \n
O will ye hear a mirthful bourd? \n
Or will ye hear of courtesie? \n
Or will ye hear how a gallant lord \n
Was wedded to a gay ladye? \n
'Ca' out the kye,' quo' the village herd, \n
As he stood on the knowe, \n
'Ca' this ane's nine and that ane's ten, \n
And bauld Lord William's cow.'- \n
'I swear by the light of the Michaelmas moon, \n
And the might of Mary high, \n
And by the edge of my braidsword brown. \n
They shall soon say Harden's kye.' \n
He took a bugle frae his side, \n
With names carved o'er and o'er - \n
Full many a chief of meikle pride \n
That Border bugle bore- \n
He blew a note baith sharp and hie, \n
Till rock and water rang around- \n
Three score of moss-troopers and three \n
Have mounted at that bugle sound. \n
The Michaelmas moon had enter'd then, \n
And ere she wan the full, \n
Ye might see by her light in Harden glen \n
A bow o' kye and a bassen'd bull. \n
And loud and loud in Harden tower \n
The quaigh gaed round wi' meikle glee; \n
For the English beef was brought in bower \n
And the English ale flow'd merrilie. \n
And mony a guest from Teviotside \n
And Yarrow's Braes was there; \n
Was never a lord in Scotland wide \n
That made more dainty fare. \n
They ate, they laugh'd, they sang and quaff'd, \n
Till nought on board was seen, \n
When knight and squire were boune to dine, \n
But a spur of silver sheen. \n
Lord William has ta'en his berry brown steed- \n
A sore shent man was he; \n
'Wait he, my guests, a little speed- \n
Weel feasted ye shall be.' \n
He rode him down by Falsehope burn, \n
His cousin dear to see, \n
With him to take a riding turn- \n
Wat-draw-the-sword was he. \n
And when he came to Falsehope glen, \n
Beneath the trysting-tree, \n
On the smooth green was carved plain, \n
'To Lochwood bound are we.' \n
'O if they be gane to dark Lochwood \n
To drive the Warden's gear, \n
Betwixt our names, I ween, there's feud; \n
I'll go and have my share: \n
'For little reck I for Johnstone's feud, \n
The Warden though he be.' \n
So Lord William is away to dark Lochwood, \n
With riders barely three. \n
The Warden's daughters in Lochwood sate, \n
Were all both fair and gay, \n
All save the Lady Margaret, \n
And she was wan and wae. \n
The sister, Jean, had a full fair skin, \n
And Grace was bauld and braw; \n
But the leal-fast heart her breast within \n
It weel was worth them a'. \n
Her father's pranked her sisters twa \n
With meikle joy and pride; \n
But Margaret maun seek Dundrennan's wa'- \n
She ne'er can be a bride. \n
On spear and casque by gallants gent \n
Her sisters' scarfs were borne, \n
But never at tilt or tournament \n
Were Margaret's colours worn. \n
Her sisters rode to Thirlstane bower, \n
But she was left at hame \n
To wander round the gloomy tower, \n
And sigh young Harden's name. \n
'Of all the knights, the knight most fair, \n
From Yarrow to the Tyne,' \n
Soft sigh'd the maid, 'is Harden's heir, \n
But ne'er can he be mine; \n
'Of all the maids, the foulest maid \n
From Teviot to the Dee, \n
Ah!' sighing sad, that lady said, \n
'Can ne'er young Harden's be.'- \n
She looked up the briery glen, \n
And up the mossy brae, \n
And she saw a score of her father's men \n
Yclad in the Johnstone grey. \n
O fast and fast they downwards sped \n
The moss and briers among, \n
And in the midst the troopers led \n
A shackled knight along. \n<|endoftext|>
wedding \n
It finally snapped! \n
It had become tighter \n
over the years. \n
He pretended he didn’t notice \n
that his finger was growing \n
around the ring. \n
He assured me it didn’t hurt, \n
claimed his finger was always \n
that shade of purple, \n
but yesterday it was stretched \n
beyond it’s limits \n
and it just snapped. \n
He was pushing a shopping cart \n
(of all things!) \n
buying the needed supplies \n
to cook me a special dinner. \n
He stood there \n
like a deer caught in the headlights \n
not sure what to do. \n
Does this say something \n
about our marriage? \n
Did he really think our love \n
was dependant on a ring? \n
I grabbed his hand and looked \n
where the ring had been. \n
That finger looked so painful \n
the ring had actually left \n
a permanent imprint \n
as if his finger was made \n
of play dough. \n
I couldn’t help but wonder \n
if that is how our marriage has felt to him. \n
Confining, painful and restrictive……… \n
I will buy him a new ring, \n
One that allows his finger room \n
To breathe and move freely \n
just as I want him to feel \n
in this marriage. \n<|endoftext|>

Any room containing you. \n
In fact I care not where you be, \n
Just as long as it's with me. \n
In all your absences I glimpse \n
Fire and flood and trolls and imps. \n
Is your train a minute slothful? \n
I goad the stationmaster wrothful. \n

And when you linger late in shops \n
I long to telephone the cops. \n
Yet how worth the waiting for, \n
To see you coming through the door. \n
Somehow, I can be complacent \n
Never but with you adjacent. \n
Near and far, near and far, \n
I am happy where you are; \n
Likewise I have never larnt \n
How to be it where you aren't. \n

The thought of Chandramathi \n
Kept Harichandran’s mind busy. \n
He hated the slow moving night, \n
And the vexing moon light. \n
For the sake of Harichandran, \n
Cocks crowed early morn \n
Inviting the rising sun, \n
To come out very soon. \n
The night moon had gone, \n
With the arrival of the sun, \n
That began its open session, \n
In the morning reddish sky then. \n
From their homely nests \n
Flew out all hungry birds \n
In search of their foods, \n
From the city and woods. \n
After his bath in the river, \n
And his morning prayer, \n
King Harichandran went \n
To places in his chariot. \n
It was a pleasant sight, \n
To see wherever he went, \n
Like waterfalls, gardens, \n
Streams and mountains. \n
After days of travel \n
Crossing every hurdle \n
He reached the destination \n
In time for the function. \n
The hermits first led him \n
To Kannoj Kingdom \n
And then to the City \n
Of Kannamapuri \n
They said, “This is the place \n
Where Chandramathi lives. \n
It is here we saw her father \n
And discussed your matter.” \n
Into the City when he came, \n
Happy Harichandran became. \n
The guest house, he reached, \n
Where all the kings stayed. \n
Chandradayan gave him \n
A pleasing warm welcome. \n
All eyes looked at him \n
For his beauty and charm. \n
After what he has seen \n
Chandradayan was keen \n
That King Harichandran \n
Would be a good selection. \n
Close maids of Chandramathi \n
Briefed her about his beauty. \n
After hearing about him, \n
She fell in love with him. \n
In the main assembly hall \n
Kings were seated well. \n
There, she was led \n
By her close maid. \n
Her gorgeous bridal dress, \n
Enhanced her beautiful face, \n
That highly did impress \n
All the assembled Kings. \n
One of her maids followed, \n
King after king, she introduced, \n
But her eyes were looking for \n
Harichandran, her dream lover. \n
At last, when the turn came, \n
On hearing Harichandran’s name, \n
She saw him very closely, \n
Who looked so lovely. \n
“Is she a married woman? ” \n
Asked King Harichandran, \n
After seeing the nuptial thali \n
Tied around her neck closely. \n
Chandradayan heard this, \n
And explained him the cause, \n
That it was Shiva’s boon, \n
What he had actually seen. \n
Chandramathi was worried \n
And threw the garland \n
That straight went and fell \n
On Harichandran’s neck well. \n
Other kings felt unhappy, \n
While he was too happy \n
To receive her garland \n
From her lovely hand. \n
The wedding followed \n
And they got married. \n
It was a lovely first night, \n
Happily they both spent. \n
It was time for them \n
To leave Kannoj Kingdom, \n
From there, they all came \n
Back to Ayodhya Kingdom. \n
Chandramathi conceived. \n
In due course she delivered \n
A cute handsome boy \n
To their boundless joy. \n
They named him Devadasan, \n
And till he reached seven, \n
They both lived happily, \n
Free from any worry. \n<|endoftext|>

THERE falls with every wedding chime \n
A feather from the wing of Time. \n

Unheeded; not one word you say. \n
When bright and dusky are blown past, \n

wedding \n
Janaka, the King of Mithila, \n
A close friend of Dasaratha. \n
In a sowing ceremony held, \n
Ploughed a chosen field. \n
He saw amidst a nearby shrub, \n
A new born beautiful female babe, \n
And took her, as a father childless, \n
A gift from Mother Earth priceless! \n
To the palace, he brought her. \n
Sita, the lovely, he named her, \n
Adopted as his own daughter, \n
Proud of being her lucky father. \n
When she reached the proper age, \n
Almost ready for her marriage, \n
Janaka searched for an alliance, \n
Of the most suitable lovely prince. \n
He arranged for a competition. \n
To eligible princes sent a notification, \n
That her hand was for a worthy prince, \n
Who stringed the Shiva's bow once. \n
Princes of all the countries \n
Came and gave their tries, \n
But miserably failed to lift, \n
Bend or even slightly move it. \n
This brought worry to Janaka, \n
While the Sage Viswamitra, \n
Along with Lakshman and Rama, \n
Was nearing the city, Mithila, \n
On the way, an Ashram they saw \n
Of the revered Sage Gautama, \n
But none there was to be seen, \n
The Sage told them the reason. \n
Indra fell in love with Ahalya, \n
And in disguise as Gautama, \n
He had an undesirable union, \n
That she could have forsaken. \n
Indra tried to run away, \n
But the sage on the way, \n
Thro’ his inner eye view \n
What happened, he knew. \n
As a Gautama’s curse for his act, \n
His manhood total, he had lost, \n
And for the crying-pleading wife, \n
She had to live an invisible life. \n
He told that she be freed, \n
Back her visible life restored, \n
When the blessed feet of Ram \n
Touched the floor of the Ashram. \n
When Ram entered the site, \n
Ahalya appeared in their sight, \n
Gautama, by then, came there. \n
As a purified wife, he took her. \n
On their onward journey, \n
Towards the city roadway, \n
They went ahead slowly, \n
For the Royal ceremony. \n
King Janaka’s joy knew no bound, \n
At the sight of the lads he found. \n
He was so happy to give them \n
Both a hearty warm welcome. \n
At the king's humble request, \n
And at the Sage’s behest, \n
Ram bent, with ease, the divine bow, \n
But, just it broke into two. \n
Janaka offered the hand of Sita, \n
As a trophy for the winner Rama! \n
Dasaratha soon joined them, \n
For their marriage to perform. \n
What a pomp and show it was, \n
Beyond one’s description and guess? \n
Thus ended the Holy wedding of Sita-Ram, \n
With people hailing “Jai Janaki Ram! ” \n
It was the design of the Heaven, \n
That Goddess Lakshmi be born \n
As Sita to marry Rama incarnation \n
Of God Vishnu, in this Holy mission. \n
Even today, there goes a belief, \n
That a Hindu unmarried gets a relief, \n
Once he or she reads this in Ram’s life, \n
Gets married soon as husband and wife. \n

YOU stood beside the flowers, \n
Yourself a flower; \n
And on your face \n
The twilight stayed another hour, \n
It shone so pale; \n
And all around men talked as in a market-place. \n
I heard them talk, and felt \n
No interest stir \n
In what they said. \n
Lilies were nigh you, and around you were \n
The lights of love, \n
And all about the world moved on with nervous tread. \n
I heard it not; for down \n
And round about \n
My soul you drew \n
The veils that shut the loud earth out, \n
And I and you \n
Were there alone — no one beside but I and you! \n
What words were those we said? \n
Old ones, perchance, \n
Pale with the pain \n
Of all who've kissed, and talked romance, \n
And said farewell, \n
And mixed their tears and kissed, and sighed — and sighed in vain. \n
We stood a sainted while, \n
And then your hand \n
Sought to be free, \n
And you were gone; and all the land \n
Was under gloom, \n
And lamps were lit for other men, but none for me. \n
I stood and watched you go, \n
And suddenly \n
The loud world grew \n
Like some great-voiced, insetting sea; \n
And men went by, \n
Talking of trade and war and all but love and you. \n<|endoftext|>

The era of romance, its beginning. \n
Dice used by the players was startling \n
In the game of numbers on chess board \n
To tilt the power house and it's record. \n
Hottest commodity than gem or platinum \n
Turncoats were costliest in the millenium. \n
A keep of treachery had become wisdom \n
Criminalization of politics was in blossum. \n
Ethics, morality became out of fashion, \n
New tricks were evolved by imagination. \n
Merit and efficiency were then displaced. \n
Money and muscle power to them replaced. \n
No one can fool all for all the times, \n
Players had forgotten this truth supreme. \n

'That I may prove the bravest knight, and love the fairest fair.' \n
His oath of honour on the shrine he graved it with his sword, \n
And followed to the Holy Land the banner of his Lord; \n
Where, faithful to his noble vow, his war-cry filled the air, \n
'Be honoured aye the bravest knight, beloved the fairest fair.' \n
They owed the conquest to his arm, and then his Liegeâ€“Lord said, \n
'The heart that has for honour beat by bliss must be repaid.-â€” \n
My daughter Isabel and thou shall be a wedded pair, \n
For thou art bravest of the brave, she fairest of the fair.' \n
And then they bound the holy knot before Saint Mary's shrine, \n

A shot at romance \n
She was only ever ‘that girl’, \n
The one who always awoke instantly from the sound of: \n
An angry door slamming, \n
A single tear hitting the cold floor, \n
And a razor blade being dismantled from its safe covering. \n
But when she was with him- \n
With his arms of steal padlocked around her, \n
Not even the sound of his heartbeat awoke her, \n
Instead it soothed and rocked her to sleep, \n
Their two fragmented hearts beating so close, \n
But they never got a chance to beat to \n
Beat as one. \n
Emma Jane Pearson \n
It appears that this girl is in love, I think this is too wonderful for some With his arms of steal padlocked around her, \n
Not even the sound of his heartbeat awoke her, \n
Instead it soothed and rocked her to sleep -, asked me to think of the poetry of Rabindranath Tagore - Rabindranath Tagore poetry that is a distant man to propose to a girl, but girl hiding in a Window closed behind, not the views of this man, but that men no longer appear in the girl's side, this girl very much miss the man, usually sitting on the window edge, once again look forward to the arrival of men on TV drama, \n
If this poem of the man who can no longer see the girl now, this girl will find themselves has been the biggest loss of life, \n
Poetry in my opinion this girl is not because of money and other external factors have my love, is one of the world heavy on sweet things to comfort the people of the beauty, \n
My irony in a story on some woman in this world willing to speak with the Devil would not treasure marriage, \n
Indeed, the true feelings and the feelings of real importance, as well as women and men through the feelings of the true, spiritual love combined are the foundation of the world, \n
Did not put the spirit of the people linked to the feelings of life linked to magma, such as water and fish together, this world is the terrible cold Forever hell \n
It seems that this girl rectifies above first love, my feel like this one paragraph of What a match With his arms of steal padlocked around her, Not even the sound of his heartbeat awoke her, Instead it soothed and rocked her to sleep- - - - -, let me remember that poetry and song of Rabindranath Tagore's poetry and song- - Rabindranath Tagore is that the girl makes a proposal to one during the past a distance male person, this girl takes shelter from but behind the window being closing, reluctant idea this male person, That male person will have no the turn up time by this girl anymore but, this girl misses that male person very much, often sit by the window, be expecting that male person's once again arrival, Suppose male person in this poem will no longer appear by the girl, this girl maximal loss that can discover self having met with life, That I think that girl in this poetry and song is not love because of money and my other external factor comes into being, is beautiful conciliative heavy sweet in the world popular feeling object, My money and jewels which can not speak satirizing this some in the world women in being ready to follow a devil in a story gets married, Reliable, true affection and face to face true affection take seriously, the woman and the man pass real sentiments, the spirit feels attached to union each other and, basis being this world, People is not contacted together spirit affection magma is in life connection together, water and fish are in an image this world is forever chill terrifying hell together, \n
Evidently, this girl is occupying in the first love, I thought this section of too splendid With his arms of steal padlocked around her, Not even the sound of his heartbeat awoke her, Instead it soothed and rocked her to sleep-, is called me to remember Tagore's poetry-Tagore's that poetry is a distant place man comes to a girl to propose, but this girl hides in is closing behind the window, is not willing to see this man, but that man has not appeared again in time this girl's side, this girl thinks of that man, sits frequently nearby the window, is anticipating that man's arrival once more, If in this poem's man does not appear again side the girl, this girl will discover that she has encountered the life biggest loss, I think in this poetry the girl is not because the money and my other external factors produce love, is in the world the serious happy comfort will of the people beautiful thing, I satirize in this world in a story some women to be willing the valuables and money marriage which will speak with the devil, Truly, the real sentiment and takes seriously the real sentiment, as well as the woman and the man through the real sentiment, the spirit loves one another the union, is this world foundation, The people have not contacted with in the together energetic sentiment the rock magma the life relates in together, looks like Shui Heyu in the same place, this world is forever the cold fearful hell, \n
看 样 子 ， 这 个 姑 娘 正 处 在 初 恋 中 ， 我 觉 得 这 一 段 太 精 彩 了 With his arms of steal padlocked around her, \n

The stiff wind left \n

where is your bitter girl? \n
How many times she waited for you! \n
How many times would she wait for you, \n
cool face, black hair, \n

green flesh, her hair green, \n
with eyes of cold silver. \n
An icicle of moon \n
holds her up above the water. \n
The night became intimate \n

and pray there's no detection. \n
Blindly followed leadership, \n
if you can call it that, \n
beg for more, demanding more, \n
... and threaten through their party hats! \n
They view the people as an evil, \n
to maintain a ' cushy ' circumstance, \n
their employers are annoying, \n
and so they lie to us with political romance. \n
I am truly scared for him, \n
because an educated black man, \n
is still the biggest fear of far too many, \n
that refuse to understand. \n
I've heard it said that there are none so blind, \n
as those that will not see, \n
that cut off their nose to spite their face, \n
and somehow think that makes them pretty. \n
It only takes one idiot, \n
and one finger on a trigger, \n
to end the dreams of millions, \n
by killing one smart... dreamer! \n
I'm not sure that I'll vote for him, \n
his experience, an issue, \n
his intellegence is not in question, \n
but, will his motives be diffused? \n
This feels like the time to me, \n
to ask for one more dance, \n
and hope the partner understands, \n
- - - more than political romance! \n

Walked around with an air of true \n

BOOK I \n
A thing of beauty is a joy for ever: \n
Its loveliness increases; it will never \n
Pass into nothingness; but still will keep \n
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep \n
Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing. \n
Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing \n
A flowery band to bind us to the earth, \n
Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth \n
Of noble natures, of the gloomy days, \n
Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkened ways \n
Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all, \n
Some shape of beauty moves away the pall \n
From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon, \n
Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon \n
For simple sheep; and such are daffodils \n
With the green world they live in; and clear rills \n
That for themselves a cooling covert make \n
'Gainst the hot season; the mid forest brake, \n
Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms: \n
And such too is the grandeur of the dooms \n
We have imagined for the mighty dead; \n
All lovely tales that we have heard or read: \n
An endless fountain of immortal drink, \n
Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink. \n
Nor do we merely feel these essences \n
For one short hour; no, even as the trees \n
That whisper round a temple become soon \n
Dear as the temple's self, so does the moon, \n
The passion poesy, glories infinite, \n
Haunt us till they become a cheering light \n
Unto our souls, and bound to us so fast, \n
That, whether there be shine, or gloom o'ercast; \n
They always must be with us, or we die. \n
Therefore, 'tis with full happiness that I \n
Will trace the story of Endymion. \n
The very music of the name has gone \n
Into my being, and each pleasant scene \n
Is growing fresh before me as the green \n
Of our own valleys: so I will begin \n
Now while I cannot hear the city's din; \n
Now while the early budders are just new, \n
And run in mazes of the youngest hue \n
About old forests; while the willow trails \n
Its delicate amber; and the dairy pails \n
Bring home increase of milk. And, as the year \n
Grows lush in juicy stalks, I'll smoothly steer \n
My little boat, for many quiet hours, \n
With streams that deepen freshly into bowers. \n
Many and many a verse I hope to write, \n
Before the daisies, vermeil rimm'd and white, \n
Hide in deep herbage; and ere yet the bees \n
Hum about globes of clover and sweet peas, \n
I must be near the middle of my story. \n
O may no wintry season, bare and hoary, \n
See it half finish'd: but let Autumn bold, \n
With universal tinge of sober gold, \n
Be all about me when I make an end. \n
And now, at once adventuresome, I send \n
My herald thought into a wilderness: \n
There let its trumpet blow, and quickly dress \n
My uncertain path with green, that I may speed \n
Easily onward, thorough flowers and weed.... \n<|endoftext|>

I'll not be round to broom the hearth, \n
To feed the chicks; \n
And in the wee room of your birth \n

Your tiny tricks. \n

With bees will hum; \n
To cheerful you the throstle's bill \n

When you will come. \n
Bird, bee and bloom, they'll greet you all \n

Will thrill the ground \n
Your mother with her old grey shawl-- \n
Will not be round. \n<|endoftext|>

Something has gone wrong with meaning of words, \n
'Sun' and 'Son' beautiful creation of lords, \n
Both represent energy having sharpness of swords, \n
Both are crucial for survival and existence of world, \n
Son is embodiment of energy and power, \n
Darkness disappears when sun rays appear, \n
All worship Sun god and offer prayer \n
Light may appear through clouds from layer \n
Son is source of great hope and despair, \n
Damage caused may be more and beyond repair, \n
Sun renders service which we can't compare, \n
Rising daily from east and non appearance rare, \n
Parent pray for sun to have light in home, \n
Worshiping many Gods and visiting Rome \n
Hoping lamp in huts to light and shine, \n
Praying for son to almighty and divine, \n
Sun may have power with scorching heat, \n
Son may also show some kind of daring feat, \n
Each may be scoring and beating record, \n
One may prove…………………….. \n
Sun may hide face in dark night, \n
Parents may cry for son during day light, \n
Daily scuffles on with wordy fight, \n
Whom do we blame for want of light? \n
Many may be blessed with intelligent son, \n
They should always rejoice with simple reason \n
Greed may run high with aim only gain, \n
Parent should not keep that only aim \n
Many parents may not come out and openly speak, \n
Dryness and worry on face and future seems bleak, \n
Both are welcome in life and are so dear, \n
No parent may prefer bad words to hear \n
We can't afford for loss of any one \n
Fate may not be same as faced by everyone \n
The irony of fact remains almost same in nature \n
We should not blame anybody in near future \n
Is it an end of life or start of the game? \n
Do the children take on for simple fame? \n
Will situation remain for all times to come? \n
Will they not blame and refuse to welcome \n<|endoftext|>

One day he will come into the bathroom \n

'It takes the shadow off my face.' \n
'But where does the shadow come from? ' \n
As usual, he'll want the answers to everything \n

in the tone of the cold water thrown against \n
your face, in the damp towel and how you \n
consider yourself at the mirror before \n
tousling his hair and walking away \n
leaving him to write his own future in the mystery \n
of a fogged mirror or the sting of styptic pencil \n

On the night you said goodbye \n
I told God, I want you to die \n
because my heart ached \n
For your pain was real \n
and I knew your suffering \n
would never heal \n
So I laid in bed that night \n
As God had called you towards his light \n
All of my thoughts were now known \n
and the sound of the phone \n
rang out in our home \n
I ran out of my room and screamed \n
I knew what happened \n
that it wasn’t a dream \n
I watched as a grown man cried \n
for he knew also that his wife had died \n
My brother soon joined in \n
And he screamed as I just did \n
The person that brought us here \n
Was gone \n
and this was clear \n
All I knew was because of you \n
you gave us love as we both grew \n
you spent your life teaching us right \n
and we thank you mom for your tremendous fight \n
You did not want to go \n
You wanted to stay \n
and watch us grow \n
but your chosen time had come \n
We lost a mother \n
and cancer had won \n
I remember so well the last time I saw you \n
it was after school with my two friends who you knew \n
We brought you balloons and a little hippo \n
and you smiled and said hello \n
But your eyes and face did not look as they did \n
and your voice quivered \n
as your body shivered... \n
I stood at your bed with my face to the ground \n
and held your hand softly \n
without making a sound \n
how could I have known - what lied ahead \n
for all I knew - you were sick in bed \n
I was young and thought you would be fine \n
I wish I knew this would be our last time \n
Many years have passed by \n
Since you have gone - mom \n
But I know you will always be with me \n
And I shall never walk alone \n
On the night you said goodbye \n
God took your soul up high \n
away from us down here \n
to a place where there is no fear \n
but one day we will meet again \n
where the night and day never end \n
where people don't pass away \n
and words like goodbye… \n
We will never have to say…. \n<|endoftext|>

For unto us a child was born, and unto us The Son was given. \n
Through The Son I am reborn, and by His blood I am forgiven. \n
On a cross of shame and scorn, His life for all was freely given. \n
Many hearts indeed were torn, as the temple curtain was riven. \n
But that was the end of The Law, and began the Age of Grace. \n
And access was open to all, who in prayer would seek His face. \n
This was for men big and small, at any time and from any place. \n
He came to redeem from the fall, all the sinners of Adam’s race. \n
The only man, who had no sin, came into this world to be a light. \n
A world that was made by Him, and filled by men with evil blight. \n
His light in me He placed within, to guide me in the darkest night. \n
And as you faithfully follow Him, He fills you with eternal delight. \n
Christ came as God had willed, to become the Savior of all men. \n
Christ Jesus being Spirit filled, said that men must be born again. \n
But by His own, Christ was killed, as one who stood condemned. \n
However friend this only fulfilled, Christ’s set purpose for all men. \n
The reason Jesus came to earth, was to be God’s final sacrifice. \n
For short of Glory was our worth, and so The Son paid the price, \n
So from God we gain new birth, and this is through Jesus Christ. \n
And soon we will leave this earth, to begin with Him Eternal Life. \n

Here come I to my own again, \n
Fed, forgiven and known again, \n
Claimed by bone of my bone again \n
And cheered by flesh of my flesh. \n
The fatted calf is dressed for me, \n
But the husks have greater rest for me, \n
I think my pigs will be best for me, \n
So I'm off to the Yards afresh. \n
I never was very refined, you see, \n
(And it weighs on my brother's mind, you see) \n
But there's no reproach among swine, d'you see, \n
For being a bit of a swine. \n
So I'm off with wallet and staff to eat \n
The bread that is three parts chaff to wheat, \n
But glory be! - there's a laugh to it, \n
Which isn't the case when we dine. \n
My father glooms and advises me, \n
My brother sulks and despises me, \n
And Mother catechises me \n
Till I want to go out and swear. \n
And, in spite of the butler's gravity, \n
I know that the servants have it I \n
Am a monster of moral depravity, \n
And I'm damned if I think it's fair! \n
I wasted my substance, I know I did, \n
On riotous living, so I did, \n
But there's nothing on record to show I did \n
Worse than my betters have done. \n
They talk of the money I spent out there - \n
They hint at the pace that I went out there - \n
But they all forget I was sent out there \n
Alone as a rich man's son. \n
So I was a mark for plunder at once, \n
And lost my cash (can you wonder?) at once, \n
But I didn't give up and knock under at once, \n
I worked in the Yards, for a spell, \n
Where I spent my nights and my days with hogs. \n
And shared their milk and maize with hogs, \n
Till, I guess, I have learned what pays with hogs \n
And - I have that knowledge to sell! \n
So back I go to my job again, \n
Not so easy to rob again, \n
Or quite so ready to sob again \n
On any neck that's around. \n
I'm leaving, Pater. Good-bye to you! \n
God bless you, Mater! I'll write to you! \n
I wouldn't be impolite to you, \n
But, Brother, you are a hound! \n<|endoftext|>

Leaving, to catch thy plaintive soul soon gone. \n
O Negro slaves, dark purple ripened plums, \n
Squeezed, and bursting in the pine-wood air, \n
Passing, before they stripped the old tree bare \n
One plum was saved for me, one seed becomes \n

Water Water Everywhere \n
Water water everywhere and not a drop to drink \n
That is of course until this lovely ship does sink \n
There is nothing to compare to a sunrise while at sea \n
Oh how I've missed those moments special just to me \n
Sunrises on the ocean with no one else around \n
Seems to show God's near us without a single sound \n
Sunsets are special too, dull moments they are not \n
Beautiful red colors emitting hues not too soon forgot \n
Night time on the ocean brings many things anew \n
On moonless skies it seems so cold with just a hint of dew \n
Of course those starry nights are quite a sight to see \n
The beauty of those twinklers was fashioned just for me \n

THE SUN stepped down from his golden throne, \n
And lay in the silent sea, \n
And the Lily had folded her satin leaves, \n
For a sleepy thing was she; \n
What is the Lily dreaming of? \n
Why crisp the waters blue? \n
See, see, she is lifting her varnished lid! \n
Her white leaves are glistening through! \n
The Rose is cooling his burning cheek \n
In the lap of the breathless tide; — \n
The Lily hath sisters fresh and fair, \n
That would lie by the Rose's side; \n
He would love her better than all the rest, \n
And he would be fond and true; — \n
But the Lily unfolded her weary lids, \n
And looked at the sky so blue. \n
Remember, remember, thou silly one, \n
How fast will thy summer glide, \n
And wilt thou wither a virgin pale, \n
Or flourish a blooming bride? \n
'O the rose is old, and thorny, and cold, \n
And he lives on earth, ' said she; \n
'But the Star is fair and he lives in the air, \n
And he shall my bridegroom be.' \n
But what if the stormy cloud should come, \n
And ruffle the silver sea? \n
Would he turn his eye from the distant sky, \n
To smile on a thing like thee? \n
O no, fair Lily, he will not send \n
One ray from his far-off throne; \n
The winds shall blow and the waves shall flow, \n
And thou wilt be left alone. \n
There is not a leaf on the mountain-top \n
Nor a dropp of evening dew, \n
Nor a golden sand on the sparkling shore, \n
Nor a pearl in the waters blue, \n
That he has not cheered with his fickle smile, \n
And warmed with his faithless beam, — \n
And will he be true to a pallid flower, \n
That floats on the quiet stream? \n
Alas for the Lily! she would not heed, \n
But turned to the skies afar, \n
And bared her breast to the trembling ray \n
That shot from the rising star; \n
The cloud came over the darkened sky, \n
And over the waters wide: \n
She looked in vain through the beating rain, \n
And sank in the stormy tide. \n<|endoftext|>

‘To understand all \n
is to forgive all ‘ – \n
that’s one French saying \n
that doesn’t seem to have \n
crossed the few miles of \n
‘The English Channel’, or \n
the Straits of Dover or \n
‘The Sleeve’ or the \n
‘Passage of Calais’ or \n
however the French translates – \n
with the Normans; so \n
perhaps they left it behind \n
at the Conquest along with \n
Armagnac and crepes and \n
their blonde mistresses \n
and never went back for it \n
like I wonder if that blunt \n
English saying, \n
‘Those who can, do; \n
those who can’t, teach; and \n
those who can’t teach, \n
become critics…’ \n
ever made it across La Manche \n
to that civilised nation where \n
critics, teachers, and the mind \n
are held in such respect; but \n
suppose we equate football \n
and poetry here: \n
football supporters know their \n
playing days are over, if \n
they ever happened anyway; \n
they aren’t equipped to teach \n
except their sons, for some \n
happy time; and so they \n
hold to their precious love of \n
the beautiful game \n
by criticising the team, \n
the manager, and especially \n
the ref. Shoot the ref. So \n
maybe it’s because \n
you, and you know who you are, \n
felt you couldn’t be \n
the great poet which you so wanted \n
to be, and found you \n
couldn’t teach, that \n
because you truly, deeply \n
love poetry and all \n
it stands for, and need \n
to preserve that love, you \n
criticise poetry so savagely here \n
in England, and \n
are hated for it; \n
strange isn’t it that \n
a few miles across the Channel \n
from aggressive England \n
you’d be feted, revered, honoured, \n
as staunch upholder in critical essays \n
of the ever-renewing greatness of \n
French literature… \n

were delivered to our home today. \n
I didn't know who sent them \n
for on the note it didn't say. \n
It was our address, that was what I'd seen \n
but the name for whom it was sent, was for a, Mrs. Irene. \n
I read the note that was attached \n
in it read a message of friendship, love and hope. \n
'I hope you 're feeling better dear friend.' \n
this was what the senders note had wrote. \n
I told the delivery man \n
That there must be some mistake. \n
For my name is not, Mrs.Irene \n
that was the last home owner \n
so here's your flowers back, to take. \n
Mrs Irene didn't make it, that was what her husband said \n
she had battled cancer, and had fought it well. \n
But I think she sees the pink roses, maybe sent a bit too late \n
and is enjoying the sweetness of their flowers smell. \n<|endoftext|>
pink \n
Does not making you happy, with a snappier pink, \n
make you excited? Snap, snap...your lips did they...purse \n
this word, or discard it...? \n
Who would not die, to scream her oinks all there life, \n
do you fear, will these simple words, \n
, requested...now get me arrested... \n
New clean words, washed free, over and over again. \n
Do they really, sound quite like the others, in your mind..? \n
Blush me, I will blush you to death, i live for your blush. \n
your blush drowns me, in seas of pink, that make you oink. \n
Did you take all my blush? \n
Please wait, It for you, will make oceans more. \n<|endoftext|>
pink \n
Now what would you think, \n
Of a party all pink, \n
With pink iguanas, \n
Dressed in pink pyjamas? \n
Guests as big as an elephant, \n
Their size quite irrelevant, \n
As long as they've the right hue, \n
Just remember dyes are taboo. \n
Their skin must be real, \n
To join in our meal. \n
The frogs can eat slugs, \n
And all kinds of bugs, \n
Like the dragon millipede, \n
Which is dangerous indeed. \n
Would it be so shocking, \n
When flamingoes come flocking? \n
Do you think I'm shallow, \n
To eat only marshmallow? \n
We'll set you a place, \n
If you have a pink face. \n
'I think, ' said a dolphin called pinky, \n
'This is all rather stinky. \n
We may look quite bizarre, \n
But colour is not who we are. \n
Our skin is only one part, \n
Look at others hearts, \n
And get to know their minds, \n
Then you'll find, \n
That it's best to be kind. \n
Tell everyone alive, \n
They can just arrive, \n
With their own sort of jive. \n
The more different their dance, \n
The better to enhance. \n
Teach us something new, \n
Follow a different avenue. \n
What might seem strange, \n
Can help us to change. \n
A party for all, \n
Would be a ball.' \n<|endoftext|>
pink \n
Do not text me or think otherwise \n
I am just picking flowers from my garden. \n
Last evening I picked a red rose but \n
Wow! It proved to be too red for my date \n
Today I visited the same garden \n
The only flower I found was a white rose. \n
Where is my favourite pink rose? \n
This morning I cycled to the market \n
Sure, to buy my date a pink rose \n
But the only roses there were yellow and purple. \n
Tried to enquire where I could get one \n
But no one knows where to find. \n
Went to my flower vendor but nowhere to find \n
Where will I get my pink rose for my date? \n
Tomorrow, I'll travel far and wide \n
Only to get this precious pink flower \n
And if I succeed, my date will be happy \n
And my heart will find a solace rest \n
Amidst the residue of love petals \n
Just with the pink flower petals. \n
Where will I get my Pink rose flower? \n

In your folly what have you decreed \n
as the months and years advance \n
and with what treasures will you court \n
your queen in the turbulence of your act? \n
And what great victory shall you stage \n
behind the curtain of carnal pleasure \n
with incessant ship wrecks and delays \n
I still await you as you loiter at your ease. \n

pink \n
to my grandparents \n
in bubble-gum pink, reading old comics \n
we sipped our summers slowly while \n
the zinnias fried in the gardens. \n
after you are over the school nightmares \n
when you're being tested on the things you never read \n
because they weren't in the book- \n
the months are yours. \n
in seersucker dresses, white sandals everywhere \n
reading paperbacks by the score all the way from \n
Englewood Cliffs in brown paper, string, unwrapped \n
with a crackling like the crackling of words you \n
picked yourself from the garden of language. \n
or the SBS catalogue \n
and this is more delicious than ice cream: \n
Neapolitan striped chocolate, vanilla, strawberry \n
we eat quietly at the retro kitchen table \n
mushing it all together in a frothy heaven \n
while our little dog mysteriously does tricks \n
no one taught her yet hoping for just a slurp \n
perhaps, a sudden accident where the bowls slip \n
deliciously down and she wins the cracker jack prize, \n
you bet! \n
fresh peaches from Arkansas, like eating the sunrise, \n
who could describe it? \n
who wouldn't want a dress in watermelon colours, \n
cherry vanilla- it's decided. \n
chiffon maybe, with a beaded top \n
that shines like suns unnumbered. \n
it's just sequins, get over it a voice from somewhere said. \n
we squashed it like a bug. \n
eating Divinity candy, peaked like snow drifts, \n
we carry on. \n
and now we're on the back porch with sparklers \n
and it's always the fourth of july. \n
and we wear sundresses \n
while learning the scales, \n
on the piano we dust on Saturdays \n
zealously, with lemon pledge. \n
and reading the Reader's Digest we'll learn what to \n
do in emergencies, like, if you're unexpectedly \n
caught in quicksand \n
or at summer camps \n
where we are horrible at canoeing \n
and so glad to be back home \n
where the real summer is. \n
even if, we no longer drink \n
orange sodas every day from a vending machine \n
so homesick near the humid cabins. \n
and there's so much of it, still left! \n
all golden vanilla, the moon floats over it. \n
or maybe you muse, it's butter pecan \n
and it's not melted yet. \n

pink \n
When I was in Junior High \n
A term for Middle School in a time gone by \n
My Mother bought me a briefcase of pink \n
Although I loved it, I was worried what others would think \n
It gave the kids a reason to poke fun \n
Carrying a pink briefcase, I was the only one. \n
So I’d leave home briefcase in hand then hide it under a tree \n
Because I did not want the kids to make fun of me. \n
Someone tore off the handle and made me mad \n
The ruined briefcase made my Mother sad. \n
Kids still made fun of me anyway \n
As I walked to school day after day \n
I was young and weak then \n
Teenage life was hard without a friend. \n
Those days were difficult and long \n
But they built character and made me strong. \n
A life’s lesson was taught \n
By the pink briefcase my Mother bought. \n
I learned to walk in my own shoes \n
And live my life as I’d choose. \n
Many years of time have passed. \n
Is that our grandson’s girlfriend? My husband asked \n
I can’t tell, they all look and dress the same \n
The only thing different about them is their name \n
I can’t distinguish one girl from another. \n
Too bad she’d never been given a pink briefcase by her Mother! \n<|endoftext|>
pink \n
When took a dip in Ganga \n
that pink sari \n
imbibed a lot of Advaitha. \n
...glued to her skin \n
and lost identity... \n
became a mound of her mounds \n
curve of her curves \n
and dip of her dips. \n
I knew how euphoric that pinky felt \n
When dried up and separated from her \n
...retained her shape. \n<|endoftext|>

So Davies wrote: ' This leaves me in the pink. ' \n
Then scrawled his name: ' Your loving sweetheart Willie ' \n
With crosses for a hug. He'd had a drink \n
Of rum and tea; and, though the barn was chilly, \n
For once his blood ram warm; he had pay to spend, \n
Winter was passing; soon the year would mend. \n
He couldn't sleep that night. Stiff in the dark \n
He groaned and thought of Sundays at the farm, \n
When he'd go out as cheerful as a lark \n
In his best suit to wander arm-in-arm \n
With brown-eyed Gwen, and whisper in her ear \n
The simple, silly things she liked to hear. \n
And then he thought: to-morrow night we trudge \n
Up to the trenches, and my boots are rotten. \n
Five miles of stodgy clay and freezing sludge, \n
And everything but wretchedness forgotten. \n
To-night he's in the pink; but soon he'll die. \n
And still the war goes on; he don't know why. \n<|endoftext|>
pink \n
I am really shocked to behold the pink city \n
Blood when flows near by the green field \n
From the ill fatted souls of their mother’s womb \n
Tear when turns red eyes yet steeped in sorrows \n
Serial blast such brutal act against humanity \n
in this maddened world by this mankind \n
fire when burns the love in men innocent \n
peace and care when waned by evil insane \n
should we still call them homosapiens, perhaps no \n
unwanted rogues resourced by their own ill design \n
society still seems wild by the doings of paranoia \n
yet we call upon justice knocking the door of divine \n
barbarism still plays by the laughter of wickedness \n
slanting across the door of terrorism when befuddled \n
as when wrought by the minds of ill born dunderheads \n
can we not classify them in between man and killer giant \n
still they seem to be more severe and wild by the death \n
even more dangerous than wild and insane of the jungles \n
the crown when worn by the heinous world of terrorism \n
the cruelty has already infiltrated to our blood \n
yet not the last massacre of trade centre or else where \n
that has not yet been blotted out from our mind, \n
still we remember that horrific moments by the death \n
the process of annihilation when starts \n
sun may disappear from east or west \n
man when counts his age by the void in darkness \n
heart still bleats and blurs by the hope against hope \n
and we condemns this domestic terrorism by monsters \n
God might be feeling pity for those Frankenstein \n
who never think of their own grave.hanging on their heads \n
I sill remember the inch cape rock against the storm \n
Ralf the Rover when embraced the deadly death \n
I still pray God never allows these heartless worms \n
to be here again or to grow some where on this earth, \n
lest the tears may not fall again in the furrows of remorse and sorrows \n<|endoftext|>

An umbrella being dragged at the day's end. \n
A seagull churns its wings, \n

the hard flight of Icarus. \n
Pink swimsuits blown in the wind, \n

Time is needy, a bronzed babe walks by, a regular \n
statue of Liberty, her flesh turning to \n
green palor as the water cools. \n
In this empty beach dream of deepening sky, \n
the wet Kremlin and White House \n

truth \n
Written at Fourteen Years of Age. \n
Where, lovely Goddess, dost thou dwell? \n
In what remote and silent shade? \n
Within what cave or lonely cell? \n
With what old hermit, or unpractis'd maid? \n
In vain I've sought thee all around, \n
But thy unfashionable sound \n
In crowds was never heard, \n
Nor ever has thy form in town or court appear'd. \n
The sanctuary is not safe to thee, \n
Chas'd thence by endless mystery; \n
Thy own professors chase thee thence, \n
And wage eternal war with thee and sense; \n
Then in perplexing comments lost, \n
E'en when they would be thought to show the most. \n
Most beautiful when most distress'd, \n
Descend, O Goddess, to my breast; \n
There thou may'st reign, unrivall'd and alone, \n
My thoughts thy subject, and my heart thy throne. \n<|endoftext|>
truth \n
The darkness surrounds me \n
fills the void and caresses my skin \n
encouraging me to rise and sin \n
my mind turns ashen and corrupts my thoughts \n
gossiping about would be not \n
I was once revered by the sick and the old \n
now all I have left is the cold \n
The darkness engulfs me \n
In my wake I drain happy thoughts \n
Leaving morals to sit and rot \n
dealing with those who would rather not. \n
'Your a monster' they say with a mob at their side \n
alone by themselves they would run and hide \n
A wake of destruction follows me by my stride \n
lands charred black, rivers boiled \n
The hard work of man soiled \n
My rise to the top is bloody and fast \n
The public knowing my reign will not last \n
Those who oppse are often bloodied \n
I have been extensively studied \n
The darkness becomes me \n
They fear me, hate me, want to destroy me \n
All because I took away their lives that were free \n
A bullet to the head, \n
I rise from the dead \n
Proclaimed as the one \n
Deeds like mine are rarely done \n
So begins my apocalyptic reign \n

Truth be told, in days of old \n

That you will always belong to me \n

Before you go, there is one thing you should know \n

In truth, oh Love, with what a boyish kind \n
Thou doest proceed in thy most serious ways: \n
That when the heav'n to thee his best displays, \n
Yet of that best thou leav'st the best behind. \n
For like a child that some fair book doth find, \n
With gilded leaves or colored vellum plays, \n
Or at the most on some find picture stays, \n
But never heeds the fruit of writer's mind: \n
So when thou saw'st in Nature's cabinet \n
Stella, thou straight lookst babies in her eyes, \n
In her cheek's pit thou didst thy pitfall set: \n
And in her breast bopeep or couching lies, \n
Playing and shining in each outward part: \n
But, fool, seekst not to get into her heart. \n<|endoftext|>
truth \n
in vino veritas \n
so goes the phrase \n
& so t'would seem to be: \n
Mind can lie; heart cannot. \n
& when mind keeps heart \n
under lock & key \n
then wine can seem \n
a welcome thief \n
opening lock'd heart \n
letting it speak its truth. \n
Thus my quandary: \n
Because I love you \n
I long to hear those words, \n
so sweet, echo'd back to me. \n
But at its killing cost \n
a price too high \n
& one I'd never ask. \n
For your heart's true song \n
is known to me \n
& though I might wish \n
you could pick heart's lock \n
or someday your mind \n
be a willing key, \n
I'd rather have you \n
be icy cold to me \n
than cold & dead & I bereft: \n
The grave's no place for your beauty, love \n
nor for your kind & loving heart \n
You mean so much to me. \n
My curse, you see, is to love you. \n
(I have e'er since we met.) \n
& I know what your heart feels \n
though mind can never speak. \n
Which is why I've never \n
closed my own: \n
open my heart & vulnerable \n
it leaves me little choice. \n
For I can naught but love you \n
e'en with your heart's truth unvoiced. \n
& once cross'd over to other side \n
our masks & roles shall be \n
dropp'd like useless toys \n
freeing our shining spirits \n
who shall embrace & know true joy. \n
but as for now, that old saw's truth \n
must sustain me & suffice \n
as my heart alone shall sing her tune aloud \n
and I stand, Aphrodite's sacrifice. \n

I bought a dollar and a half's worth of small red potatoes, \n
took them home, boiled them in their jackets \n
and ate them for dinner with a little butter and salt. \n
Then I walked through the dried fields \n
on the edge of town. In middle June the light \n
hung on in the dark furrows at my feet, \n
and in the mountain oaks overhead the birds \n
were gathering for the night, the jays and mockers \n
squawking back and forth, the finches still darting \n
into the dusty light. The woman who sold me \n
the potatoes was from Poland; she was someone \n
out of my childhood in a pink spangled sweater and sunglasses \n
praising the perfection of all her fruits and vegetables \n
at the road-side stand and urging me to taste \n
even the pale, raw sweet corn trucked all the way, \n
she swore, from New Jersey. "Eat, eat" she said, \n
"Even if you don't I'll say you did." \n
Some things \n
you know all your life. They are so simple and true \n
they must be said without elegance, meter and rhyme, \n
they must be laid on the table beside the salt shaker, \n
the glass of water, the absence of light gathering \n
in the shadows of picture frames, they must be \n
naked and alone, they must stand for themselves. \n
My friend Henri and I arrived at this together in 1965 \n
before I went away, before he began to kill himself, \n
and the two of us to betray our love. Can you taste \n
what I'm saying? It is onions or potatoes, a pinch \n
of simple salt, the wealth of melting butter, it is obvious, \n
it stays in the back of your throat like a truth \n
you never uttered because the time was always wrong, \n
it stays there for the rest of your life, unspoken, \n
made of that dirt we call earth, the metal we call salt, \n
in a form we have no words for, and you live on it. \n<|endoftext|>

There are things \n
I will never understand. \n
The pain, the hate that \n
exists within my life. \n
There is nothing but time, \n
there is nothing real. \n
Truth is a concept, \n
no one ever sees. \n
No one ever feels it right, \n
and inside the truth \n
are only questions \n
of pain, of reality, \n
and a forgoing existence, \n
that has everyone living \n
outside the truth \n
and inside tradition, \n
opinion and thought. \n
With all being accepted now. \n
All truth changes in time… \n
“Do you remember yesterday? \n
Was last year the same? ” \n
In truth, death is reality. \n

When my love swears that she is made of truth \n
I do believe her, though I know she lies, \n
That she might think me some untutored youth, \n
Unlearnèd in the world's false subtleties. \n
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young, \n
Although she knows my days are past the best, \n
Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue; \n
On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed. \n
But wherefore says she not she is unjust? \n
And wherefore say not I that I am old? \n
O, love's best habit is in seeming trust, \n
And age in love, loves not to have years told. \n
Therefore I lie with her, and she with me, \n
And in our faults by lies we flattered be. \n<|endoftext|>

New and old still there growing, \n
Yet no one sees that part of my fairly tale life. \n

hair \n
Did I see a red hair vixen at several DSW’s? \n
A ‘canine’ with a fetish of shoes? \n
It can’t be. \n
Anyway it has; a wily fox outsmarted the bi-pedals taking their shoes. \n
I know that this fox has a German background, \n
She wasn’t a ‘desert fox’ I later found, \n
Was she related to General Rommel? \n
Anyway, to make a long story even longer, \n
This vixen cunningly stole pairs of shoes from people, \n
She could have stole them for toys, \n
-for her kits, or wear them in style. \n
Slippers, boots, and sneakers; \n
-she had taken them from various porches for awhile. \n
She tried and tried and tried, \n
To get the right shoes to fit. \n
The case was cracked when a forestry worker stumbled upon an astonishing scene in the woods: \n
-dozens of shoes lay strewn on the forest floor surrounding a fox's den. \n
Even more were discovered inside! \n
By the way, \n
'We found 86 shoes in the den and a further 32 in a nearby quarry, \n
-where they like to play.' \n
What were the clues? \n
Tiny little teeth marks on the shoelaces leads the Count to theorize that the vixen had \n
been stealing the footwear for her cubs to play with. That, or she 'simply likes \n
collecting shoes, ' say the locals. \n
And, really, who could fault a female for liking shoes? \n
Imelda Marcos had 2400 pairs in her ‘den’. \n
As far as the vixen correcting her ways. \n
Not a chance, \n
'More shoes have gone missing in the last few days.' \n

Still I don't know anymore, in the heart of those deep nights, \n
How to see you with the passion of yesterday. \n
The moon grazed you with a slanted glow ... \n

And turn me into an innocent little head louse \n
So I can crawl through the jungle of your hair \n
And sing a song of darkness in its fragrance. \n
Under your fingernail-roof Ill sleep in my house; \n
In my black dream Ill water your black trees. \n
Ill pick black fruits, and hair-jungle bees \n
Will bring me black poems to be opened. \n
How will I live, without your hair? \n
How will I breathe, without its fragrance? \n
How will I survive, when I am discovered \n
By ghosts of wooden combs combing your hair? \n
Let me wear shows made of dawn-flowers \n
And crawl without a sound into your sleep. \n
Ill take the place of the hair that's gone \n

hair \n
Through many a fragrant cedar grove \n
A darkened water moans; \n
And there pale Memory stood with Love \n
Amongst the moss-green stones. \n
The shimmering sunlight fell and kissed \n
The grasstree’s golden sheaves; \n
But we were troubled with a mist \n
Of music in the leaves. \n
One passed us, like a sudden gleam; \n
Her face was deadly fair. \n
“Oh, go,” we said, “you homeless Dream \n
Of Ella’s shining hair! \n
“We halt, like one with tired wings, \n
And we would fain forget \n
That there are tempting, maddening things \n
Too high to clutch at yet! \n
“Though seven Springs have filled the Wood \n
With pleasant hints and signs, \n
Since faltering feet went forth and stood \n
With Death amongst the pines.” \n
From point to point unwittingly \n
We wish to clamber still, \n
Till we have light enough to see \n
The summits of the hill. \n
“O do not cry, my sister dear,” \n
Said beaming Hope to Love, \n
“Though we have been so troubled here \n
The Land is calm above; \n
“Beyond the regions of the storm \n
We’ll find the golden gates, \n
Where, all the day, a radiant Form, \n
Our Ella, sits and waits.” \n
And Memory murmured: “She was one \n
Of God’s own darlings lent; \n
And Angels wept that she had gone, \n
And wondered why she went. \n
“I know they came, and talked to her, \n
Through every garden breeze, \n
About eternal Hills of Myrrh, \n
And quiet Jasper Seas. \n
“For her the Earth contained no charms; \n
All things were strange and wild; \n
And I believe a Seraph’s arms \n
Caught up the sainted Child.” \n
And Love looked round, and said: “Oh, you \n
That sit by Beulah’s streams, \n
Shake on this thirsty life the dew \n
Which brings immortal dreams! \n
“Ah! turn to us, and greet us oft \n
With looks of pitying balm, \n
And hints of heaven, in whispers soft, \n
To make our troubles calm. \n
“My Ella with the shining hair, \n
Behold, these many years, \n
We’ve held up wearied hands in prayer; \n
And groped about in tears.” \n
But Hope sings on: “Beyond the storm \n
We’ll find the golden gates \n
Where, all the day, a radiant Form, \n
Our Ella, sits and waits.” \n<|endoftext|>

hair \n
In the old days of our family, \n
My grandmother was a young woman \n
Whose hair was as long as the river. \n
She lived with her sisters on the ranch \n
La Calera--The Land of the Lime-- \n
And her days were happy. \n
But her uncle Carlos lived there too, \n
Carlos whose soul had the edge of a knife. \n
One day, to teach her to ride a horse, \n
He made her climb on the fastest one, \n
Bareback, and sit there \n
As he held its long face in his arms. \n
And then he did the unspeakable deed \n
For which he would always be remembered: \n
He called for the handsome baby Pirrín \n
And he placed the child in her arms. \n
With that picture of a Madonna on horseback \n
He slapped the shank of the horse's rear leg. \n
The horse did what a horse must, \n
Racing full toward the bright horizon. \n
But first he ran under the álamo trees \n
To rid his back of this unfair weight: \n
This woman full of tears \n
And this baby full of love. \n
When they reached the trees and went under, \n
Her hair, which had trailed her, \n
Equal in its magnificence to the tail of the horse, \n
That hair rose up and flew into the branches \n
As if it were a thousand arms, \n
All of them trying to save her. \n
The horse ran off and left her, \n
The baby still in her arms, \n
The two of them hanging from her hair. \n
The baby looked only at her \n
And did not cry, so steady was her cradle. \n
Her sisters came running to save them. \n
But the hair would not let go. \n
From its fear it held on and had to be cut, \n
All of it, from her head. \n
From that day on, my grandmother \n
Wore her hair short like a scream, \n
But it was long like a river in her sleep. \n<|endoftext|>

When Memory, with gentle hand, \n
Has led me to that foreign land \n
Of childhood days, I long to be \n
Again the boy on bended knee, \n
With head a-bow, and drowsy smile \n
Hid in a mother's lap the while, \n
With tender touch and kindly care, \n
She bends above and combs my hair. \n
Ere threats of Time, or ghosts of cares \n
Had paled it to the hue it wears, \n
Its tangled threads of amber light \n
Fell o'er a forehead, fair and white, \n
That only knew the light caress \n
Of loving hands, or sudden press \n
Of kisses that were sifted there \n
The times when mother combed my hair. \n
But its last gleams of gold have slipped \n
Away; and Sorrow's manuscript \n
Is fashioned of the snowy brow-- \n
So lined and underscored now \n
That you, to see it, scarce would guess \n
It e'er had felt the fond caress \n
Of loving lips, or known the care \n
Of those dear hands that combed my hair. \n
I am so tired! Let me be \n
A moment at my mother's knee; \n
One moment--that I may forget \n
The trials waiting for me yet: \n
One moment free from every pain-- \n
O! Mother! Comb my hair again! \n
And I will, oh, so humbly bow, \n
For I've a wife that combs it now. \n<|endoftext|>

Black as a wormhole or as simple as a crayon. \n

From the planets, moons, suns, constellations and universes. My true love has no prejudice or hatred for any one being instead love for all she creates. \n
Her face lights up planets and her waters house life while her skin supports all walking creatures and four legged enigmas. \n

When artists wore a flowing mane, \n
Then, in a sentimental vein, \n
With pastorals they lured the eye, \n
Or sad, sweet scenes of sea and sky. \n
But now that hair sprouts from the face \n
They chuck their paint about the place \n

To baffle one with the unique. \n
I've often wondered if this surge \n
Of hirsute foam denotes some urge \n
Artistic that controls and sways \n
The hand and brain to newer ways. \n
For instance, might we not expect \n
An artist in dundrearies decked \n
In other manner to behave \n
From him who wore a monkey shave? \n
I've known but one of this quaint throng \n
Who wore both hair and whiskers long, \n
But he, poor bloke, was short of cash, \n
And wore a full beard and moustache \n
That he might draw on this supply \n
When price of brushes soared to high ... \n
But there are ways, it seems to me. \n
To test my novel theory. \n
If some brave man would range the land \n
And catch a few of this quaint band \n
And hold them captive for a while \n
Who knows what tricks of school and style \n
One might evolve if, to each man, \n
We gave a different hirsute plan? \n
You doubt, perhaps? But all the same, \n
There might be money in the game. \n<|endoftext|>

house \n
We caught the tread of dancing feet, \n
We loitered down the moonlit street, \n
And stopped beneath the harlot's house. \n
Inside, above the din and fray, \n
We heard the loud musicians play \n
The "Treues Liebes Herz" of Strauss. \n
Like strange mechanical grotesques, \n
Making fantastic arabesques, \n
The shadows raced across the blind. \n
We watched the ghostly dancers spin \n
To sound of horn and violin, \n
Like black leaves wheeling in the wind. \n
Like wire-pulled automatons, \n
Slim silhouetted skeletons \n
Went sidling through the slow quadrille. \n
They took each other by the hand, \n
And danced a stately saraband; \n
Their laughter echoed thin and shrill. \n
Sometimes a clockwork puppet pressed \n
A phantom lover to her breast, \n
Sometimes they seemed to try to sing. \n
Sometimes a horrible marionette \n
Came out, and smaoked its cigarette \n
Upon the steps like a live thing. \n
Then, turning to my love, I said, \n
"The dead are dancing with the dead, \n
The dust is whirling with the dust." \n
But she--she heard the violin, \n
And left my side, and entered in: \n
Love passed into the house of lust. \n
Then suddenly the tune went false, \n
The shadows wearied of the waltz, \n
The shadows ceased to wheel and whirl. \n
And down the long and silent street, \n

Crept like a frightened girl. \n<|endoftext|>

I. \n
The sun goes down in a cold pale flare of light. \n
The trees grow dark: the shadows lean to the east: \n
And lights wink out through the windows, one by one. \n
A clamor of frosty sirens mourns at the night. \n
Pale slate-grey clouds whirl up from the sunken sun. \n
And the wandering one, the inquisitive dreamer of dreams, \n
The eternal asker of answers, stands in the street, \n
And lifts his palms for the first cold ghost of rain. \n
The purple lights leap down the hill before him. \n
The gorgeous night has begun again. \n
'I will ask them all, I will ask them all their dreams, \n
I will hold my light above them and seek their faces. \n
I will hear them whisper, invisible in their veins . . .' \n
The eternal asker of answers becomes as the darkness, \n
Or as a wind blown over a myriad forest, \n
Or as the numberless voices of long-drawn rains. \n
We hear him and take him among us, like a wind of music, \n
Like the ghost of a music we have somewhere heard; \n
We crowd through the streets in a dazzle of pallid lamplight, \n
We pour in a sinister wave, ascend a stair, \n
With laughter and cry, and word upon murmured word; \n
We flow, we descend, we turn . . . and the eternal dreamer \n
Moves among us like light, like evening air . . . \n
Good-night! Good-night! Good-night! We go our ways, \n
The rain runs over the pavement before our feet, \n
The cold rain falls, the rain sings. \n
We walk, we run, we ride. We turn our faces \n
To what the eternal evening brings. \n
Our hands are hot and raw with the stones we have laid, \n
We have built a tower of stone high into the sky, \n
We have built a city of towers. \n
Our hands are light, they are singing with emptiness. \n
Our souls are light; they have shaken a burden of hours . . . \n
What did we build it for? Was it all a dream? . . . \n
Ghostly above us in lamplight the towers gleam . . . \n
And after a while they will fall to dust and rain; \n
Or else we will tear them down with impatient hands; \n
And hew rock out of the earth, and build them again. \n
II. \n
One, from his high bright window in a tower, \n
Leans out, as evening falls, \n
And sees the advancing curtain of the shower \n
Splashing its silver on roofs and walls: \n
Sees how, swift as a shadow, it crosses the city, \n
And murmurs beyond far walls to the sea, \n
Leaving a glimmer of water in the dark canyons, \n
And silver falling from eave and tree. \n
One, from his high bright window, looking down, \n
Peers like a dreamer over the rain-bright town, \n
And thinks its towers are like a dream. \n
The western windows flame in the sun's last flare, \n
Pale roofs begin to gleam. \n
Looking down from a window high in a wall \n
He sees us all; \n
Lifting our pallid faces towards the rain, \n
Searching the sky, and going our ways again, \n
Standing in doorways, waiting under the trees . . . \n
There, in the high bright window he dreams, and sees \n
What we are blind to,—we who mass and crowd \n
From wall to wall in the darkening of a cloud. \n
The gulls drift slowly above the city of towers, \n
Over the roofs to the darkening sea they fly; \n
Night falls swiftly on an evening of rain. \n
The yellow lamps wink one by one again. \n
The towers reach higher and blacker against the sky. \n
III. \n
One, where the pale sea foamed at the yellow sand, \n
With wave upon slowly shattering wave, \n
Turned to the city of towers as evening fell; \n
And slowly walked by the darkening road toward it; \n
And saw how the towers darkened against the sky; \n
And across the distance heard the toll of a bell. \n
Along the darkening road he hurried alone, \n
With his eyes cast down, \n
And thought how the streets were hoarse with a tide of people, \n
With clamor of voices, and numberless faces . . . \n
And it seemed to him, of a sudden, that he would drown \n
Here in the quiet of evening air, \n
These empty and voiceless places . . . \n
And he hurried towards the city, to enter there. \n
Along the darkening road, between tall trees \n
That made a sinister whisper, loudly he walked. \n
Behind him, sea-gulls dipped over long grey seas. \n
Before him, numberless lovers smiled and talked. \n
And death was observed with sudden cries, \n
And birth with laughter and pain. \n
And the trees grew taller and blacker against the skies \n
And night came down again. \n
IV. \n
Up high black walls, up sombre terraces, \n
Clinging like luminous birds to the sides of cliffs, \n
The yellow lights went climbing towards the sky. \n
From high black walls, gleaming vaguely with rain, \n
Each yellow light looked down like a golden eye. \n
They trembled from coign to coign, and tower to tower, \n
Along high terraces quicker than dream they flew. \n
And some of them steadily glowed, and some soon vanished, \n
And some strange shadows threw. \n
And behind them all the ghosts of thoughts went moving, \n
Restlessly moving in each lamplit room, \n
From chair to mirror, from mirror to fire; \n
From some, the light was scarcely more than a gloom: \n
From some, a dazzling desire. \n
And there was one, beneath black eaves, who thought, \n
Combing with lifted arms her golden hair, \n
Of the lover who hurried towards her through the night; \n
And there was one who dreamed of a sudden death \n
As she blew out her light. \n
And there was one who turned from clamoring streets, \n
And walked in lamplit gardens among black trees, \n
And looked at the windy sky, \n
And thought with terror how stones and roots would freeze \n
And birds in the dead boughs cry . . . \n
And she hurried back, as snow fell, mixed with rain, \n
To mingle among the crowds again, \n
To jostle beneath blue lamps along the street; \n
And lost herself in the warm bright coiling dream, \n
With a sound of murmuring voices and shuffling feet. \n
And one, from his high bright window looking down \n
On luminous chasms that cleft the basalt town, \n
Hearing a sea-like murmur rise, \n
Desired to leave his dream, descend from the tower, \n
And drown in waves of shouts and laughter and cries. \n
V. \n
The snow floats down upon us, mingled with rain . . . \n
It eddies around pale lilac lamps, and falls \n
Down golden-windowed walls. \n
We were all born of flesh, in a flare of pain, \n
We do not remember the red roots whence we rose, \n
But we know that we rose and walked, that after a while \n
We shall lie down again. \n
The snow floats down upon us, we turn, we turn, \n
Through gorges filled with light we sound and flow . . . \n
One is struck down and hurt, we crowd about him, \n
We bear him away, gaze after his listless body; \n
But whether he lives or dies we do not know. \n
One of us sings in the street, and we listen to him; \n
The words ring over us like vague bells of sorrow. \n
He sings of a house he lived in long ago. \n
It is strange; this house of dust was the house I lived in; \n
The house you lived in, the house that all of us know. \n
And coiling slowly about him, and laughing at him, \n
And throwing him pennies, we bear away \n
A mournful echo of other times and places, \n
And follow a dream . . . a dream that will not stay. \n
Down long broad flights of lamplit stairs we flow; \n
Noisy, in scattered waves, crowding and shouting; \n
In broken slow cascades. \n
The gardens extend before us . . . We spread out swiftly; \n
Trees are above us, and darkness. The canyon fades . . . \n
And we recall, with a gleaming stab of sadness, \n
Vaguely and incoherently, some dream \n
Of a world we came from, a world of sun-blue hills . . . \n
A black wood whispers around us, green eyes gleam; \n
Someone cries in the forest, and someone kills. \n
We flow to the east, to the white-lined shivering sea; \n
We reach to the west, where the whirling sun went down; \n
We close our eyes to music in bright cafees. \n
We diverge from clamorous streets to streets that are silent. \n
We loaf where the wind-spilled fountain plays. \n
And, growing tired, we turn aside at last, \n
Remember our secret selves, seek out our towers, \n
Lay weary hands on the banisters, and climb; \n
Climbing, each, to his little four-square dream \n
Of love or lust or beauty or death or crime. \n
VI. \n
Over the darkened city, the city of towers, \n
The city of a thousand gates, \n
Over the gleaming terraced roofs, the huddled towers, \n
Over a somnolent whisper of loves and hates, \n
The slow wind flows, drearily streams and falls, \n
With a mournful sound down rain-dark walls. \n
On one side purples the lustrous dusk of the sea, \n
And dreams in white at the city's feet; \n
On one side sleep the plains, with heaped-up hills. \n
Oaks and beeches whisper in rings about it. \n
Above the trees are towers where dread bells beat. \n
The fisherman draws his streaming net from the sea \n
And sails toward the far-off city, that seems \n
Like one vague tower. \n
The dark bow plunges to foam on blue-black waves, \n
And shrill rain seethes like a ghostly music about him \n
In a quiet shower. \n
Rain with a shrill sings on the lapsing waves; \n
Rain thrills over the roofs again; \n
Like a shadow of shifting silver it crosses the city; \n
The lamps in the streets are streamed with rain; \n
And sparrows complain beneath deep eaves, \n
And among whirled leaves \n
The sea-gulls, blowing from tower to lower tower, \n
From wall to remoter wall, \n
Skim with the driven rain to the rising sea-sound \n
And close grey wings and fall . . . \n
. . . Hearing great rain above me, I now remember \n
A girl who stood by the door and shut her eyes: \n
Her pale cheeks glistened with rain, she stood and shivered. \n
Into a forest of silver she vanished slowly . . . \n
Voices about me rise . . . \n
Voices clear and silvery, voices of raindrops,— \n
'We struck with silver claws, we struck her down. \n
We are the ghosts of the singing furies . . . ' \n
A chorus of elfin voices blowing about me \n
Weaves to a babel of sound. Each cries a secret. \n
I run among them, reach out vain hands, and drown. \n
'I am the one who stood beside you and smiled, \n
Thinking your face so strangely young . . . ' \n
'I am the one who loved you but did not dare.' \n
'I am the one you followed through crowded streets, \n
The one who escaped you, the one with red-gleamed hair.' \n
'I am the one you saw to-day, who fell \n
Senseless before you, hearing a certain bell: \n
A bell that broke great memories in my brain.' \n
'I am the one who passed unnoticed before you, \n
Invisible, in a cloud of secret pain.' \n
'I am the one who suddenly cried, beholding \n
The face of a certain man on the dazzling screen. \n
They wrote me that he was dead. It was long ago. \n
I walked in the streets for a long while, hearing nothing, \n
And returned to see it again. And it was so.' \n
Weave, weave, weave, you streaks of rain! \n
I am dissolved and woven again . . . \n
Thousands of faces rise and vanish before me. \n
Thousands of voices weave in the rain. \n
'I am the one who rode beside you, blinking \n
At a dazzle of golden lights. \n
Tempests of music swept me: I was thinking \n
Of the gorgeous promise of certain nights: \n
Of the woman who suddenly smiled at me this day, \n
Smiled in a certain delicious sidelong way, \n
And turned, as she reached the door, \n
To smile once more . . . \n
Her hands are whiter than snow on midnight water. \n
Her throat is golden and full of golden laughter, \n
Her eyes are strange as the stealth of the moon \n
On a night in June . . . \n
She runs among whistling leaves; I hurry after; \n
She dances in dreams over white-waved water; \n
Her body is white and fragrant and cool, \n
Magnolia petals that float on a white-starred pool . . . \n
I have dreamed of her, dreaming for many nights \n
Of a broken music and golden lights, \n
Of broken webs of silver, heavily falling \n
Between my hands and their white desire: \n
And dark-leaved boughs, edged with a golden radiance, \n
Dipping to screen a fire . . . \n
I dream that I walk with her beneath high trees, \n
But as I lean to kiss her face, \n
She is blown aloft on wind, I catch at leaves, \n
And run in a moonless place; \n
And I hear a crashing of terrible rocks flung down, \n
And shattering trees and cracking walls, \n
And a net of intense white flame roars over the town, \n
And someone cries; and darkness falls . . . \n
But now she has leaned and smiled at me, \n
My veins are afire with music, \n
Her eyes have kissed me, my body is turned to light; \n
I shall dream to her secret heart tonight . . . ' \n
He rises and moves away, he says no word, \n
He folds his evening paper and turns away; \n
I rush through the dark with rows of lamplit faces; \n
Fire bells peal, and some of us turn to listen, \n
And some sit motionless in their accustomed places. \n
Cold rain lashes the car-roof, scurries in gusts, \n
Streams down the windows in waves and ripples of lustre; \n
The lamps in the streets are distorted and strange. \n
Someone takes his watch from his pocket and yawns. \n
One peers out in the night for the place to change. \n
Rain . . . rain . . . rain . . . we are buried in rain, \n
It will rain forever, the swift wheels hiss through water, \n
Pale sheets of water gleam in the windy street. \n
The pealing of bells is lost in a drive of rain-drops. \n
Remote and hurried the great bells beat. \n
'I am the one whom life so shrewdly betrayed, \n
Misfortune dogs me, it always hunted me down. \n
And to-day the woman I love lies dead. \n
I gave her roses, a ring with opals; \n
These hands have touched her head. \n
'I bound her to me in all soft ways, \n
I bound her to me in a net of days, \n
Yet now she has gone in silence and said no word. \n
How can we face these dazzling things, I ask you? \n
There is no use: we cry: and are not heard. \n
'They cover a body with roses . . . I shall not see it . . . \n
Must one return to the lifeless walls of a city \n
Whose soul is charred by fire? . . . ' \n
His eyes are closed, his lips press tightly together. \n
Wheels hiss beneath us. He yields us our desire. \n
'No, do not stare so—he is weak with grief, \n
He cannot face you, he turns his eyes aside; \n
He is confused with pain. \n
I suffered this. I know. It was long ago . . . \n
He closes his eyes and drowns in death again.' \n
The wind hurls blows at the rain-starred glistening windows, \n
The wind shrills down from the half-seen walls. \n
We flow on the mournful wind in a dream of dying; \n
And at last a silence falls. \n
VII. \n
Midnight; bells toll, and along the cloud-high towers \n
The golden lights go out . . . \n
The yellow windows darken, the shades are drawn, \n
In thousands of rooms we sleep, we await the dawn, \n
We lie face down, we dream, \n
We cry aloud with terror, half rise, or seem \n
To stare at the ceiling or walls . . . \n
Midnight . . . the last of shattering bell-notes falls. \n
A rush of silence whirls over the cloud-high towers, \n
A vortex of soundless hours. \n
'The bells have just struck twelve: I should be sleeping. \n
But I cannot delay any longer to write and tell you. \n
The woman is dead. \n
She died—you know the way. Just as we planned. \n
Smiling, with open sunlit eyes. \n
Smiling upon the outstretched fatal hand . . .' \n
He folds his letter, steps softly down the stairs. \n
The doors are closed and silent. A gas-jet flares. \n
His shadow disturbs a shadow of balustrades. \n
The door swings shut behind. Night roars above him. \n
Into the night he fades. \n
Wind; wind; wind; carving the walls; \n
Blowing the water that gleams in the street; \n
Blowing the rain, the sleet. \n
In the dark alley, an old tree cracks and falls, \n
Oak-boughs moan in the haunted air; \n
Lamps blow down with a crash and tinkle of glass . . . \n
Darkness whistles . . . Wild hours pass . . . \n
And those whom sleep eludes lie wide-eyed, hearing \n
Above their heads a goblin night go by; \n
Children are waked, and cry, \n
The young girl hears the roar in her sleep, and dreams \n
That her lover is caught in a burning tower, \n
She clutches the pillow, she gasps for breath, she screams . . . \n
And then by degrees her breath grows quiet and slow, \n
She dreams of an evening, long ago: \n
Of colored lanterns balancing under trees, \n
Some of them softly catching afire; \n
And beneath the lanterns a motionless face she sees, \n
Golden with lamplight, smiling, serene . . . \n
The leaves are a pale and glittering green, \n
The sound of horns blows over the trampled grass, \n
Shadows of dancers pass . . . \n
The face smiles closer to hers, she tries to lean \n
Backward, away, the eyes burn close and strange, \n
The face is beginning to change,— \n
It is her lover, she no longer desires to resist, \n
She is held and kissed. \n
She closes her eyes, and melts in a seethe of flame . . . \n
With a smoking ghost of shame . . . \n
Wind, wind, wind . . . Wind in an enormous brain \n
Blowing dark thoughts like fallen leaves . . . \n
The wind shrieks, the wind grieves; \n
It dashes the leaves on walls, it whirls then again; \n
And the enormous sleeper vaguely and stupidly dreams \n
And desires to stir, to resist a ghost of pain. \n
One, whom the city imprisoned because of his cunning, \n
Who dreamed for years in a tower, \n
Seizes this hour \n
Of tumult and wind. He files through the rusted bar, \n
Leans his face to the rain, laughs up at the night, \n
Slides down the knotted sheet, swings over the wall, \n
To fall to the street with a cat-like fall, \n
Slinks round a quavering rim of windy light, \n
And at last is gone, \n
Leaving his empty cell for the pallor of dawn . . . \n
The mother whose child was buried to-day \n
Turns her face to the window; her face is grey; \n
And all her body is cold with the coldness of rain. \n
He would have grown as easily as a tree, \n
He would have spread a pleasure of shade above her, \n
He would have been his father again . . . \n
His growth was ended by a freezing invisible shadow. \n
She lies, and does not move, and is stabbed by the rain. \n
Wind, wind, wind; we toss and dream; \n
We dream we are clouds and stars, blown in a stream: \n
Windows rattle above our beds; \n
We reach vague-gesturing hands, we lift our heads, \n
Hear sounds far off,—and dream, with quivering breath, \n
Our curious separate ways through life and death. \n
VIII. \n
The white fog creeps from the cold sea over the city, \n
Over the pale grey tumbled towers,— \n
And settles among the roofs, the pale grey walls. \n
Along damp sinuous streets it crawls, \n
Curls like a dream among the motionless trees \n
And seems to freeze. \n
The fog slips ghostlike into a thousand rooms, \n
Whirls over sleeping faces, \n
Spins in an atomy dance round misty street lamps; \n
And blows in cloudy waves over open spaces . . . \n
And one from his high window, looking down, \n
Peers at the cloud-white town, \n
And thinks its island towers are like a dream . . . \n
It seems an enormous sleeper, within whose brain \n
Laborious shadows revolve and break and gleam. \n
PART II. \n
I. \n
The round red sun heaves darkly out of the sea. \n
The walls and towers are warmed and gleam. \n
Sounds go drowsily up from streets and wharves. \n
The city stirs like one that is half in dream. \n
And the mist flows up by dazzling walls and windows, \n
Where one by one we wake and rise. \n
We gaze at the pale grey lustrous sea a moment, \n
We rub the darkness from our eyes, \n
And face our thousand devious secret mornings . . . \n
And do not see how the pale mist, slowly ascending, \n
Shaped by the sun, shines like a white-robed dreamer \n
Compassionate over our towers bending. \n
There, like one who gazes into a crystal, \n
He broods upon our city with sombre eyes; \n
He sees our secret fears vaguely unfolding, \n
Sees cloudy symbols shape to rise. \n
Each gleaming point of light is like a seed \n
Dilating swiftly to coiling fires. \n
Each cloud becomes a rapidly dimming face, \n
Each hurrying face records its strange desires. \n
We descend our separate stairs toward the day, \n
Merge in the somnolent mass that fills the street, \n
Lift our eyes to the soft blue space of sky, \n
And walk by the well-known walls with accustomed feet. \n
II. THE FULFILLED DREAM \n
More towers must yet be built—more towers destroyed— \n
Great rocks hoisted in air; \n
And he must seek his bread in high pale sunlight \n
With gulls about him, and clouds just over his eyes . . . \n
And so he did not mention his dream of falling \n
But drank his coffee in silence, and heard in his ears \n
That horrible whistle of wind, and felt his breath \n
Sucked out of him, and saw the tower flash by \n
And the small tree swell beneath him . . . \n
He patted his boy on the head, and kissed his wife, \n
Looked quickly around the room, to remember it,— \n
And so went out . . . For once, he forgot his pail. \n
Something had changed—but it was not the street— \n
The street was just the same—it was himself. \n
Puddles flashed in the sun. In the pawn-shop door \n
The same old black cat winked green amber eyes; \n
The butcher stood by his window tying his apron; \n
The same men walked beside him, smoking pipes, \n
Reading the morning paper . . . \n
He would not yield, he thought, and walk more slowly, \n
As if he knew for certain he walked to death: \n
But with his usual pace,—deliberate, firm, \n
Looking about him calmly, watching the world, \n
Taking his ease . . . Yet, when he thought again \n
Of the same dream, now dreamed three separate times, \n
Always the same, and heard that whistling wind, \n
And saw the windows flashing upward past him,— \n
He slowed his pace a little, and thought with horror \n
How monstrously that small tree thrust to meet him! . . . \n
He slowed his pace a little and remembered his wife. \n
Was forty, then, too old for work like this? \n
Why should it be? He'd never been afraid— \n
His eye was sure, his hand was steady . . . \n
But dreams had meanings. \n
He walked more slowly, and looked along the roofs, \n
All built by men, and saw the pale blue sky; \n
And suddenly he was dizzy with looking at it, \n
It seemed to whirl and swim, \n
It seemed the color of terror, of speed, of death . . . \n
He lowered his eyes to the stones, he walked more slowly; \n
His thoughts were blown and scattered like leaves; \n
He thought of the pail . . . Why, then, was it forgotten? \n
Because he would not need it? \n
Then, just as he was grouping his thoughts again \n
About that drug-store corner, under an arc-lamp, \n
Where first he met the girl whom he would marry,— \n
That blue-eyed innocent girl, in a soft blouse,— \n
He waved his hand for signal, and up he went \n
In the dusty chute that hugged the wall; \n
Above the tree; from girdered floor to floor; \n
Above the flattening roofs, until the sea \n
Lay wide and waved before him . . . And then he stepped \n
Giddily out, from that security, \n
To the red rib of iron against the sky, \n
And walked along it, feeling it sing and tremble; \n
And looking down one instant, saw the tree \n
Just as he dreamed it was; and looked away, \n
And up again, feeling his blood go wild. \n
He gave the signal; the long girder swung \n
Closer to him, dropped clanging into place, \n
Almost pushing him off. Pneumatic hammers \n
Began their madhouse clatter, the white-hot rivets \n
Were tossed from below and deftly caught in pails; \n
He signalled again, and wiped his mouth, and thought \n
A place so high in the air should be more quiet. \n
The tree, far down below, teased at his eyes, \n
Teased at the corners of them, until he looked, \n
And felt his body go suddenly small and light; \n
Felt his brain float off like a dwindling vapor; \n
And heard a whistle of wind, and saw a tree \n
Come plunging up to him, and thought to himself, \n
'By God—I'm done for now, the dream was right . . .' \n
III. INTERLUDE \n
The warm sun dreams in the dust, the warm sun falls \n
On bright red roofs and walls; \n
The trees in the park exhale a ghost of rain; \n
We go from door to door in the streets again, \n
Talking, laughing, dreaming, turning our faces, \n
Recalling other times and places . . . \n
We crowd, not knowing why, around a gate, \n
We crowd together and wait, \n
A stretcher is carried out, voices are stilled, \n
The ambulance drives away. \n
We watch its roof flash by, hear someone say \n
'A man fell off the building and was killed— \n
Fell right into a barrel . . .' We turn again \n
Among the frightened eyes of white-faced men, \n
And go our separate ways, each bearing with him \n
A thing he tries, but vainly, to forget,— \n
A sickened crowd, a stretcher red and wet. \n
A hurdy-gurdy sings in the crowded street, \n
The golden notes skip over the sunlit stones, \n
Wings are upon our feet. \n
The sun seems warmer, the winding street more bright, \n
Sparrows come whirring down in a cloud of light. \n
We bear our dreams among us, bear them all, \n
Like hurdy-gurdy music they rise and fall, \n
Climb to beauty and die. \n
The wandering lover dreams of his lover's mouth, \n
And smiles at the hostile sky. \n
The broker smokes his pipe, and sees a fortune. \n
The murderer hears a cry. \n
IV. NIGHTMARE \n
'Draw three cards, and I will tell your future . . . \n
Draw three cards, and lay them down, \n
Rest your palms upon them, stare at the crystal, \n
And think of time . . . My father was a clown, \n
My mother was a gypsy out of Egypt; \n
And she was gotten with child in a strange way; \n
And I was born in a cold eclipse of the moon, \n
With the future in my eyes as clear as day.' \n
I sit before the gold-embroidered curtain \n
And think her face is like a wrinkled desert. \n
The crystal burns in lamplight beneath my eyes. \n
A dragon slowly coils on the scaly curtain. \n
Upon a scarlet cloth a white skull lies. \n
'Your hand is on the hand that holds three lilies. \n
You will live long, love many times. \n
I see a dark girl here who once betrayed you. \n
I see a shadow of secret crimes. \n
'There was a man who came intent to kill you, \n
And hid behind a door and waited for you; \n
There was a woman who smiled at you and lied. \n
There was a golden girl who loved you, begged you, \n
Crawled after you, and died. \n
'There is a ghost of murder in your blood— \n
Coming or past, I know not which. \n
And here is danger—a woman with sea-green eyes, \n
And white-skinned as a witch . . .' \n
The words hiss into me, like raindrops falling \n
On sleepy fire . . . She smiles a meaning smile. \n
Suspicion eats my brain; I ask a question; \n
Something is creeping at me, something vile; \n
And suddenly on the wall behind her head \n
I see a monstrous shadow strike and spread, \n
The lamp puffs out, a great blow crashes down. \n
I plunge through the curtain, run through dark to the street, \n
And hear swift steps retreat . . . \n
The shades are drawn, the door is locked behind me. \n
Behind the door I hear a hammer sounding. \n
I walk in a cloud of wonder; I am glad. \n
I mingle among the crowds; my heart is pounding; \n
You do not guess the adventure I have had! . . . \n
Yet you, too, all have had your dark adventures, \n
Your sudden adventures, or strange, or sweet . . . \n
My peril goes out from me, is blown among you. \n
We loiter, dreaming together, along the street. \n
V. RETROSPECT \n
Round white clouds roll slowly above the housetops, \n
Over the clear red roofs they flow and pass. \n
A flock of pigeons rises with blue wings flashing, \n
Rises with whistle of wings, hovers an instant, \n
And settles slowly again on the tarnished grass. \n
And one old man looks down from a dusty window \n
And sees the pigeons circling about the fountain \n
And desires once more to walk among those trees. \n
Lovers walk in the noontime by that fountain. \n
Pigeons dip their beaks to drink from the water. \n
And soon the pond must freeze. \n
The light wind blows to his ears a sound of laughter, \n
Young men shuffle their feet, loaf in the sunlight; \n
A girl's laugh rings like a silver bell. \n
But clearer than all these sounds is a sound he hears \n
More in his secret heart than in his ears,— \n
A hammer's steady crescendo, like a knell. \n
He hears the snarl of pineboards under the plane, \n
The rhythmic saw, and then the hammer again,— \n
Playing with delicate strokes that sombre scale . . . \n
And the fountain dwindles, the sunlight seems to pale. \n
Time is a dream, he thinks, a destroying dream; \n
It lays great cities in dust, it fills the seas; \n
It covers the face of beauty, and tumbles walls. \n
Where was the woman he loved? Where was his youth? \n
Where was the dream that burned his brain like fire? \n
Even a dream grows grey at last and falls. \n
He opened his book once more, beside the window, \n
And read the printed words upon that page. \n
The sunlight touched his hand; his eyes moved slowly, \n
The quiet words enchanted time and age. \n
'Death is never an ending, death is a change; \n
Death is beautiful, for death is strange; \n
Death is one dream out of another flowing; \n
Death is a chorded music, softly going \n
By sweet transition from key to richer key. \n
Death is a meeting place of sea and sea.' \n
VI. ADELE AND DAVIS \n
She turned her head on the pillow, and cried once more. \n
And drawing a shaken breath, and closing her eyes, \n
To shut out, if she could, this dingy room, \n
The wigs and costumes scattered around the floor,— \n
Yellows and greens in the dark,—she walked again \n
Those nightmare streets which she had walked so often . . . \n
Here, at a certain corner, under an arc-lamp, \n
Blown by a bitter wind, she stopped and looked \n
In through the brilliant windows of a drug-store, \n
And wondered if she dared to ask for poison: \n
But it was late, few customers were there, \n
The eyes of all the clerks would freeze upon her, \n
And she would wilt, and cry . . . Here, by the river, \n
She listened to the water slapping the wall, \n
And felt queer fascination in its blackness: \n
But it was cold, the little waves looked cruel, \n
The stars were keen, and a windy dash of spray \n
Struck her cheek, and withered her veins . . . And so \n
She dragged herself once more to home, and bed. \n
Paul hadn't guessed it yet—though twice, already, \n
She'd fainted—once, the first time, on the stage. \n
So she must tell him soon—or else—get out . . . \n
How could she say it? That was the hideous thing. \n
She'd rather die than say it! . . . and all the trouble, \n
Months when she couldn't earn a cent, and then, \n
If he refused to marry her . . . well, what? \n
She saw him laughing, making a foolish joke, \n
His grey eyes turning quickly; and the words \n
Fled from her tongue . . . She saw him sitting silent, \n
Brooding over his morning coffee, maybe, \n
And tried again . . . she bit her lips, and trembled, \n
And looked away, and said . . . 'Say Paul, boy,—listen— \n
There's something I must tell you . . . ' There she stopped, \n
Wondering what he'd say . . . What would he say? \n
'Spring it, kid! Don't look so serious!' \n
'But what I've got to say—IS—serious!' \n
Then she could see how, suddenly, he would sober, \n
His eyes would darken, he'd look so terrifying— \n
He always did—and what could she do but cry? \n
Perhaps, then, he would guess—perhaps he wouldn't. \n
And if he didn't, but asked her 'What's the matter?'— \n
She knew she'd never tell—just say she was sick . . . \n
And after that, when would she dare again? \n
And what would he do—even suppose she told him? \n
If it were Felix! If it were only Felix!— \n
She wouldn't mind so much. But as it was, \n
Bitterness choked her, she had half a mind \n
To pay out Felix for never having liked her, \n
By making people think that it was he . . . \n
She'd write a letter to someone, before she died,— \n
Just saying 'Felix did it—and wouldn't marry.' \n
And then she'd die . . . But that was hard on Paul . . . \n
Paul would never forgive her—he'd never forgive her! \n
Sometimes she almost thought Paul really loved her . . . \n
She saw him look reproachfully at her coffin. \n
And then she closed her eyes and walked again \n
Those nightmare streets that she had walked so often: \n
Under an arc-lamp swinging in the wind \n
She stood, and stared in through a drug-store window, \n
Watching a clerk wrap up a little pill-box. \n
But it was late. No customers were there,— \n
Pitiless eyes would freeze her secret in her! \n
And then—what poison would she dare to ask for? \n
And if they asked her why, what would she say? \n
VII. TWO LOVERS: OVERTONES \n
Two lovers, here at the corner, by the steeple, \n
Two lovers blow together like music blowing: \n
And the crowd dissolves about them like a sea. \n
Recurring waves of sound break vaguely about them, \n
They drift from wall to wall, from tree to tree. \n
'Well, am I late?' Upward they look and laugh, \n
They look at the great clock's golden hands, \n
They laugh and talk, not knowing what they say: \n
Only, their words like music seem to play; \n
And seeming to walk, they tread strange sarabands. \n
'I brought you this . . . ' the soft words float like stars \n
Down the smooth heaven of her memory. \n
She stands again by a garden wall, \n
The peach tree is in bloom, pink blossoms fall, \n
Water sings from an opened tap, the bees \n
Glisten and murmur among the trees. \n
Someone calls from the house. She does not answer. \n
Backward she leans her head, \n
And dreamily smiles at the peach-tree leaves, wherethrough \n
She sees an infinite May sky spread \n
A vault profoundly blue. \n
The voice from the house fades far away, \n
The glistening leaves more vaguely ripple and sway . . \n
The tap is closed, the water ceases to hiss . . . \n
Silence . . . blue sky . . . and then, 'I brought you this . . . ' \n
She turns again, and smiles . . . He does not know \n
She smiles from long ago . . . \n
She turns to him and smiles . . . Sunlight above him \n
Roars like a vast invisible sea, \n
Gold is beaten before him, shrill bells of silver; \n
He is released of weight, his body is free, \n
He lifts his arms to swim, \n
Dark years like sinister tides coil under him . . . \n
The lazy sea-waves crumble along the beach \n
With a whirring sound like wind in bells, \n
He lies outstretched on the yellow wind-worn sands \n
Reaching his lazy hands \n
Among the golden grains and sea-white shells . . . \n
'One white rose . . . or is it pink, to-day?' \n
They pause and smile, not caring what they say, \n
If only they may talk. \n
The crowd flows past them like dividing waters. \n
Dreaming they stand, dreaming they walk. \n
'Pink,—to-day!'—Face turns to dream-bright face, \n
Green leaves rise round them, sunshine settles upon them, \n
Water, in drops of silver, falls from the rose. \n
She smiles at a face that smiles through leaves from the mirror. \n
She breathes the fragrance; her dark eyes close . . . \n
Time is dissolved, it blows like a little dust: \n
Time, like a flurry of rain, \n
Patters and passes, starring the window-pane. \n
Once, long ago, one night, \n
She saw the lightning, with long blue quiver of light, \n
Ripping the darkness . . . and as she turned in terror \n
A soft face leaned above her, leaned softly down, \n
Softly around her a breath of roses was blown, \n
She sank in waves of quiet, she seemed to float \n
In a sea of silence . . . and soft steps grew remote . . \n
'Well, let us walk in the park . . . The sun is warm, \n
We'll sit on a bench and talk . . .' They turn and glide, \n
The crowd of faces wavers and breaks and flows. \n
'Look how the oak-tops turn to gold in the sunlight! \n
Look how the tower is changed and glows!' \n
Two lovers move in the crowd like a link of music, \n
We press upon them, we hold them, and let them pass; \n
A chord of music strikes us and straight we tremble; \n
We tremble like wind-blown grass. \n
What was this dream we had, a dream of music, \n
Music that rose from the opening earth like magic \n
And shook its beauty upon us and died away? \n
The long cold streets extend once more before us. \n
The red sun drops, the walls grow grey. \n
VIII. THE BOX WITH SILVER HANDLES \n
Well,—it was two days after my husband died— \n
Two days! And the earth still raw above him. \n
And I was sweeping the carpet in their hall. \n
In number four—the room with the red wall-paper— \n
Some chorus girls and men were singing that song \n
'They'll soon be lighting candles \n
Round a box with silver handles'—and hearing them sing it \n
I started to cry. Just then he came along \n
And stopped on the stairs and turned and looked at me, \n
And took the cigar from his mouth and sort of smiled \n
And said, 'Say, what's the matter?' and then came down \n
Where I was leaning against the wall, \n
And touched my shoulder, and put his arm around me . . . \n
And I was so sad, thinking about it,— \n
Thinking that it was raining, and a cold night, \n
With Jim so unaccustomed to being dead,— \n
That I was happy to have him sympathize, \n
To feel his arm, and leaned against him and cried. \n
And before I knew it, he got me into a room \n
Where a table was set, and no one there, \n
And sat me down on a sofa, and held me close, \n
And talked to me, telling me not to cry, \n
That it was all right, he'd look after me,— \n
But not to cry, my eyes were getting red, \n
Which didn't make me pretty. And he was so nice, \n
That when he turned my face between his hands, \n
And looked at me, with those blue eyes of his, \n
And smiled, and leaned, and kissed me— \n
Somehow I couldn't tell him not to do it, \n
Somehow I didn't mind, I let him kiss me, \n
And closed my eyes! . . . Well, that was how it started. \n
For when my heart was eased with crying, and grief \n
Had passed and left me quiet, somehow it seemed \n
As if it wasn't honest to change my mind, \n
To send him away, or say I hadn't meant it— \n
And, anyway, it seemed so hard to explain! \n
And so we sat and talked, not talking much, \n
But meaning as much in silence as in words, \n
There in that empty room with palms about us, \n
That private dining-room . . . And as we sat there \n
I felt my future changing, day by day, \n
With unknown streets opening left and right, \n
New streets with farther lights, new taller houses, \n
Doors swinging into hallways filled with light, \n
Half-opened luminous windows, with white curtains \n
Streaming out in the night, and sudden music,— \n
And thinking of this, and through it half remembering \n
A quick and horrible death, my husband's eyes, \n
The broken-plastered walls, my boy asleep,— \n
It seemed as if my brain would break in two. \n
My voice began to tremble . . . and when I stood, \n
And told him I must go, and said good-night— \n
I couldn't see the end. How would it end? \n
Would he return to-morrow? Or would he not? \n
And did I want him to—or would I rather \n
Look for another job?—He took my shoulders \n
Between his hands, and looked down into my eyes, \n
And smiled, and said good-night. If he had kissed me, \n
That would have—well, I don't know; but he didn't . . \n
And so I went downstairs, then, half elated, \n
Hoping to close the door before that party \n
In number four should sing that song again— \n
'They'll soon be lighting candles round a box with silver handles'— \n
And sure enough, I did. I faced the darkness. \n
And my eyes were filled with tears. And I was happy. \n
IX. INTERLUDE \n
The days, the nights, flow one by one above us, \n
The hours go silently over our lifted faces, \n
We are like dreamers who walk beneath a sea. \n
Beneath high walls we flow in the sun together. \n
We sleep, we wake, we laugh, we pursue, we flee. \n
We sit at tables and sip our morning coffee, \n
We read the papers for tales of lust or crime. \n
The door swings shut behind the latest comer. \n
We set our watches, regard the time. \n
What have we done? I close my eyes, remember \n
The great machine whose sinister brain before me \n
Smote and smote with a rhythmic beat. \n
My hands have torn down walls, the stone and plaster. \n
I dropped great beams to the dusty street. \n
My eyes are worn with measuring cloths of purple, \n
And golden cloths, and wavering cloths, and pale. \n
I dream of a crowd of faces, white with menace. \n
Hands reach up to tear me. My brain will fail. \n
Here, where the walls go down beneath our picks, \n
These walls whose windows gap against the sky, \n
Atom by atom of flesh and brain and marble \n
Will build a glittering tower before we die . . . \n
The young boy whistles, hurrying down the street, \n
The young girl hums beneath her breath. \n
One goes out to beauty, and does not know it. \n
And one goes out to death. \n
X. SUDDEN DEATH \n
'Number four—the girl who died on the table— \n
The girl with golden hair—' \n
The purpling body lies on the polished marble. \n
We open the throat, and lay the thyroid bare . . . \n
One, who held the ether-cone, remembers \n
Her dark blue frightened eyes. \n
He heard the sharp breath quiver, and saw her breast \n
More hurriedly fall and rise. \n
Her hands made futile gestures, she turned her head \n
Fighting for breath; her cheeks were flushed to scarlet,— \n
And, suddenly, she lay dead. \n
And all the dreams that hurried along her veins \n
Came to the darkness of a sudden wall. \n
Confusion ran among them, they whirled and clamored, \n
They fell, they rose, they struck, they shouted, \n
Till at last a pallor of silence hushed them all. \n
What was her name? Where had she walked that morning? \n
Through what dark forest came her feet? \n
Along what sunlit walls, what peopled street? \n
Backward he dreamed along a chain of days, \n
He saw her go her strange and secret ways, \n
Waking and sleeping, noon and night. \n
She sat by a mirror, braiding her golden hair. \n
She read a story by candlelight. \n
Her shadow ran before her along the street, \n
She walked with rhythmic feet, \n
Turned a corner, descended a stair. \n
She bought a paper, held it to scan the headlines, \n
Smiled for a moment at sea-gulls high in sunlight, \n
And drew deep breaths of air. \n
Days passed, bright clouds of days. Nights passed. And music \n
Murmured within the walls of lighted windows. \n
She lifted her face to the light and danced. \n
The dancers wreathed and grouped in moving patterns, \n
Clustered, receded, streamed, advanced. \n
Her dress was purple, her slippers were golden, \n
Her eyes were blue; and a purple orchid \n
Opened its golden heart on her breast . . . \n
She leaned to the surly languor of lazy music, \n
Leaned on her partner's arm to rest. \n
The violins were weaving a weft of silver, \n
The horns were weaving a lustrous brede of gold, \n
And time was caught in a glistening pattern, \n
Time, too elusive to hold . . . \n
Shadows of leaves fell over her face,—and sunlight: \n
She turned her face away. \n
Nearer she moved to a crouching darkness \n
With every step and day. \n
Death, who at first had thought of her only an instant, \n
At a great distance, across the night, \n
Smiled from a window upon her, and followed her slowly \n
From purple light to light. \n
Once, in her dreams, he spoke out clearly, crying, \n
'I am the murderer, death. \n
I am the lover who keeps his appointment \n
At the doors of breath!' \n
She rose and stared at her own reflection, \n
Half dreading there to find \n
The dark-eyed ghost, waiting beside her, \n
Or reaching from behind \n
To lay pale hands upon her shoulders . . . \n
Or was this in her mind? . . . \n
She combed her hair. The sunlight glimmered \n
Along the tossing strands. \n
Was there a stillness in this hair,— \n
A quiet in these hands? \n
Death was a dream. It could not change these eyes, \n
Blow out their light, or turn this mouth to dust. \n
She combed her hair and sang. She would live forever. \n
Leaves flew past her window along a gust . . . \n
And graves were dug in the earth, and coffins passed, \n
And music ebbed with the ebbing hours. \n
And dreams went along her veins, and scattering clouds \n
Threw streaming shadows on walls and towers. \n
XI. \n
Snow falls. The sky is grey, and sullenly glares \n
With purple lights in the canyoned street. \n
The fiery sign on the dark tower wreathes and flares . . . \n
The trodden grass in the park is covered with white, \n
The streets grow silent beneath our feet . . . \n
The city dreams, it forgets its past to-night. \n
And one, from his high bright window looking down \n
Over the enchanted whiteness of the town, \n
Seeing through whirls of white the vague grey towers, \n
Desires like this to forget what will not pass, \n
The littered papers, the dust, the tarnished grass, \n
Grey death, stale ugliness, and sodden hours. \n
Deep in his heart old bells are beaten again, \n
Slurred bells of grief and pain, \n
Dull echoes of hideous times and poisonous places. \n
He desires to drown in a cold white peace of snow. \n
He desires to forget a million faces . . . \n
In one room breathes a woman who dies of hunger. \n
The clock ticks slowly and stops. And no one winds it. \n
In one room fade grey violets in a vase. \n
Snow flakes faintly hiss and melt on the window. \n
In one room, minute by minute, the flutist plays \n
The lamplit page of music, the tireless scales. \n
His hands are trembling, his short breath fails. \n
In one room, silently, lover looks upon lover, \n
And thinks the air is fire. \n
The drunkard swears and touches the harlot's heartstrings \n
With the sudden hand of desire. \n
And one goes late in the streets, and thinks of murder; \n
And one lies staring, and thinks of death. \n
And one, who has suffered, clenches her hands despairing, \n
And holds her breath . . . \n
Who are all these, who flow in the veins of the city, \n
Coil and revolve and dream, \n
Vanish or gleam? \n
Some mount up to the brain and flower in fire. \n
Some are destroyed; some die; some slowly stream. \n
And the new are born who desire to destroy the old; \n
And fires are kindled and quenched; and dreams are broken, \n
And walls flung down . . . \n
And the slow night whirls in snow over towers of dreamers, \n
And whiteness hushes the town. \n
PART III \n
I \n
As evening falls, \n
And the yellow lights leap one by one \n
Along high walls; \n
And along black streets that glisten as if with rain, \n
The muted city seems \n
Like one in a restless sleep, who lies and dreams \n
Of vague desires, and memories, and half-forgotten pain . . . \n
Along dark veins, like lights the quick dreams run, \n
Flash, are extinguished, flash again, \n
To mingle and glow at last in the enormous brain \n
And die away . . . \n
As evening falls, \n
A dream dissolves these insubstantial walls,— \n
A myriad secretly gliding lights lie bare . . . \n
The lovers rise, the harlot combs her hair, \n
The dead man's face grows blue in the dizzy lamplight, \n
The watchman climbs the stair . . . \n
The bank defaulter leers at a chaos of figures, \n
And runs among them, and is beaten down; \n
The sick man coughs and hears the chisels ringing; \n
The tired clown \n
Sees the enormous crowd, a million faces, \n
Motionless in their places, \n
Ready to laugh, and seize, and crush and tear . . . \n
The dancer smooths her hair, \n
Laces her golden slippers, and runs through the door \n
To dance once more, \n
Hearing swift music like an enchantment rise, \n
Feeling the praise of a thousand eyes. \n
As darkness falls \n
The walls grow luminous and warm, the walls \n
Tremble and glow with the lives within them moving, \n
Moving like music, secret and rich and warm. \n
How shall we live tonight? Where shall we turn? \n
To what new light or darkness yearn? \n
A thousand winding stairs lead down before us; \n
And one by one in myriads we descend \n
By lamplit flowered walls, long balustrades, \n
Through half-lit halls which reach no end. \n
II. THE SCREEN MAIDEN \n
You read—what is it, then that you are reading? \n
What music moves so silently in your mind? \n
Your bright hand turns the page. \n
I watch you from my window, unsuspected: \n
You move in an alien land, a silent age . . . \n
. . . The poet—what was his name—? Tokkei—Tokkei— \n
The poet walked alone in a cold late rain, \n
And thought his grief was like the crying of sea-birds; \n
For his lover was dead, he never would love again. \n
Rain in the dreams of the mind—rain forever— \n
Rain in the sky of the heart—rain in the willows— \n
But then he saw this face, this face like flame, \n
This quiet lady, this portrait by Hiroshigi; \n
And took it home with him; and with it came \n
What unexpected changes, subtle as weather! \n
The dark room, cold as rain, \n
Grew faintly fragrant, stirred with a stir of April, \n
Warmed its corners with light again, \n
And smoke of incense whirled about this portrait, \n
And the quiet lady there, \n
So young, so quietly smiling, with calm hands, \n
Seemed ready to loose her hair, \n
And smile, and lean from the picture, or say one word, \n
The word already clear, \n
Which seemed to rise like light between her eyelids . . \n
He held his breath to hear, \n
And smiled for shame, and drank a cup of wine, \n
And held a candle, and searched her face \n
Through all the little shadows, to see what secret \n
Might give so warm a grace . . . \n
Was it the quiet mouth, restrained a little? \n
The eyes, half-turned aside? \n
The jade ring on her wrist, still almost swinging? . . . \n
The secret was denied, \n
He chose his favorite pen and drew these verses, \n
And slept; and as he slept \n
A dream came into his heart, his lover entered, \n
And chided him, and wept. \n
And in the morning, waking, he remembered, \n
And thought the dream was strange. \n
Why did his darkened lover rise from the garden? \n
He turned, and felt a change, \n
As if a someone hidden smiled and watched him . . . \n
Yet there was only sunlight there. \n
Until he saw those young eyes, quietly smiling, \n
And held his breath to stare, \n
And could have sworn her cheek had turned—a little . . . \n
Had slightly turned away . . . \n
Sunlight dozed on the floor . . . He sat and wondered, \n
Nor left his room that day. \n
And that day, and for many days thereafter, \n
He sat alone, and thought \n
No lady had ever lived so beautiful \n
As Hiroshigi wrought . . . \n
Or if she lived, no matter in what country, \n
By what far river or hill or lonely sea, \n
He would look in every face until he found her . . . \n
There was no other as fair as she. \n
And before her quiet face he burned soft incense, \n
And brought her every day \n
Boughs of the peach, or almond, or snow-white cherry, \n
And somehow, she seemed to say, \n
That silent lady, young, and quietly smiling, \n
That she was happy there; \n
And sometimes, seeing this, he started to tremble, \n
And desired to touch her hair, \n
To lay his palm along her hand, touch faintly \n
With delicate finger-tips \n
The ghostly smile that seemed to hover and vanish \n
Upon her lips . . . \n
Until he knew he loved this quiet lady; \n
And night by night a dread \n
Leered at his dreams, for he knew that Hiroshigi \n
Was many centuries dead,— \n
And the lady, too, was dead, and all who knew her . . \n
Dead, and long turned to dust . . . \n
The thin moon waxed and waned, and left him paler, \n
The peach leaves flew in a gust, \n
And he would surely have died; but there one day \n
A wise man, white with age, \n
Stared at the portrait, and said, 'This Hiroshigi \n
Knew more than archimage,— \n
Cunningly drew the body, and called the spirit, \n
Till partly it entered there . . . \n
Sometimes, at death, it entered the portrait wholly . . \n
Do all I say with care, \n
And she you love may come to you when you call her . . . ' \n
So then this ghost, Tokkei, \n
Ran in the sun, bought wine of a hundred merchants, \n
And alone at the end of day \n
Entered the darkening room, and faced the portrait, \n
And saw the quiet eyes \n
Gleaming and young in the dusk, and held the wine-cup, \n
And knelt, and did not rise, \n
And said, aloud, 'Lo-san, will you drink this wine?' \n
Said it three times aloud. \n
And at the third the faint blue smoke of incense \n
Rose to the walls in a cloud, \n
And the lips moved faintly, and the eyes, and the calm hands stirred; \n
And suddenly, with a sigh, \n
The quiet lady came slowly down from the portrait, \n
And stood, while worlds went by, \n
And lifted her young white hands and took the wine cup; \n
And the poet trembled, and said, \n
'Lo-san, will you stay forever?'—'Yes, I will stay.'— \n
'But what when I am dead?' \n
'When you are dead your spirit will find my spirit, \n
And then we shall die no more.' \n
Music came down upon them, and spring returning, \n
They remembered worlds before, \n
And years went over the earth, and over the sea, \n
And lovers were born and spoke and died, \n
But forever in sunlight went these two immortal, \n
Tokkei and the quiet bride . . . \n
III. HAUNTED CHAMBERS \n
The lamplit page is turned, the dream forgotten; \n
The music changes tone, you wake, remember \n
Deep worlds you lived before,—deep worlds hereafter \n
Of leaf on falling leaf, music on music, \n
Rain and sorrow and wind and dust and laughter. \n
Helen was late and Miriam came too soon. \n
Joseph was dead, his wife and children starving. \n
Elaine was married and soon to have a child. \n
You dreamed last night of fiddler-crabs with fiddles; \n
They played a buzzing melody, and you smiled. \n
To-morrow—what? And what of yesterday? \n
Through soundless labyrinths of dream you pass, \n
Through many doors to the one door of all. \n
Soon as it's opened we shall hear a music: \n
Or see a skeleton fall . . . \n
We walk with you. Where is it that you lead us? \n
We climb the muffled stairs beneath high lanterns. \n
We descend again. We grope through darkened cells. \n
You say: this darkness, here, will slowly kill me. \n
It creeps and weighs upon me . . . Is full of bells. \n
This is the thing remembered I would forget— \n
No matter where I go, how soft I tread, \n
This windy gesture menaces me with death. \n
Fatigue! it says, and points its finger at me; \n
Touches my throat and stops my breath. \n
My fans—my jewels—the portrait of my husband— \n
The torn certificate for my daughter's grave— \n
These are but mortal seconds in immortal time. \n
They brush me, fade away: like drops of water. \n
They signify no crime. \n
Let us retrace our steps: I have deceived you: \n
Nothing is here I could not frankly tell you: \n
No hint of guilt, or faithlessness, or threat. \n
Dreams—they are madness. Staring eyes—illusion. \n
Let us return, hear music, and forget . . . \n
IV. ILLICIT \n
Of what she said to me that night—no matter. \n
The strange thing came next day. \n
My brain was full of music—something she played me—; \n
I couldn't remember it all, but phrases of it \n
Wreathed and wreathed among faint memories, \n
Seeking for something, trying to tell me something, \n
Urging to restlessness: verging on grief. \n
I tried to play the tune, from memory,— \n
But memory failed: the chords and discords climbed \n
And found no resolution—only hung there, \n
And left me morbid . . . Where, then, had I heard it? . . . \n
What secret dusty chamber was it hinting? \n
'Dust', it said, 'dust . . . and dust . . . and sunlight . . \n
A cold clear April evening . . . snow, bedraggled, \n
Rain-worn snow, dappling the hideous grass . . . \n
And someone walking alone; and someone saying \n
That all must end, for the time had come to go . . . ' \n
These were the phrases . . . but behind, beneath them \n
A greater shadow moved: and in this shadow \n
I stood and guessed . . . Was it the blue-eyed lady? \n
The one who always danced in golden slippers— \n
And had I danced with her,—upon this music? \n
Or was it further back—the unplumbed twilight \n
Of childhood?—No—much recenter than that. \n
You know, without my telling you, how sometimes \n
A word or name eludes you, and you seek it \n
Through running ghosts of shadow,—leaping at it, \n
Lying in wait for it to spring upon it, \n
Spreading faint snares for it of sense or sound: \n
Until, of a sudden, as if in a phantom forest, \n
You hear it, see it flash among the branches, \n
And scarcely knowing how, suddenly have it— \n
Well, it was so I followed down this music, \n
Glimpsing a face in darkness, hearing a cry, \n
Remembering days forgotten, moods exhausted, \n
Corners in sunlight, puddles reflecting stars—; \n
Until, of a sudden, and least of all suspected, \n
The thing resolved itself: and I remembered \n
An April afternoon, eight years ago— \n
Or was it nine?—no matter—call it nine— \n
A room in which the last of sunlight faded; \n
A vase of violets, fragrance in white curtains; \n
And, she who played the same thing later, playing. \n
She played this tune. And in the middle of it \n
Abruptly broke it off, letting her hands \n
Fall in her lap. She sat there so a moment, \n
With shoulders drooped, then lifted up a rose, \n
One great white rose, wide opened like a lotos, \n
And pressed it to her cheek, and closed her eyes. \n
'You know—we've got to end this—Miriam loves you . . . \n
If she should ever know, or even guess it,— \n
What would she do?—Listen!—I'm not absurd . . . \n
I'm sure of it. If you had eyes, for women— \n
To understand them—which you've never had— \n
You'd know it too . . . ' So went this colloquy, \n
Half humorous, with undertones of pathos, \n
Half grave, half flippant . . . while her fingers, softly, \n
Felt for this tune, played it and let it fall, \n
Now note by singing note, now chord by chord, \n
Repeating phrases with a kind of pleasure . . . \n
Was it symbolic of the woman's weakness \n
That she could neither break it—nor conclude? \n
It paused . . . and wandered . . . paused again; while she, \n
Perplexed and tired, half told me I must go,— \n
Half asked me if I thought I ought to go . . . \n
Well, April passed with many other evenings, \n
Evenings like this, with later suns and warmer, \n
With violets always there, and fragrant curtains . . . \n
And she was right: and Miriam found it out . . . \n
And after that, when eight deep years had passed— \n
Or nine—we met once more,—by accident . . . \n
But was it just by accident, I wonder, \n
She played this tune?—Or what, then, was intended? . . . \n
V. MELODY IN A RESTAURANT \n
The cigarette-smoke loops and slides above us, \n
Dipping and swirling as the waiter passes; \n
You strike a match and stare upon the flame. \n
The tiny fire leaps in your eyes a moment, \n
And dwindles away as silently as it came. \n
This melody, you say, has certain voices— \n
They rise like nereids from a river, singing, \n
Lift white faces, and dive to darkness again. \n
Wherever you go you bear this river with you: \n
A leaf falls,—and it flows, and you have pain. \n
So says the tune to you—but what to me? \n
What to the waiter, as he pours your coffee, \n
The violinist who suavely draws his bow? \n
That man, who folds his paper, overhears it. \n
A thousand dreams revolve and fall and flow. \n
Some one there is who sees a virgin stepping \n
Down marble stairs to a deep tomb of roses: \n
At the last moment she lifts remembering eyes. \n
Green leaves blow down. The place is checked with shadows. \n
A long-drawn murmur of rain goes down the skies. \n
And oaks are stripped and bare, and smoke with lightning: \n
And clouds are blown and torn upon high forests, \n
And the great sea shakes its walls. \n
And then falls silence . . . And through long silence falls \n
This melody once more: \n
'Down endless stairs she goes, as once before.' \n
So says the tune to him—but what to me? \n
What are the worlds I see? \n
What shapes fantastic, terrible dreams? . . . \n
I go my secret way, down secret alleys; \n
My errand is not so simple as it seems. \n
VI. PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD \n
This is the house. On one side there is darkness, \n
On one side there is light. \n
Into the darkness you may lift your lanterns— \n
O, any number—it will still be night. \n
And here are echoing stairs to lead you downward \n
To long sonorous halls. \n
And here is spring forever at these windows, \n
With roses on the walls. \n
This is her room. On one side there is music— \n
On one side not a sound. \n
At one step she could move from love to silence, \n
Feel myriad darkness coiling round. \n
And here are balconies from which she heard you, \n
Your steady footsteps on the stair. \n
And here the glass in which she saw your shadow \n
As she unbound her hair. \n
Here is the room—with ghostly walls dissolving— \n
The twilight room in which she called you 'lover'; \n
And the floorless room in which she called you 'friend.' \n
So many times, in doubt, she ran between them!— \n
Through windy corridors of darkening end. \n
Here she could stand with one dim light above her \n
And hear far music, like a sea in caverns, \n
Murmur away at hollowed walls of stone. \n
And here, in a roofless room where it was raining, \n
She bore the patient sorrow of rain alone. \n
Your words were walls which suddenly froze around her. \n
Your words were windows,—large enough for moonlight, \n
Too small to let her through. \n
Your letters—fragrant cloisters faint with music. \n
The music that assuaged her there was you. \n
How many times she heard your step ascending \n
Yet never saw your face! \n
She heard them turn again, ring slowly fainter, \n
Till silence swept the place. \n
Why had you gone? . . . The door, perhaps, mistaken . . . \n
You would go elsewhere. The deep walls were shaken. \n
A certain rose-leaf—sent without intention— \n
Became, with time, a woven web of fire— \n
She wore it, and was warm. \n
A certain hurried glance, let fall at parting, \n
Became, with time, the flashings of a storm. \n
Yet, there was nothing asked, no hint to tell you \n
Of secret idols carved in secret chambers \n
From all you did and said. \n
Nothing was done, until at last she knew you. \n
Nothing was known, till, somehow, she was dead. \n
How did she die?—You say, she died of poison. \n
Simple and swift. And much to be regretted. \n
You did not see her pass \n
So many thousand times from light to darkness, \n
Pausing so many times before her glass; \n
You did not see how many times she hurried \n
To lean from certain windows, vainly hoping, \n
Passionate still for beauty, remembered spring. \n
You did not know how long she clung to music, \n
You did not hear her sing. \n
Did she, then, make the choice, and step out bravely \n
From sound to silence—close, herself, those windows? \n
Or was it true, instead, \n
That darkness moved,—for once,—and so possessed her? . . . \n
We'll never know, you say, for she is dead. \n
VII. PORCELAIN \n
You see that porcelain ranged there in the window— \n
Platters and soup-plates done with pale pink rosebuds, \n
And tiny violets, and wreaths of ivy? \n
See how the pattern clings to the gleaming edges! \n
They're works of art—minutely seen and felt, \n
Each petal done devoutly. Is it failure \n
To spend your blood like this? \n
Study them . . . you will see there, in the porcelain, \n
If you stare hard enough, a sort of swimming \n
Of lights and shadows, ghosts within a crystal— \n
My brain unfolding! There you'll see me sitting \n
Day after day, close to a certain window, \n
Looking down, sometimes, to see the people . . . \n
Sometimes my wife comes there to speak to me . . . \n
Sometimes the grey cat waves his tail around me . . . \n
Goldfish swim in a bowl, glisten in sunlight, \n
Dilate to a gorgeous size, blow delicate bubbles, \n
Drowse among dark green weeds. On rainy days, \n
You'll see a gas-light shedding light behind me— \n
An eye-shade round my forehead. There I sit, \n
Twirling the tiny brushes in my paint-cups, \n
Painting the pale pink rosebuds, minute violets, \n
Exquisite wreaths of dark green ivy leaves. \n
On this leaf, goes a dream I dreamed last night \n
Of two soft-patterned toads—I thought them stones, \n
Until they hopped! And then a great black spider,— \n
Tarantula, perhaps, a hideous thing,— \n
It crossed the room in one tremendous leap. \n
Here,—as I coil the stems between two leaves,— \n
It is as if, dwindling to atomy size, \n
I cried the secret between two universes . . . \n
A friend of mine took hasheesh once, and said \n
Just as he fell asleep he had a dream,— \n
Though with his eyes wide open,— \n
And felt, or saw, or knew himself a part \n
Of marvelous slowly-wreathing intricate patterns, \n
Plane upon plane, depth upon coiling depth, \n
Amazing leaves, folding one on another, \n
Voluted grasses, twists and curves and spirals— \n
All of it darkly moving . . . as for me, \n
I need no hasheesh for it—it's too easy! \n
Soon as I shut my eyes I set out walking \n
In a monstrous jungle of monstrous pale pink roseleaves, \n
Violets purple as death, dripping with water, \n
And ivy-leaves as big as clouds above me. \n
Here, in a simple pattern of separate violets— \n
With scalloped edges gilded—here you have me \n
Thinking of something else. My wife, you know,— \n
There's something lacking—force, or will, or passion, \n
I don't know what it is—and so, sometimes, \n
When I am tired, or haven't slept three nights, \n
Or it is cloudy, with low threat of rain, \n
I get uneasy—just like poplar trees \n
Ruffling their leaves—and I begin to think \n
Of poor Pauline, so many years ago, \n
And that delicious night. Where is she now? \n
I meant to write—but she has moved, by this time, \n
And then, besides, she might find out I'm married. \n
Well, there is more—I'm getting old and timid— \n
The years have gnawed my will. I've lost my nerve! \n
I never strike out boldly as I used to— \n
But sit here, painting violets, and remember \n
That thrilling night. Photographers, she said, \n
Asked her to pose for them; her eyes and forehead,— \n
Dark brown eyes, and a smooth and pallid forehead,— \n
Were thought so beautiful.—And so they were. \n
Pauline . . . These violets are like words remembered . . . \n
Darling! she whispered . . . Darling! . . . Darling! . . . Darling! \n
Well, I suppose such days can come but once. \n
Lord, how happy we were! . . . \n
Here, if you only knew it, is a story— \n
Here, in these leaves. I stopped my work to tell it, \n
And then, when I had finished, went on thinking: \n
A man I saw on a train . . . I was still a boy . . . \n
Who killed himself by diving against a wall. \n
Here is a recollection of my wife, \n
When she was still my sweetheart, years ago. \n
It's funny how things change,—just change, by growing, \n
Without an effort . . . And here are trivial things,— \n
A chill, an errand forgotten, a cut while shaving; \n
A friend of mine who tells me he is married . . . \n
Or is that last so trivial? Well, no matter! \n
This is the sort of thing you'll see of me, \n
If you look hard enough. This, in its way, \n
Is a kind of fame. My life arranged before you \n
In scrolls of leaves, rosebuds, violets, ivy, \n
Clustered or wreathed on plate and cup and platter . . . \n
Sometimes, I say, I'm just like John the Baptist— \n
You have my head before you . . . on a platter. \n
VIII. COFFINS: INTERLUDE \n
Wind blows. Snow falls. The great clock in its tower \n
Ticks with reverberant coil and tolls the hour: \n
At the deep sudden stroke the pigeons fly . . . \n
The fine snow flutes the cracks between the flagstones. \n
We close our coats, and hurry, and search the sky. \n
We are like music, each voice of it pursuing \n
A golden separate dream, remote, persistent, \n
Climbing to fire, receding to hoarse despair. \n
What do you whisper, brother? What do you tell me? . . . \n
We pass each other, are lost, and do not care. \n
One mounts up to beauty, serenely singing, \n
Forgetful of the steps that cry behind him; \n
One drifts slowly down from a waking dream. \n
One, foreseeing, lingers forever unmoving . . . \n
Upward and downward, past him there, we stream. \n
One has death in his eyes: and walks more slowly. \n
Death, among jonquils, told him a freezing secret. \n
A cloud blows over his eyes, he ponders earth. \n
He sees in the world a forest of sunlit jonquils: \n
A slow black poison huddles beneath that mirth. \n
Death, from street to alley, from door to window, \n
Cries out his news,—of unplumbed worlds approaching, \n
Of a cloud of darkness soon to destroy the tower. \n
But why comes death,—he asks,—in a world so perfect? \n
Or why the minute's grey in the golden hour? \n
Music, a sudden glissando, sinister, troubled, \n
A drift of wind-torn petals, before him passes \n
Down jangled streets, and dies. \n
The bodies of old and young, of maimed and lovely, \n
Are slowly borne to earth, with a dirge of cries. \n
Down cobbled streets they come; down huddled stairways; \n
Through silent halls; through carven golden doorways; \n
From freezing rooms as bare as rock. \n
The curtains are closed across deserted windows. \n
Earth streams out of the shovel; the pebbles knock. \n
Mary, whose hands rejoiced to move in sunlight; \n
Silent Elaine; grave Anne, who sang so clearly; \n
Fugitive Helen, who loved and walked alone; \n
Miriam too soon dead, darkly remembered; \n
Childless Ruth, who sorrowed, but could not atone; \n
Jean, whose laughter flashed over depths of terror, \n
And Eloise, who desired to love but dared not; \n
Doris, who turned alone to the dark and cried,— \n
They are blown away like windflung chords of music, \n
They drift away; the sudden music has died. \n
And one, with death in his eyes, comes walking slowly \n
And sees the shadow of death in many faces, \n
And thinks the world is strange. \n
He desires immortal music and spring forever, \n
And beauty that knows no change. \n
IX. CABARET \n
We sit together and talk, or smoke in silence. \n
You say (but use no words) 'this night is passing \n
As other nights when we are dead will pass . . .' \n
Perhaps I misconstrue you: you mean only, \n
'How deathly pale my face looks in that glass . . .' \n
You say: 'We sit and talk, of things important . . . \n
How many others like ourselves, this instant, \n
Mark the pendulum swinging against the wall? \n
How many others, laughing, sip their coffee— \n
Or stare at mirrors, and do not talk at all? . . . \n
'This is the moment' (so you would say, in silence) \n
When suddenly we have had too much of laughter: \n
And a freezing stillness falls, no word to say. \n
Our mouths feel foolish . . . For all the days hereafter \n
What have we saved—what news, what tune, what play? \n
'We see each other as vain and futile tricksters,— \n
Posturing like bald apes before a mirror; \n
No pity dims our eyes . . . \n
How many others, like ourselves, this instant, \n
See how the great world wizens, and are wise? . . .' \n
Well, you are right . . . No doubt, they fall, these seconds . . . \n
When suddenly all's distempered, vacuous, ugly, \n
And even those most like angels creep for schemes. \n
The one you love leans forward, smiles, deceives you, \n
Opens a door through which you see dark dreams. \n
But this is momentary . . . or else, enduring, \n
Leads you with devious eyes through mists and poisons \n
To horrible chaos, or suicide, or crime . . . \n
And all these others who at your conjuration \n
Grow pale, feeling the skeleton touch of time,— \n
Or, laughing sadly, talk of things important, \n
Or stare at mirrors, startled to see their faces, \n
Or drown in the waveless vacuum of their days,— \n
Suddenly, as from sleep, awake, forgetting \n
This nauseous dream; take up their accustomed ways, \n
Exhume the ghost of a joke, renew loud laughter, \n
Forget the moles above their sweethearts' eyebrows, \n
Lean to the music, rise, \n
And dance once more in a rose-festooned illusion \n
With kindness in their eyes . . . \n
They say (as we ourselves have said, remember) \n
'What wizardry this slow waltz works upon us! \n
And how it brings to mind forgotten things!' \n
They say 'How strange it is that one such evening \n
Can wake vague memories of so many springs!' \n
And so they go . . . In a thousand crowded places, \n
They sit to smile and talk, or rise to ragtime, \n
And, for their pleasures, agree or disagree. \n
With secret symbols they play on secret passions. \n
With cunning eyes they see \n
The innocent word that sets remembrance trembling, \n
The dubious word that sets the scared heart beating . . . \n
The pendulum on the wall \n
Shakes down seconds . . . They laugh at time, dissembling; \n
Or coil for a victim and do not talk at all. \n
X. LETTER \n
From time to time, lifting his eyes, he sees \n
The soft blue starlight through the one small window, \n
The moon above black trees, and clouds, and Venus,— \n
And turns to write . . . The clock, behind ticks softly. \n
It is so long, indeed, since I have written,— \n
Two years, almost, your last is turning yellow,— \n
That these first words I write seem cold and strange. \n
Are you the man I knew, or have you altered? \n
Altered, of course—just as I too have altered— \n
And whether towards each other, or more apart, \n
We cannot say . . . I've just re-read your letter— \n
Not through forgetfulness, but more for pleasure— \n
Pondering much on all you say in it \n
Of mystic consciousness—divine conversion— \n
The sense of oneness with the infinite,— \n
Faith in the world, its beauty, and its purpose . . . \n
Well, you believe one must have faith, in some sort, \n
If one's to talk through this dark world contented. \n
But is the world so dark? Or is it rather \n
Our own brute minds,—in which we hurry, trembling, \n
Through streets as yet unlighted? This, I think. \n
You have been always, let me say, "romantic,"— \n
Eager for color, for beauty, soon discontented \n
With a world of dust and stones and flesh too ailing: \n
Even before the question grew to problem \n
And drove you bickering into metaphysics, \n
You met on lower planes the same great dragon, \n
Seeking release, some fleeting satisfaction, \n
In strange aesthetics . . . You tried, as I remember, \n
One after one, strange cults, and some, too, morbid, \n
The cruder first, more violent sensations, \n
Gorgeously carnal things, conceived and acted \n
With splendid animal thirst . . . Then, by degrees,— \n
Savoring all more delicate gradations \n
In all that hue and tone may play on flesh, \n
Or thought on brain,—you passed, if I may say so, \n
From red and scarlet through morbid greens to mauve. \n
Let us regard ourselves, you used to say, \n
As instruments of music, whereon our lives \n
Will play as we desire: and let us yield \n
These subtle bodies and subtler brains and nerves \n
To all experience plays . . . And so you went \n
From subtle tune to subtler, each heard once, \n
Twice or thrice at the most, tiring of each; \n
And closing one by one your doors, drew in \n
Slowly, through darkening labyrinths of feeling, \n
Towards the central chamber . . . Which now you've reached. \n
What, then's, the secret of this ultimate chamber— \n
Or innermost, rather? If I see it clearly \n
It is the last, and cunningest, resort \n
Of one who has found this world of dust and flesh,— \n
This world of lamentations, death, injustice, \n<|endoftext|>
house \n
Lured by the wall, and drawn \n
To stare below the roof, \n
Where pigeons nest aloof \n
From prowling cats and men, \n
I count the sash and bar \n
Secured to granite stone, \n
And note the daylight gone, \n
Supper and silence near. \n
Close to the wall inside, \n
Immured, empty of love, \n
A man I have wondered of \n
Lies patient, vacant-eye. \n
A month and a day ago \n
He stopped his car and found \n
A girl on the darkening ground, \n
And killed her in the snow. \n
Beside his cell, I am told, \n
Hardy perennial bums \n
Complain till twilight comes \n
For hunger and for cold. \n
They hardly know of a day \n
That saw their hunger pass. \n
Bred to the dark, their flesh \n
Peacefully withers away. \n
The man who sits alone, \n
He is the one for wonder, \n
Who sways his fingers under \n
The cleanly shaven chin, \n
Who sees, in the shaving mirror \n
Pinned to the barren wall, \n
The uprooted ghost of all: \n
The simple, easy terror. \n
Caught between sky and earth, \n
Poor stupid animal, \n
Stripped naked to the wall, \n
He saw the blundered birth \n
Of daemons beyond sound. \n
Sick of the dark, he rose \n
For love, and now he goes \n
Back to the broken ground. \n
Now, as he grips the chain \n
And holds the wall, to bear \n
What no man ever bore, \n
He hears the bums complain; \n
But I mourn no soul but his, \n
Not even the bums who die, \n
Nor the homely girl whose cry \n
Crumbled his pleading kiss. \n<|endoftext|>
house \n
After you’ve negotiated that artfully-conceived \n
sharp elbow bend in the long, grand drive \n
through the fields of its estate, \n
and it hoves into view, \n
you always gasp – this palace \n
- no, more like a temple with living quarters – \n
set deep in the countryside, yet as sure \n
as one in Athens or in Rome; \n
yet that too is artfully contrived - \n
the slight mound it’s built on, \n
the cunning proportion that magnifies, \n
disguises, with its public face \n
the aptness of a family home; \n
its public rooms so grand, just echoing enough \n
to magnify a public speech; its family rooms \n
smallish, cosy; love and friendliness \n
live here. It says to the world, \n
stability; tradition re-affirmed; yet \n
this is our familiar family home. \n
It has its rooms, as rooms should be, \n
devoted to each family pursuit: \n
here’s the grand library \n
but here, with books so evidently, lovingly well read; \n
you almost missed the little girl, her hair and knees \n
curled round a book, deep in that leather green armchair; \n
the study, where your breathing seems to change, \n
there’s such a still and living silence here; \n
the nursery that emanates a lifetime’s care; \n
the children’s bedrooms set around it, \n
through which you ran and laughed and ran again; the window seats \n
from which you looked so wistfully \n
as childhood’s assurance faded into teenage questioning; \n
a house to leave, \n
a house to come back to; \n
a metaphor \n
as living, haunting, as the poetry it is. \n<|endoftext|>
house \n
In Arthur's house whileome was I \n
When happily the time went by \n
In midmost glory of his days. \n
He held his court then in a place \n
Whereof ye shall not find the name \n
In any story of his fame: \n
Caerliel good sooth men called it not, \n
Nor London Town, nor Camelot; \n
Yet therein had we bliss enow. \n
--Ah, far off was the overthrow \n
Of all that Britain praised and loved; \n
And though among us lightly moved \n
A love that could but lead to death, \n
Smooth-skinned he seemed, of rosy breath, \n
A fear to sting a lady's lip, \n
No ruin of goodly fellowship, \n
No shame and death of all things good. \n
Forgive the old carle's babbling mood; \n
As here I sit grey-haired and old, \n
My life gone as a story told, \n
Ye bid me tell a story too; \n
And then the evil days and few, \n
That yet were overlong for me \n
Rise up so clear I may not see \n
The pictures of my minstrel lore. \n
Well hearken! on a day of yore \n
From prime of morn the court did ride \n
Amidmost of the summertide \n
To search the dwellings of the deer \n
Until the heat of noon was near; \n
Then slackening speed awhile they went \n
Adown a ragged thorn-bushed bent \n
At whose feet grew a tangled wood \n
Of oak and holly nowise good: \n
But therethrough with some pain indeed \n
And rending of the ladies' weed \n
They won at last, and after found \n
A space of green-sward grown around \n
By oak and holly set full close; \n
And in the midst of it arose \n
Two goodly sycamores that made \n
A wide and little sun-pierced shade \n
About their high boles straight and green: \n
A fount was new-born there-between, \n
And running on as clear as glass, \n
Flowed winding on amid the grass \n
Until the thick wood swallowed it. \n
A place for happy folk to sit \n
While the hot day grew hotter still \n
Till eve began to work his will. \n
--So might those happy people think \n
Who grudged to see the red sun sink \n
And end another day of bliss \n
Although no joy tomorn should miss -- \n
They laughed for joy as they drew nigh \n
The shade and fount: but lo, thereby \n
A man beside the fountain laid \n
The while his horse 'twixt sun and shade \n
Cropped the sweet grass: but little care \n
Had these of guile or giant's lair, \n
And scarce a foot before the Queen \n
Rode Gawain o'er the daisied green \n
To see what man his pleasure took; \n
Who rose up in meanwhile and shook \n
His tangled hair aback, as one \n
Who e'en but now his sleep hath done. \n
Rough-head and yellow-haired was he \n
Great-eyed, as folk have told to me, \n
And big and stout enow of limb: \n
As one who thinks no harm he smiled, \n
And cried out: "Well met in the wild, \n
Fair King and Queen; and ye withal \n
Sweet dames and damsels! Well befal \n
This day, whereon I see thee nigh, \n
O Lancelot, before I die! \n
And surely shall my heart rejoice \n
Sir Gawain, when I hear thy voice!" \n
Then Lancelot laughed: "Thou knowest us then \n
Full well among a many men?" \n
"As quoth the lion to the mouse," \n
The man said; "in King Arthur's House \n
Men are not names of men alone, \n
But coffers rather of deeds done." \n
The Queen smiled blithe of heart, and spake: \n
"Hast thou done deeds for ladies' sake?" \n
"Nay Dame," he said, "I am but young; \n
A little have I lived and sung \n
And seen thy face this happy noon." \n
The King said: "May we hearken soon \n
Some merry tale of thee? for I \n
Am skilled to know men low and high \n
And deem thee neither churl nor fool." \n
Said he, "My fathers went to school \n
Where folk are taught a many things, \n
But not by bliss: men called them kings \n
In days when kings were near to seek; \n
But as a long thread waxeth weak, \n
So is it with our house; and now \n
I wend me home from oaken bough \n
Unto a stead where roof and wall \n
Shall not have over far to fall \n
When their last day comes." \n
As he spake \n
He reddened: "Nathless for their sake, \n
Whom the world loved once, mock not me \n
O King, if thence I bring to thee \n
A morsel and a draught of wine, \n
Though nothing king-like here thou dine." \n
Of some kind word King Arthur thought, \n
But ere he spake the woodman caught \n
His forest-nag and leapt thereon, \n
And through the tangled brake was gone. \n
Then leapt the King down, glad at heart, \n
Thinking, This day shall not depart \n
Without some voice from days that were; \n
And lightly leapt down Guenevere, \n
And man and maid lay presently \n
Neath the bee-laden branches high, \n
And sweet the scent of trodden grass \n
Amid the blossoms' perfume was. \n
There long they lay, and little spake, \n
As folk right loth the calm to break; \n
Till lo upon the forest-breeze \n
A noise of folk, and from the trees \n
They came: the first-seen forester, \n
A grizzled carle in such-like gear, \n
And then two maidens poorly clad \n
Though each a silver chaplet had \n
And round her neck a golden chain: \n
And last two varlets led a wain \n
Drawn by white oxen well bedight \n
With oaken boughs and lilies white; \n
Therein there lay a cask of wine \n
And baskets piled with bread full fine, \n
And flesh of hart and roe and hare; \n
And in the midst upon a chair \n
Done over with a cloth of gold \n
There sat a man exceeding old \n
With long white locks: and clad was he \n
No other than his company \n
Save that a golden crown he bore \n
Full fairly fashioned as of yore, \n
And with a sword was girt about \n
Such as few folk will see I doubt. \n
Right great it was: the scabbard thin \n
Was fashioned of a serpent's skin, \n
In every scale a stone of worth; \n
Of tooth of sea-lion of the north \n
The cross was, and the blood-boot stone \n
That heals the hurt the blade hath done \n
Hung down therefrom in silken purse: \n
The ruddy kin of Niblung's curse \n
O'er tresses of a sea-wife's hair \n
Was wrapped about the handle fair; \n
And last a marvellous sapphire stone \n
Amidst of the great pommel shone, \n
A blue flame in the forest green. \n
And Arthur deemed he ne'er had seen \n
So fair a sword: nay not when he \n
The wonder of the land-locked sea \n
Drew from the stone that Christmas-tide. \n
Now forth the forest youth did ride, \n
Leapt down beside the King, and spake: \n
"King Arthur for thy greatness' sake \n
My grandsire comes to look on thee; \n
My father standeth here by me; \n
These maidens are my sisters twain; \n
My brethren draw out from the wain \n
Somewhat thy woodland cheer to mend." \n
Thereat his sire the knee did bend \n
Before the King, who o'er the brown \n
Rough sleeve of the man's homespun gown \n
Beheld a goodly golden ring: \n
And fell to greater marvelling \n
When he beheld how fine and fair \n
The woodman's kneeling sisters were. \n
And all folk thereby deemed in sooth \n
That (save indeed the first seen youth) \n
These folk were nobler e'en than those \n
Of Arthur's wonder of a house. \n
But now the elder drew anigh, \n
By half a head was he more high \n
Than Arthur or than Lancelot, \n
Nor had eld bent him: he kneeled not \n
Before the King, but smiling took \n
His hands in hands that nowise shook; \n
And the King joyed as he who sees \n
One of his fathers' images \n
Stand glad before him in a dream. \n
Then down beside the bubbling stream \n
They sat together, and the King \n
Was loth to fall a questioning; \n
So first the elder spake and said: \n
"It joys me of thy goodlihead \n
O great king of our land; and though \n
Our blood within thee doth not flow, \n
And I who was a king of yore \n
May scarcely kneel thy feet before, \n
Yet do I deem thy right the best \n
Of all the kings who rule the West. \n
I love thy name and fame: behold, \n
King Arthur, I am grown so old \n
In guilelessness, the Gods have sent, \n
Be I content or uncontent, \n
This gift unto my latter days \n
That I may see as through a haze \n
The lives and deeds of days to come: \n
I laugh for some, I weep for some -- \n
I neither laugh nor weep for thee, \n
But trembling through the clouds I see \n
Thy life and glory to the end; \n
And how the sweet and bitter blend \n
Within the cup that thou must drink. \n
Good is it that thou shalt not shrink \n
From either: that the afterdays \n
Shall still win glory from thy praise \n
And scarce believe thee laid asleep \n
When o'er thy deeds the days lie deep." \n
He ceased but his old lips moved still, \n
As though they would the tale fulfil \n
His heart kept secret: Arthur's eyes \n
Gleamed with the pride that needs would rise \n
Up from his heart, and low he said: \n
"I know the living by the dead \n
I know the future by the past." \n
Wise eyes and kind the elder cast \n
Upon him; while a nameless fear \n
Smote to the heart of Guenevere, \n
And, fainting there, was turned to love: \n
And thence a nameless pain did move \n
The noble heart of Lancelot, \n
The store of longing unforgot. \n
-- And west a little moved the sun \n
And noon began, and noon was done. \n
But as the elder's grey eyes turned \n
On Guenevere's, her sweet face burned \n
With sweet shame; as though she knew \n
He read her story through and through. \n
Kindly he looked on her and said: \n
"O Queen, the chief of goodlihead, \n
Be blithe and glad this day at least \n
When in my fathers' house ye feast: \n
For surely in their ancient hall \n
Ye sit now: look, there went the wall \n
Where yon turf ridge runs west-away: \n
Time was I heard my grand-dame say \n
She saw this stream run bubbling down \n
The hall-floor shut in trench of stone; \n
Therein she washed her father's cup \n
That last eve e'er the fire went up \n
O'er ridge and rafter and she passed \n
Betwixt the foeman's spears the last \n
Of all the women, wrapping round \n
This sword the gift of Odin's ground." \n
He shook the weapon o'er his knee, \n
Thereon gazed Arthur eagerly. \n
"Draw it, my lord," quoth Guenevere, \n
"Of such things have we little fear \n
In Arthur's house." And Lancelot rose \n
To look upon the treasure close. \n
But grimly smiled the ancient man: \n
"E'en as the sun arising wan \n
In the black sky when Heimdall's horn \n
Screams out and the last day is born, \n
This blade to eyes of men shall be \n
On that dread day I shall not see --" \n
Fierce was his old face for a while: \n
But once again he 'gan to smile \n
And took the Queen's slim lily hand \n
And set it on the deadly brand \n
Then laughed and said: "Hold this, O Queen, \n
Thine hand is where God's hands have been, \n
For this is Tyrfing: who knows when \n
His blade was forged? Belike ere men \n
Had dwelling on the middle-earth. \n
At least a man's life is it worth \n
To draw it out once: so behold \n
These peace-strings wrought of pearl and gold \n
The scabbard to the cross that bind \n
Lest a rash hand and heart made blind \n
Should draw it forth unwittingly." \n
Blithe laughed King Arthur: "Sir," said he, \n
"We well may deem in days by gone \n
This sword, the blade of such an one \n
As thou hast been, would seldom slide \n
Back to its sheath unsatisfied. \n
Lo now how fair a feast thy kin \n
Have dight for us and might we win \n
Some tale of thee in Tyrfing's praise, \n
Some deed he wrought in greener days, \n
This were a blithesome hour indeed." \n
"Sir," said the elder, "little need \n
To pray me hereof. Please ye dine \n
And drink a cup of woodman's wine, \n
Surely meantime some tale shall stir \n
Within my heart of days that were." \n
Then to their meat they gat and there \n
Feasted amid the woodland fair \n
The fairest folk of all the land. \n
Ah me when first the Queen's fair hand \n
Drew near the kneeling forest youth \n
New-wrought the whole world seemed in sooth \n
And nothing left therein of ill. \n
So at the last the Queen did fill \n
A cup of wine, and drank and said: \n
"In memory of thy fathers dead \n
I drink, fair lord, drink now with me \n
And then bethink thee presently \n
Of deeds that once won prize and praise \n
The glory of thy fathers' days." \n
He drank and laughed and said," Nay, nay, \n
Keep we the peace-strings whole today. \n
This draught from where thy lips have been \n
Within mine old heart maketh green \n
The memory of a love full true, \n
The first recorded deed that drew \n
My fathers' house from dark to light. \n
If thus my grandame told aright, \n
A rougher place our land was then, \n
Quoth she, than with us living men, \n
And other trees were in the wood \n
And folk of somewhat other blood \n
Than ours: then were the small-eyed bears \n
More plenty in the woodland lairs \n
Than badgers now: no holiday \n
It was to chase the wolves away, \n
Yea there were folk who had to tell \n
Of lyngworms lying on the fell, \n
And fearful things by lake and fen, \n
And manlike shapes that were not men. \n
Then fay-folk roamed the woods at noon, \n
And on the grave-mound in the moon \n
Faint gleamed the flickering treasure-flame. \n
Days of the world that won no fame, \n
Yet now, quoth she, folk looking back \n
Across the tumult and the wrack \n
And swelling up of windy lies \n
And dull fool-fashioned cruelties, \n
Deem that in those days God abode \n
On earth and shared ill times and good \n
And right and wrong with that same folk \n
Their hands had fashioned for the yoke. \n
Quoth she, of such nought tells my tale, \n
Yet saith that such as should prevail \n
In those days o'er the fears of earth \n
Must needs have been some deal of worth, \n
And saith that had ye seen a kin \n
Who dwelt these very woods within \n
Them at the least ye would have told \n
For cousins of the Gods of old. \n
Amongst all these it tells of one, \n
The goodman's last-begotten son, \n
Some twenty summers old: as fair \n
As any flower that blossomed there \n
In sun and rain, and strong therewith \n
And lissom as a willow withe. \n
Now through these woods amidst of June \n
This youngling went until at noon \n
From out of the thicket his fair face \n
Peered forth upon this very place; \n
For he had been a-hunting nigh \n
And wearied thought a while to lie \n
Beside the freshness of the stream. \n
But lo as in a morning dream \n
The place was changed, for there was dight \n
A fair pavilion blue and white \n
E'en where we play, and all around \n
Was talk of men and diverse sound, \n
Tinkling of bit and neigh of steed \n
Clashing of arms and iron weed. \n
For round about the painted tent \n
Armed folk a many came or went, \n
Or on the fresh grass lay about. \n
Surely our youth at first had doubt \n
If 'twere not better to be gone \n
Than meet these stranger folk alone -- \n
But wot ye well such things as these \n
Were new to him born mid the trees \n
And wild things: and he thought, Maybe \n
The household of the Gods I see: \n
Who for as many tales as I \n
Have heard of them, I ne'er saw nigh. \n
If they be men, I wotted not \n
That such fair raiment men had got; \n
They will be glad to show them then. \n
For one thing taught these woodland men \n
Whatever wisdom they let fall \n
Men since have won Fear nought at all. \n
So from the holly brake he strode \n
Shouldering the while his hunter's load, \n
A new slain roe; but there arose \n
To meet him half a score of those \n
Whom in fair words he greeted well. \n
Now was he clad in a sheep's fell \n
And at his back his quiver hung, \n
His woodknife on his thigh: unstrung \n
His bow he held in a staff's stead. \n
An oaken wreath was round his head \n
From whence his crispy locks of brown \n
Well nigh unto his belt hung down, \n
And howso frank his eyes might be \n
A half-frown soothly might you see \n
As these men handled sword or spear \n
And cried out, "Hold, what dost thou here?" \n
"Ah," said he, "then no Gods ye are. \n
Fear not, I shall not make you war." \n
Therewith his hunting-knife he drew \n
And the long blade before them he threw. \n
Then loud they laughed; one sheathed his sword: \n
"Thanks, army-leader, for that word! \n
We are not Gods e'en as thou say'st, \n
Nor thou a devil of the waste \n
But e'en a devil's a friend belike." \n
Something [of] hate hereat did strike \n
Unto the woodsman's unused heart, \n
Yet he spake softly for his part: \n
"What men are ye and where dwell ye? \n
What is the wondrous house I see?" \n
"In the fair southland is our home \n
Yet from the north as now we come," \n
Said one: then with a mocking smile, \n
"And in our house there dwells awhile \n
A very Goddess of the north. \n
But lo you, take a thing of worth \n
For that thy quarry, and begone." \n
But as he spake another one \n
Spake softly in his ear: and so \n
The word from this to that did go, \n
With laughing that seemed nowise good \n
Unto the dweller of the wood, \n
Who saying nought moved toward the tent. \n
But they came round him as he went \n
And said: "Nay, pagan, stay thy feet; \n
Thou art not one our dame to greet \n
house \n
At the back of the houses there is the wood. \n
While there is a leaf of summer left, the wood \n
Makes sounds I can put somewhere in my song, \n
Has paths I can walk, when I wake, to good \n
Or evil: to the cage, to the oven, to the House \n
In the Wood. It is a part of life, or of the story \n
We make of life. But after the last leaf, \n
The last light--for each year is leafless, \n
Each day lightless, at the last--the wood begins \n
Its serious existence: it has no path, \n
No house, no story; it resists comparison... \n
One clear, repeated, lapping gurgle, like a spoon \n
Or a glass breathing, is the brook, \n
The wood's fouled midnight water. If I walk into the wood \n
As far as I can walk, I come to my own door, \n
The door of the House in the Wood. It opens silently: \n
On the bed is something covered, something humped \n
Asleep there, awake there--but what? I do not know. \n
I look, I lie there, and yet I do not know. \n
How far out my great echoing clumsy limbs \n
Stretch, surrounded only by space! For time has struck, \n
All the clocks are stuck now, for how many lives, \n
On the same second. Numbed, wooden, motionless, \n
We are far under the surface of the night. \n
Nothing comes down so deep but sound: a car, freight cars, \n
A high soft droning, drawn out like a wire \n
Forever and ever--is this the sound that Bunyan heard \n
So that he thought his bowels would burst within him?-- \n
Drift on, on, into nothing. Then someone screams \n
A scream like an old knife sharpened into nothing. \n
It is only a nightmare. No one wakes up, nothing happens, \n
Except there is gooseflesh over my whole body-- \n
And that too, after a little while, is gone. \n
I lie here like a cut-off limb, the stump the limb has left... \n
Here at the bottom of the world, what was before the world \n
And will be after, holds me to its back \n
Breasts and rocks me: the oven is cold, the cage is empty, \n
In the House in the Wood, the witch and her child sleep. \n<|endoftext|>
house \n
Here we broached the Christmas barrel, \n
Pushed up the charred log-ends; \n
Here we sang the Christmas carol, \n
And called in friends. \n
Time has tired me since we met here \n
When the folk now dead were young, \n
And the viands were outset here \n
And quaint songs sung. \n
And the worm has bored the viol \n
That used to lead the tune, \n
Rust eaten out the dial \n
That struck night's noon. \n
Now no Christmas brings in neighbours, \n
And the New Year comes unlit; \n
Where we sang the mole now labours, \n
And spiders knit. \n
Yet at midnight if here walking, \n
When the moon sheets wall and tree, \n
I see forms of old time talking, \n
Who smile on me. \n<|endoftext|>

Hope went by and Peace went by \n

Some were old and some were mad, \n

If you should look for this place after a handful \n

Perhaps of my planted forest a few \n
May stand yet, dark-leaved Australians or the coast \n

With storm-drift; but fire and the axe are devils. \n
Look for foundations of sea-worn granite, my fingers \n

To make stone love stone, you will find some remnant. \n

It is the granite knoll on the granite \n
And lava tongue in the midst of the bay, by the mouth \n
of the Carmel \n
River-valley, these four will remain \n
In the change of names. You will know it by the wild \n
sea-fragrance of wind \n
Though the ocean may have climbed or retired a little; \n
You will know it by the valley inland that our sun \n
and our moon were born from \n
Before the poles changed; and Orion in December \n
Evenings was strung in the throat of the valley like \n
a lamp-lighted bridge. \n
Come in the morning you will see white gulls \n
Weaving a dance over blue water, the wane of the moon \n
Their dance-companion, a ghost walking \n
By daylight, but wider and whiter than any bird in \n
the world. \n
My ghost you needn't look for; it is probably \n
Here, but a dark one, deep in the granite, not \n
dancing on wind \n
With the mad wings and the day moon. \n

That deaf old man \n
With his hand to his ear-- \n
His hand to hi head stood out like a shell, \n
Horny and hollow. He said, "I can't hear," \n
He muttered, "Don't shout, \n
I can hear very well!" \n
He mumbled, "I can't catch a word; \n

THE HOUSE \n
The cornerstone in Truth is laid, \n
The guardian walls of Honour made, \n
The roof of Faith is built above, \n
The fire upon the hearth is Love: \n
Though rains descend and loud winds call, \n
This happy house shall never fall. \n
THE DOORSTEAD \n
The lintel low enough to keep out pomp and pride: \n
The threshold high enough to turn deceit aside: \n
The doorband strong enough from robbers to defend: \n
This door will open at a touch to welcome every friend. \n
THE HEARTHSTONE \n
When the logs are burning free, \n

Light your fire and never fear, \n

house \n
Two lovers, here at the corner, by the steeple, \n
Two lovers blow together like music blowing: \n
And the crowd dissolves about them like a sea. \n
Recurring waves of sound break vaguely about them, \n
They drift from wall to wall, from tree to tree. \n
'Well, am I late?' Upward they look and laugh, \n
They look at the great clock's golden hands, \n
They laugh and talk, not knowing what they say: \n
Only, their words like music seem to play; \n
And seeming to walk, they tread strange sarabands. \n
'I brought you this . . . ' the soft words float like stars \n
Down the smooth heaven of her memory. \n
She stands again by a garden wall, \n
The peach tree is in bloom, pink blossoms fall, \n
Water sings from an opened tap, the bees \n
Glisten and murmur among the trees. \n
Someone calls from the house. She does not answer. \n
Backward she leans her head, \n
And dreamily smiles at the peach-tree leaves, wherethrough \n
She sees an infinite May sky spread \n
A vault profoundly blue. \n
The voice from the house fades far away, \n
The glistening leaves more vaguely ripple and sway . . \n
The tap is closed, the water ceases to hiss . . . \n
Silence . . . blue sky . . . and then, 'I brought you this . . . ' \n
She turns again, and smiles . . . He does not know \n
She smiles from long ago . . . \n
She turns to him and smiles . . . Sunlight above him \n
Roars like a vast invisible sea, \n
Gold is beaten before him, shrill bells of silver; \n
He is released of weight, his body is free, \n
He lifts his arms to swim, \n
Dark years like sinister tides coil under him . . . \n
The lazy sea-waves crumble along the beach \n
With a whirring sound like wind in bells, \n
He lies outstretched on the yellow wind-worn sands \n
Reaching his lazy hands \n
Among the golden grains and sea-white shells . . . \n
'One white rose . . . or is it pink, to-day?' \n
They pause and smile, not caring what they say, \n
If only they may talk. \n
The crowd flows past them like dividing waters. \n
Dreaming they stand, dreaming they walk. \n
'Pink,—to-day!'—Face turns to dream-bright face, \n
Green leaves rise round them, sunshine settles upon them, \n
Water, in drops of silver, falls from the rose. \n
She smiles at a face that smiles through leaves from the mirror. \n
She breathes the fragrance; her dark eyes close . . . \n
Time is dissolved, it blows like a little dust: \n
Time, like a flurry of rain, \n
Patters and passes, starring the window-pane. \n
Once, long ago, one night, \n
She saw the lightning, with long blue quiver of light, \n
Ripping the darkness . . . and as she turned in terror \n
A soft face leaned above her, leaned softly down, \n
Softly around her a breath of roses was blown, \n
She sank in waves of quiet, she seemed to float \n
In a sea of silence . . . and soft steps grew remote . . \n
'Well, let us walk in the park . . . The sun is warm, \n
We'll sit on a bench and talk . . .' They turn and glide, \n
The crowd of faces wavers and breaks and flows. \n
'Look how the oak-tops turn to gold in the sunlight! \n
Look how the tower is changed and glows!' \n
Two lovers move in the crowd like a link of music, \n
We press upon them, we hold them, and let them pass; \n
A chord of music strikes us and straight we tremble; \n
We tremble like wind-blown grass. \n
What was this dream we had, a dream of music, \n
Music that rose from the opening earth like magic \n
And shook its beauty upon us and died away? \n
The long cold streets extend once more before us. \n
The red sun drops, the walls grow grey. \n<|endoftext|>
house \n
From my cottage kitchen window I can see \n
Two fields away the blue, the shining sea \n
And ships that slowly glide to far-off shores \n
Each one a separate world with its own laws; \n
They pass beyond my window and are gone. \n
When morning comes that miracle, the sun \n
Lifts slowly from the sea, a sacrament \n
Of grace and glory, or enlightenment. \n
My cottage truly is a house of light: \n
By night shines Sirius, cold and bright \n
And in the afternoon our living room \n
Seems more like a sunny meadow in mid-June. \n
From it we see the sun prepare to slumber \n
Wrapped in the gleaming waters of the Humber \n
While to the south another lighthouse shines— \n
Peace be to Spurn and you who read these lines. \n<|endoftext|>
house \n
The snow floats down upon us, mingled with rain... \n
It eddies around pale lilac lamps, and falls \n
Down golden-windowed walls. \n
We were all born of flesh, in a flare of pain, \n
We do not remember the red roots whence we rose, \n
But we know that we rose and walked, that after a while \n
We shall lie down again. \n
The snow floats down upon us, we turn, we turn, \n
Through gorges filled with light we sound and flow... \n
One is struck down and hurt, we crowd about him, \n
We bear him away, gaze after his listless body; \n
But whether he lives or dies we do not know. \n
One of us sings in the street, and we listen to him; \n
The words ring over us like vague bells of sorrow. \n
He sings of a house he lived in long ago. \n
It is strange; this house of dust was the house I lived in; \n
The house you lived in, the house that all of us know. \n
And coiling slowly about him, and laughing at him, \n
And throwing him pennies, we bear away \n
A mournful echo of other times and places, \n
And follow a dream... a dream that will not stay. \n
Down long broad flights of lamplit stairs we flow; \n
Noisy, in scattered waves, crowding and shouting; \n
In broken slow cascades. \n
The gardens extend before us... We spread out swiftly; \n
Trees are above us, and darkness. The canyon fades... \n
And we recall, with a gleaming stab of sadness, \n
Vaguely and incoherently, some dream \n
Of a world we came from, a world of sun-blue hills... \n
A black wood whispers around us, green eyes gleam; \n
Someone cries in the forest, and someone kills. \n
We flow to the east, to the white-lined shivering sea; \n
We reach to the west, where the whirling sun went down; \n
We close our eyes to music in bright cafes. \n
We diverge from clamorous streets to streets that are silent. \n
We loaf where the wind-spilled fountain plays. \n
And, growing tired, we turn aside at last, \n
Remember our secret selves, seek out our towers, \n
Lay weary hands on the banisters, and climb; \n
Climbing, each, to his little four-square dream \n
Of love or lust or beauty or death or crime. \n<|endoftext|>
house \n
I turn around on the gravel \n
and go back to the house for a book, \n
something to read at the doctor’s office, \n
and while I am inside, running the finger \n
of inquisition along a shelf, \n
another me that did not bother \n
to go back to the house for a book \n
heads out on his own, \n
rolls down the driveway, \n
and swings left toward town, \n
a ghost in his ghost car, \n
another knot in the string of time, \n
a good three minutes ahead of me— \n
a spacing that will now continue \n
for the rest of my life. \n
Sometimes I think I see him \n
a few people in front of me on a line \n
or getting up from a table \n
to leave the restaurant just before I do, \n
slipping into his coat on the way out the door. \n
But there is no catching him, \n
no way to slow him down \n
and put us back in synch, \n
unless one day he decides to go back \n
to the house for something, \n
but I cannot imagine \n
for the life of me what that might be. \n
He is out there always before me, \n
blazing my trail, invisible scout, \n
hound that pulls me along, \n
shade I am doomed to follow, \n
my perfect double, \n
only bumped an inch into the future, \n
and not nearly as well-versed as I \n
in the love poems of Ovid— \n
I who went back to the house \n
that fateful winter morning and got the book. \n<|endoftext|>
house \n
I would build a cloudy House \n
For my thoughts to live in; \n
When for earth too fancy-loose \n
And too low for Heaven! \n
Hush! I talk my dream aloud--- \n
I build it bright to see,--- \n
I build it on the moonlit cloud, \n
To which I looked with thee. \n
Cloud-walls of the morning's grey, \n
Faced with amber column,--- \n
Crowned with crimson cupola \n
From a sunset solemn! \n
May mists, for the casements, fetch, \n
Pale and glimmering; \n
With a sunbeam hid in each, \n
And a smell of spring. \n
Build the entrance high and proud, \n
Darkening and then brightening,--- \n
If a riven thunder-cloud, \n
Veined by the lightning. \n
Use one with an iris-stain, \n
For the door within; \n
Turning to a sound like rain, \n
As I enter in. \n
Build a spacious hall thereby: \n
Boldly, never fearing. \n
Use the blue place of the sky, \n
Which the wind is clearing; \n
Branched with corridors sublime, \n
Flecked with winding stairs--- \n
Such as children wish to climb, \n
Following their own prayers. \n
In the mutest of the house, \n
I will have my chamber: \n
Silence at the door shall use \n
Evening's light of amber, \n
Solemnising every mood, \n
Softemng in degree,--- \n
Turning sadness into good, \n
As I turn the key. \n
Be my chamber tapestried \n
With the showers of summer, \n
Close, but soundless,---glorified \n
When the sunbeams come here; \n
Wandering harpers, harping on \n
Waters stringed for such,--- \n
Drawing colours, for a tune, \n
With a vibrant touch. \n
Bring a shadow green and still \n
From the chestnut forest, \n
Bring a purple from the hill, \n
When the heat is sorest; \n
Spread them out from wall to wall, \n
Carpet-wove around,--- \n
Whereupon the foot shall fall \n
In light instead of sound. \n
Bring the fantasque cloudlets home \n
From the noontide zenith \n
Ranged, for sculptures, round the room,--- \n
Named as Fancy weeneth: \n
Some be Junos, without eyes; \n
Naiads, without sources \n
Some be birds of paradise,--- \n
Some, Olympian horses. \n
Bring the dews the birds shake off, \n
Waking in the hedges,--- \n
Those too, perfumed for a proof, \n
From the lilies' edges: \n
From our England's field and moor, \n
Bring them calm and white in; \n
Whence to form a mirror pure, \n
For Love's self-delighting. \n
Bring a grey cloud from the east, \n
Where the lark is singing; \n
Something of the song at least, \n
Unlost in the bringing: \n
That shall be a morning chair, \n
Poet-dream may sit in, \n
When it leans out on the air, \n
Unrhymed and unwritten. \n
Bring the red cloud from the sun \n
While he sinketh, catch it. \n
That shall be a couch,---with one \n
Sidelong star to watch it,--- \n
Fit for poet's finest Thought, \n
At the curfew-sounding,--- ; \n
Things unseen being nearer brought \n
Than the seen, around him. \n
Poet's thought,----not poet's sigh! \n
'Las, they come together! \n
Cloudy walls divide and fly, \n
As in April weather! \n
Cupola and column proud, \n
Structure bright to see--- \n
Gone---except that moonlit cloud, \n
To which I looked with thee! \n
Let them! Wipe such visionings \n
From the Fancy's cartel--- \n
Love secures some fairer things \n
Dowered with his immortal. \n
The sun may darken,---heaven be bowed--- \n
But still, unchanged shall be,--- \n
Here in my soul,---that moonlit cloud, \n
To which I looked with THEE! \n<|endoftext|>
house \n
Love I was shewn upon the mountain-side \n
And bid to catch Him ere the dropp of day. \n
See, Love, I creep and Thou on wings dost ride: \n
Love it is evening now and Thou away; \n
Love, it grows darker here and Thou art above; \n
Love, come down to me if Thy name be Love. \n
My national old Egyptian reed gave way; \n
I took of vine a cross-barred rod or rood. \n
Then next I hungered: Love when here, they say, \n
Or once or never took love's proper food; \n
But I must yield the chase, or rest and eat. - \n
Peace and food cheered me where four rough ways meet. \n
Hear yet my paradox: Love, when all is given, \n
To see Thee I must [see] Thee, to love, love; \n
I must o'ertake Thee at once and under heaven \n
If I shall overtake Thee at last above. \n
You have your wish; enter these walls, one said: \n
He is with you in the breaking of the bread. \n<|endoftext|>

The sun is a beach ball covered in sand, \n
Warming up this little land. \n
It's been kicked into the blue sky, \n
By a boy on the beach, that kicked it too high. \n
It races you home, wherever you may be, \n
Who will win, you'll have to wait and see. \n<|endoftext|>

The sun has long been set, \n
The stars are out by twos and threes, \n
The little birds are piping yet \n
Among the bushes and the trees; \n
There's a cuckoo, and one or two thrushes, \n
And a far-off wind that rushes, \n
And a sound of water that gushes, \n
And the cuckoo's sovereign cry \n
Fills all the hollow of the sky. \n
Who would go `parading' \n
In London, `and masquerading', \n
On such a night of June \n
With that beautiful soft half-moon, \n
And all these innocent blisses? \n
On such a night as this is! \n<|endoftext|>

(for Kwame) \n
1 \n
It is mid-afternoon now, \n
the sun streaks slant wards \n
through the attic's double-glazing \n
melting the scorched ink \n
in my crowded note-book \n
that lies blanched \n
on the sparse weathered table. \n
Hardened sepia-stained lines \n
that once approximated to \n
a flock of metaphors, \n
now rearrange themselves \n
into a congregation of phrases, \n
a lineation of new line-breaks: \n
stops that defy \n
even the physics of refraction, \n
thoughts that now re-surface \n
and resurrect just as \n
passion and reverence did \n
within the folds of The Prophet. \n
2 \n
It is still mid-afternoon, \n
the blue blaze makes the pages \n
of my book flip over gently \n
in the invisible wind of silence. \n
The heat penetrating the glass \n
focuses even more fiercely \n
smoking out redolent similes, \n
questioning the whole point, \n
the nib of writing itself. \n
Underneath the permanent scar \n
of jet-black fluid and heat \n
is pulp, half-dead. \n
Beneath the persistent hoarse- \n
drone of metal-scratching \n
is bleached pulp, half-alive, \n
its cotton laid sheets \n
carefully encoded with \n
the magic arc of a gold-tip. \n
Words appear, and more \n
words. And under them all, \n
I discover much later, \n
a small spring insect \n
that lay mummified, \n
quietly crushed below \n
the weight of words, \n
its innocence and juice \n
trapped under oppression \n
of ambition and intellect, \n
baptised and bloodied. \n
3 \n
It is mid-afternoon, \n
and I too lie, dead- \n
still, blanched, bloodied. \n<|endoftext|>

The sun has set, and the long grass now \n
Waves dreamily in the evening wind; \n
And the wild bird has flown from that old gray stone \n
In some warm nook a couch to find. \n
In all the lonely landscape round \n
I see no light and hear no sound, \n
Except the wind that far away \n
Come sighing o'er the healthy sea. \n<|endoftext|>

Spread wide your light, \n

To shine more bright. \n
Welcome the dawn and so enhance the sky, \n
With colours that unite, \n
A vision there displayed, food for the eye, \n
Quick changing sight. \n
A new day now unfolds, and in its glow, \n
The scene is quite \n
Breathtaking. Subtle shades soft and mellow, \n
Just fine and right. \n
Pale morning sun, that rises, burn more strong, \n
And so invite, \n
Nature to call awake the melody of birdsong, \n
From out the night. \n<|endoftext|>

Beautiful Sun! with thy golden rays, \n
To God, the wise Creator, be all praise; \n
For thou nourisheth all the creation, \n
Wherever there is found to be animation. \n
Without thy heat we could not live, \n
Then praise to God we ought to give; \n
For thou makest the fruits and provisions to grow, \n
To nourish all creatures on earth below. \n
Thou makest the hearts of the old feel glad, \n
Likewise the young child and the lad, \n
And the face of Nature to look green and gay, \n
And the little children to sport and play. \n
Thou also givest light unto the Moon, \n
Which certainly is a very great boon \n
To all God's creatures here below, \n
Throughout the world where'er they go. \n
How beautiful thou look'st on a summer morn, \n
When thou sheddest thy effulgence among the yellow corn, \n
Also upon lake, and river, and the mountain tops, \n
Whilst thou leavest behind the most lovely dewdrops! \n
How beautiful thou seem'st in the firmament above, \n
As I gaze upon thee, my heart fills with love \n
To God, the great Creator, Who has placed thee there, \n
Who watches all His creatures with an eye of care! \n
Thou makest the birds to sing on the tree, \n
Also by meadow, mountain, and lea; \n
And the lark high poised up in air, \n
Carolling its little song with its heart free from care. \n
Thou makest the heart of the shepherd feel gay \n
As he watches the little lambkins at their innocent play; \n
While he tends them on the hillside all day, \n
Taking care that none of them shall go astray. \n
Thou cheerest the weary traveller while on his way \n
During the livelong summer day, \n
As he admires the beautiful scenery while passing along, \n
And singing to himself a stave of a song. \n
Thou cheerest the tourist while amongst the Highland hills, \n
As he views their beautiful sparkling rills \n
Glittering like diamonds by the golden rays, \n
While the hills seem to offer up to God their praise. \n
While the bee from flower to flower does roam \n
To gather honey, and carry it home; \n
While it hums its little song in the beautiful sunshine, \n
And seemingly to thank the Creator divine -- \n
For the honey it hath gathered during the day, \n
In the merry month of May, \n
When the flowers are in full bloom, \n
Also the sweet honeysuckle and the broom. \n
How beautiful thy appearance while setting in the west, \n
Whilst encircled with red and azure, 'tis then thou look'st best! \n
Then let us all thank God for thy golden light \n
In our prayers every morning and night! \n<|endoftext|>

Give me to warble spontaneous songs, reliev'd, recluse by myself, for \n
my own ears only; 10 \n
Give me solitude--give me Nature--give me again, O Nature, your \n
primal sanities! \n

and rack'd by the war-strife;) \n
These to procure, incessantly asking, rising in cries from my heart, \n
While yet incessantly asking, still I adhere to my city; \n
Day upon day, and year upon year, O city, walking your streets, \n
Where you hold me enchain'd a certain time, refusing to give me up; \n
Yet giving to make me glutted, enrich'd of soul--you give me forever \n
faces; \n
(O I see what I sought to escape, confronting, reversing my cries; \n
I see my own soul trampling down what it ask'd for.) \n
Keep your splendid, silent sun; 20 \n

Keep your fields of clover and timothy, and your corn-fields and \n
orchards; \n
Keep the blossoming buckwheat fields, where the Ninth-month bees hum; \n
Give me faces and streets! give me these phantoms incessant and \n
endless along the trottoirs! \n
Give me interminable eyes! give me women! give me comrades and lovers \n
by the thousand! \n
Let me see new ones every day! let me hold new ones by the hand every \n
day! \n
Give me such shows! give me the streets of Manhattan! \n
Give me Broadway, with the soldiers marching--give me the sound of \n
the trumpets and drums! \n
(The soldiers in companies or regiments--some, starting away, flush'd \n
and reckless; \n
Some, their time up, returning, with thinn'd ranks--young, yet very \n
old, worn, marching, noticing nothing;) 30 \n
--Give me the shores and the wharves heavy-fringed with the black \n
ships! \n
O such for me! O an intense life! O full to repletion, and varied! \n
The life of the theatre, bar-room, huge hotel, for me! \n
The saloon of the steamer! the crowded excursion for me! the torch- \n
light procession! \n
The dense brigade, bound for the war, with high piled military wagons \n
following; \n
People, endless, streaming, with strong voices, passions, pageants; \n
Manhattan streets, with their powerful throbs, with the beating \n
drums, as now; \n
The endless and noisy chorus, the rustle and clank of muskets, (even \n
the sight of the wounded;) \n
Manhattan crowds, with their turbulent musical chorus--with varied \n
chorus, and light of the sparkling eyes; \n
Manhattan faces and eyes forever for me. 40 \n<|endoftext|>
winter \n
Above the marge of night a star still shines, \n
And on the frosty hills the sombre pines \n
Harbor an eerie wind that crooneth low \n
Over the glimmering wastes of virgin snow. \n
Through the pale arch of orient the morn \n
Comes in a milk-white splendor newly-born, \n
A sword of crimson cuts in twain the gray \n
Banners of shadow hosts, and lo, the day! \n<|endoftext|>
winter \n
LIKE the vulture \n
Who on heavy morning clouds \n
With gentle wing reposing \n
Looks for his prey,-- \n
Hover, my song! \n
For a God hath \n
Unto each prescribed \n
His destined path, \n
Which the happy one \n
Runs o'er swiftly \n
To his glad goal: \n
He whose heart cruel \n
Fate hath contracted, \n
Struggles but vainly \n
Against all the barriers \n
The brazen thread raises, \n
But which the harsh shears \n
Must one day sever. \n
Through gloomy thickets \n
Presseth the wild deer on, \n
And with the sparrows \n
Long have the wealthy \n
Settled themselves in the marsh. \n
Easy 'tis following the chariot \n
That by Fortune is driven, \n
Like the baggage that moves \n
Over well-mended highways \n
After the train of a prince. \n
But who stands there apart? \n
In the thicket, lost is his path; \n
Behind him the bushes \n
Are closing together, \n
The grass springs up again, \n
The desert engulphs him. \n
Ah, who'll heal his afflictions, \n
To whom balsam was poison, \n
Who, from love's fullness, \n
Drank in misanthropy only? \n
First despised, and now a despiser, \n
He, in secret, wasteth \n
All that he is worth, \n
In a selfishness vain. \n
If there be, on thy psaltery, \n
Father of Love, but one tone \n
That to his ear may be pleasing, \n
Oh, then, quicken his heart! \n
Clear his cloud-enveloped eyes \n
Over the thousand fountains \n
Close by the thirsty one \n
In the desert. \n
Thou who createst much joy, \n
For each a measure o'erflowing, \n
Bless the sons of the chase \n
When on the track of the prey, \n
With a wild thirsting for blood, \n
Youthful and joyous \n
Avenging late the injustice \n
Which the peasant resisted \n
Vainly for years with his staff. \n
But the lonely one veil \n
Within thy gold clouds! \n
Surround with winter-green, \n
Until the roses bloom again, \n
The humid locks, \n
Oh Love, of thy minstrel! \n
With thy glimmering torch \n
Lightest thou him \n
Through the fords when 'tis night, \n
Over bottomless places \n
On desert-like plains; \n
With the thousand colours of morning \n
Gladd'nest his bosom; \n
With the fierce-biting storm \n
Bearest him proudly on high; \n
Winter torrents rush from the cliffs,-- \n
Blend with his psalms; \n
An altar of grateful delight \n
He finds in the much-dreaded mountain's \n
Snow-begirded summit, \n
Which foreboding nations \n
Crown'd with spirit-dances. \n
Thou stand'st with breast inscrutable, \n
Mysteriously disclosed, \n
High o'er the wondering world, \n
And look'st from clouds \n
Upon its realms and its majesty, \n
Which thou from the veins of thy brethren \n
Near thee dost water. \n<|endoftext|>

Twice a week the winter thorough \n
Here stood I to keep the goal: \n
Football then was fighting sorrow \n
For the young man's soul. \n
Now in Maytime to the wicket \n
Out I march with bat and pad: \n
See the son of grief at cricket \n
Trying to be glad. \n
Try I will; no harm in trying: \n
Wonder 'tis how little mirth \n
Keeps the bones of man from lying \n
On the bed of earth. \n<|endoftext|>

The city is closing for the night. \n
Stores draw their blinds one by one, \n
and it's dark again, save for the dim \n
infrequent streetlight bending at the neck \n
like a weighted stem. Years have built \n
the city in layers: balustrades filled in \n
with brick, adobe reinforced with steel, \n
and the rounded arches smoothed \n
with white cement. Neighborhoods \n
have changed the burro trails \n
to streets, bare at night— \n
no pedestrians, no cars, no dogs. \n
With daylight, the houses turned galleries \n
and stores turned restaurants open— \n
the Navajos wrapped in wool \n
crowd the Palace of the Governors plaza \n
to sell their handmade blankets, \n
silver rings, and necklaces \n
to travelers who will buy jewelry \n
as they buy everything— \n
another charming history for themselves. \n<|endoftext|>

Hello Winter, hello flanneled \n
blanket of clouds, clouds \n
fueled by more clouds, hello again. \n
Hello afternoons, \n
off to the west, that silver \n
of sunset, rust-colored \n
and gone too soon. \n
And night (I admit to a short memory) \n
you climb back in with chilly fingers \n
and clocks, and there is no refusal: \n
ice cracks the water main, the garden hose \n
stiffens, the bladed leaves of the rhododendron \n
shine in the fog of a huge moon. \n
And rain, street lacquer, \n
oily puddles and spinning rubber, \n
mist of angels on the head of a pin, \n
hello, \n

white, freon scent, you build \n
even as you empty the world of texture- \n
hello to this new relief, \n
this new solitude now upon us, \n
upon which we feed. \n<|endoftext|>
winter \n
All night the wind swept over the house \n
And through our dream \n
Swirling the snow up through the pines, \n
Ruffling the white, ice-capped clapboards, \n
Rattling the windows, \n
Rustling around and below our bed \n
So that we rode \n
Over wild water \n
In a white ship breasting the waves. \n
We rode through the night \n
On green, marbled \n
Water, and, half-waking, watched \n
The white, eroded peaks of icebergs \n
Sail past our windows; \n
Rode out the night in that north country, \n
And awoke, the house buried in snow, \n
Perched on a \n
Chill promontory, a \n
Giant's tooth \n
In the mouth of the cold valley, \n
Its white tongue looped frozen around us, \n
The trunks of tall birches \n
Revealing the rib cage of a whale \n
Stranded by a still stream; \n
And saw, through the motionless baleen of their branches, \n
As if through time, \n
Light that shone \n
On a landscape of ivory, \n
A harbor of bone. \n<|endoftext|>

Late lies the wintry sun a-bed, \n
A frosty, fiery sleepy-head; \n
Blinks but an hour or two; and then, \n
A blood-red orange, sets again. \n
Before the stars have left the skies, \n
At morning in the dark I rise; \n
And shivering in my nakedness, \n
By the cold candle, bathe and dress. \n
Close by the jolly fire I sit \n
To warm my frozen bones a bit; \n
Or with a reindeer-sled, explore \n
The colder countries round the door. \n
When to go out, my nurse doth wrap \n
Me in my comforter and cap; \n
The cold wind burns my face, and blows \n
Its frosty pepper up my nose. \n
Black are my steps on silver sod; \n
Thick blows my frosty breath abroad; \n
And tree and house, and hill and lake, \n
Are frosted like a wedding cake. \n<|endoftext|>
winter \n
Some day, when trees have shed their leaves \n
And against the morning's white \n
The shivering birds beneath the eaves \n
Have sheltered for the night, \n
We'll turn our faces southward, love, \n
Toward the summer isle \n
Where bamboos spire to shafted grove \n
And wide-mouthed orchids smile. \n
And we will seek the quiet hill \n
Where towers the cotton tree, \n
And leaps the laughing crystal rill, \n
And works the droning bee. \n
And we will build a cottage there \n
Beside an open glade, \n
With black-ribbed blue-bells blowing near, \n
And ferns that never fade. \n<|endoftext|>

winter \n
When snow falls against the window, \n
Long sounds the evening bell... \n
For so many has the table \n
Been prepared, the house set in order. \n
From their wandering, many \n
Come on dark paths to this gateway. \n
The tree of grace is flowering in gold \n
Out of the cool sap of the earth. \n
In stillness, wanderer, step in: \n
Grief has worn the threshold into stone. \n
But see: in pure light, glowing \n
There on the table: bread and wine. \n<|endoftext|>

"Blow, blow, thou winter wind." \n
Away from here, \n
And I shall greet thy passing breath \n
Without a tear. \n
I do not love thy snow and sleet \n
Or icy flows; \n
When I must jump or stamp to warm \n
My freezing toes. \n
For why should I be happy or \n
E'en be merry, \n
In weather only fitted for \n
Cook or Peary. \n
My eyes are red, my lips are blue \n
My ears frost bitt'n; \n
Thy numbing kiss doth e'en extend \n
Thro' my mitten. \n
I am cold, no matter how I warm \n
Or clothe me; \n
O Winter, greater bards have sung \n
I loathe thee! \n<|endoftext|>
winter \n
The half-stripped trees \n
struck by a wind together, \n
bending all, \n
the leaves flutter drily \n
and refuse to let go \n
or driven like hail \n

and fall \n
where the salvias, hard carmine-- \n

edge the bare garden. \n<|endoftext|>
winter \n
There is one story and one story only \n
That will prove worth your telling, \n
Whether as learned bard or gifted child; \n
To it all lines or lesser gauds belong \n
That startle with their shining \n
Such common stories as they stray into. \n
Is it of trees you tell, their months and virtues, \n
Or strange beasts that beset you, \n
Of birds that croak at you the Triple will? \n
Or of the Zodiac and how slow it turns \n
Below the Boreal Crown, \n
Prison to all true kings that ever reigned? \n
Water to water, ark again to ark, \n
From woman back to woman: \n
So each new victim treads unfalteringly \n
The never altered circuit of his fate, \n
Bringing twelve peers as witness \n
Both to his starry rise and starry fall. \n
Or is it of the Virgin's silver beauty, \n
All fish below the thighs? \n
She in her left hand bears a leafy quince; \n
When, with her right hand she crooks a finger, smiling, \n
How many the King hold back? \n
Royally then he barters life for love. \n
Or of the undying snake from chaos hatched, \n
Whose coils contain the ocean, \n
Into whose chops with naked sword he springs, \n
Then in black water, tangled by the reeds, \n
Battles three days and nights, \n
To be spewed up beside her scalloped shore? \n
Much snow is falling, winds roar hollowly, \n
The owl hoots from the elder, \n
Fear in your heart cries to the loving-cup: \n
Sorrow to sorrow as the sparks fly upward. \n
The log groans and confesses: \n
There is one story and one story only. \n
Dwell on her graciousness, dwell on her smiling, \n
Do not forget what flowers \n
The great boar trampled down in ivy time. \n
Her brow was creamy as the crested wave, \n
Her sea-blue eyes were wild \n
But nothing promised that is not performed. \n<|endoftext|>

When you startle awake in the dark morning \n
heart pounding breathing fast \n
sitting bolt upright staring into \n
dark whirlpool black hole \n
feeling its suction \n
Get out of bed \n
knock at the door of your nearest friend \n
ask to lie down ask to be held \n
Listen while whispered words \n
turn the hole into deep night sky \n
stars close together \n
winter moon rising over white fields \n
nearby wren rustling dry leaves \n
distant owl echoing \n

Let your soul laugh \n
let your heart sigh out \n

so swollen in your throat \n
Already light is returning pairs of wings \n

Sweet life! how lovely to be here \n
And feel the soft sea-laden breeze \n
Strike my flushed face, the spruce's fair \n
Free limbs to see, the lesser trees' \n
Bare hands to touch, the sparrow's cheep \n
To heed, and watch his nimble flight \n
Above the short brown grass asleep. \n
Love glorious in his friendly might, \n
Music that every heart could bless, \n
And thoughts of life serene, divine, \n
Beyond my power to express, \n
Crowd round this lifted heart of mine! \n
But oh! to leave this paradise \n
For the city's dirty basement room, \n
Where, beauty hidden from the eyes, \n
A table, bed, bureau, and broom \n
In corner set, two crippled chairs \n
All covered up with dust and grim \n
With hideousness and scars of years, \n
And gaslight burning weird and dim, \n
Will welcome me . . . And yet, and yet \n
This very wind, the winter birds \n
The glory of the soft sunset, \n
Come there to me in words. \n<|endoftext|>

THEE for my recitative! \n
Thee in the driving storm, even as now--the snow--the winter-day \n
declining; \n
Thee in thy panoply, thy measured dual throbbing, and thy beat \n
convulsive; \n
Thy black cylindric body, golden brass, and silvery steel; \n
Thy ponderous side-bars, parallel and connecting rods, gyrating, \n
shuttling at thy sides; \n
Thy metrical, now swelling pant and roar--now tapering in the \n
distance; \n
Thy great protruding head-light, fix'd in front; \n
Thy long, pale, floating vapor-pennants, tinged with delicate purple; \n
The dense and murky clouds out-belching from thy smoke-stack; \n
Thy knitted frame--thy springs and valves--the tremulous twinkle of \n
thy wheels; 10 \n
Thy train of cars behind, obedient, merrily-following, \n
Through gale or calm, now swift, now slack, yet steadily careering: \n
Type of the modern! emblem of motion and power! pulse of the \n
continent! \n
For once, come serve the Muse, and merge in verse, even as here I see \n
thee, \n
With storm, and buffeting gusts of wind, and falling snow; \n
By day, thy warning, ringing bell to sound its notes, \n
By night, thy silent signal lamps to swing. \n
Fierce-throated beauty! \n
Roll through my chant, with all thy lawless music! thy swinging lamps \n
at night; \n
Thy piercing, madly-whistled laughter! thy echoes, rumbling like an \n
earthquake, rousing all! 20 \n
Law of thyself complete, thine own track firmly holding; \n
(No sweetness debonair of tearful harp or glib piano thine,) \n
Thy trills of shrieks by rocks and hills return'd, \n
Launch'd o'er the prairies wide--across the lakes, \n
To the free skies, unpent, and glad, and strong. \n<|endoftext|>

The truth is dark under your eyelids. \n
What are you going to do about it? \n
The birds are silent; there's no one to ask. \n
All day long you'll squint at the gray sky. \n
When the wind blows you'll shiver like straw. \n
A meek little lamb you grew your wool \n
Till they came after you with huge shears. \n
Flies hovered over open mouth, \n
Then they, too, flew off like the leaves, \n
The bare branches reached after them in vain. \n
Winter coming. Like the last heroic soldier \n
Of a defeated army, you'll stay at your post, \n
Head bared to the first snow flake. \n
Till a neighbor comes to yell at you, \n
You're crazier than the weather, Charlie. \n<|endoftext|>

The schoolboys still their morning ramble take \n
To neighboring village school with playing speed, \n
Loitering with passtime's leisure till they quake, \n
Oft looking up the wild-geese droves to heed, \n
Watching the letters which their journeys make; \n
Or plucking haws on which their fieldfares feed, \n
And hips and sloes; and on each shallow lake \n
Making glib slides, where they like shadows go \n
Till some fresh passtimes in their minds awake. \n
Then off they start anew and hasty blow \n
Their numbed and clumpsing fingers till they glow; \n
Then races with their shadows wildly run \n
That stride huge giants o'er the shining snow \n
In the pale splendour of the winter sun. \n<|endoftext|>

I ask'd you leave, you bade me love; is 't now a time to chide me? \n
No, no, no, I'll love you still what fortune e'er betide me. \n

Freedom of speech \n
Freedom of thought \n
Freedom of creativity \n
Freedom of imagination \n
Music is ever soothingly healing \n
A bombardment of on-going expression of feelings \n
Music is a tool of unity \n
Always bringing people together as family \n
Hence be described as a mentor of spirituality \n
Music is magic \n
Performing its tricks \n
With sweet instrumental tones and lyrics \n
Music is emotionally captivating \n
Music is positively distracting \n
Music is a form of beautiful art \n
Passed on as a message on a public stage \n
Music is as powerful as water \n
Flowing in and out of generations \n
Trapped ever so often only by its own enormous power \n
Music is an angel \n
Singing out from the skies as she flies \n
Music is love \n
Music is the food of all moods \n
Music is perfect and it is good for you \n

I have a friend who still believes in heaven. \n
Not a stupid person, yet with all she knows, she literally talks to God. \n
She thinks someone listens in heaven. \n
On earth she's unusually competent. \n
Brave too, able to face unpleasantness. \n
We found a caterpillar dying in the dirt, greedy ants crawling over it. \n
I'm always moved by disaster, always eager to oppose vitality \n
But timid also, quick to shut my eyes. \n
Whereas my friend was able to watch, to let events play out \n
According to nature. For my sake she intervened \n
Brushing a few ants off the torn thing, and set it down \n
Across the road. \n
My friend says I shut my eyes to God, that nothing else explains \n
My aversion to reality. She says I'm like the child who \n
Buries her head in the pillow \n
So as not to see, the child who tells herself \n
That light causes sadness- \n
My friend is like the mother. Patient, urging me \n
To wake up an adult like herself, a courageous person- \n
In my dreams, my friend reproaches me. We're walking \n
On the same road, except it's winter now; \n
She's telling me that when you love the world you hear celestial music: \n
Look up, she says. When I look up, nothing. \n
Only clouds, snow, a white business in the trees \n
Like brides leaping to a great height- \n
Then I'm afraid for her; I see her \n
Caught in a net deliberately cast over the earth- \n
In reality, we sit by the side of the road, watching the sun set; \n
From time to time, the silence pierced by a birdcall. \n
It's this moment we're trying to explain, the fact \n
That we're at ease with death, with solitude. \n
My friend draws a circle in the dirt; inside, the caterpillar doesn't move. \n
She's always trying to make something whole, something beautiful, an image \n
Capable of life apart from her. \n
We're very quiet. It's peaceful sitting here, not speaking, The composition \n
Fixed, the road turning suddenly dark, the air \n
Going cool, here and there the rocks shining and glittering- \n
It's this stillness we both love. \n
The love of form is a love of endings. \n<|endoftext|>

Dead things with inbreath'd sense able to pierce, \n

With Saintly shout and solemn Jubilee, \n
Where the bright Seraphim in burning row \n
Their loud up-lifted Angel trumpets blow, \n
And the Cherubic host in thousand choirs \n
Touch their immortal Harps of golden wires, \n
With those just Spirits that wear victorious Palms, \n
Hymns devout and holy Psalms \n
Singing everlastingly; \n
That we on Earth with undiscording voice \n
May rightly answer that melodious noise; \n
As once we did, till disproportion'd sin \n
Jarr'd against Nature's chime, and with harsh din \n
Broke the fair music that all creatures made \n
To their great Lord, whose love their motion sway'd \n
In first obedience, and their state of good. \n
And keep in tune with Heav'n, till God ere long \n
To His celestial consort us unite, \n

quiet \n
I hardly heard you \n
tiptoe silently in \n
settle yourself \n
amongst the strings \n
talking to me \n
now in cello \n
now in violin \n
the heartbeat of a drum \n
the exchange of laughter \n
between glockenspiel & xylophone \n
making a point \n
with either \n
the tiny tinkle \n
of a triangle \n
or the crash of a symbol. \n
I listen to you talk \n
to me in music \n
the candlelight \n
grows dim & then \n
as softly as you came \n
you leave \n
leaves \n

I feel you leave \n

music \n
But Music cures in ways akin to drugs; \n
Enchanting mind, delighting the hearer; \n
And lulls a child to sleep as mother hugs, \n
Rejuvenates the wearied work better. \n
And calms the nerves and soothens broken heart, \n
Evoking emotions of any type; \n
Music has destressing effect in part; \n
But hymns create a ho1iness and hype. \n
And Music heals the body parts as such, \n
Removing pain, relaxing muscles well; \n
Its rhythm helps the breathing pattern much, \n
Its magic holds man, beasts, plants under spell! \n
Yet, Music has lesser side-effects used; \n
And keeps the patient, Doctor both amused. \n<|endoftext|>
music \n
Sister and mother and diviner love, \n
And of the sisterhood of the living dead \n
Most near, most clear, and of the clearest bloom, \n
And of the fragrant mothers the most dear \n
And queen, and of diviner love the day \n
And flame and summer and sweet fire, no thread \n
Of cloudy silver sprinkles in your gown \n
Its venom of renown, and on your head \n
No crown is simpler than the simple hair. \n
Now, of the music summoned by the birth \n
That separates us from the wind and sea, \n
Yet leaves us in them, until earth becomes, \n
By being so much of the things we are, \n
Gross effigy and simulacrum, none \n
Gives motion to perfection more serene \n
Than yours, out of our own imperfections wrought, \n
Most rare, or ever of more kindred air \n
In the laborious weaving that you wear. \n
For so retentive of themselves are men \n
That music is intensest which proclaims \n
The near, the clear, and vaunts the clearest bloom, \n
And of all the vigils musing the obscure, \n
That apprehends the most which sees and names, \n
As in your name, an image that is sure, \n
Among the arrant spices of the sun, \n
O bough and bush and scented vine, in whom \n
We give ourselves our likest issuance. \n
Yet not too like, yet not so like to be \n
Too near, too clear, saving a little to endow \n
Our feigning with the strange unlike, whence springs \n
The difference that heavenly pity brings. \n
For this, musician, in your girdle fixed \n
Bear other perfumes. On your pale head wear \n
A band entwining, set with fatal stones. \n
Unreal, give back to us what once you gave: \n
The imagination that we spurned and crave. \n

I keep such music in my brain \n
No din this side of death can quell; \n
Glory exulting over pain, \n
And beauty, garlanded in hell. \n
My dreaming spirit will not heed \n
The roar of guns that would destroy \n
My life that on the gloom can read \n
Proud-surging melodies of joy. \n
To the world’s end I went, and found \n
Death in his carnival of glare; \n
But in my torment I was crowned, \n
And music dawned above despair. \n<|endoftext|>

Now that I am without you, all is desolate; \n
All that was once so beautiful is dead. \n
Your hands once touched this table and this silver, \n
And I have seen your fingers hold this glass. \n
These things do not remember you, beloved, \n
And yet your touch upon them will not pass. \n
For it was in my heart that you moved among them, \n
And blessed them with your hands and with your eyes; \n
And in my heart they will remember always, \n
—They knew you once, O beautiful and wise. \n<|endoftext|>

Music is a door, \n
An escape to a different world. \n
A world you make and controll in your mind. \n
Music is a hero, \n
One to cheer your spirits when you are down. \n
Music is an enemy, \n
sometimes the lyrics bring you down. \n
Music is your personality, \n
expressed through song. \n
The music player, \n
Is you, the one holding it all together. \n
Music is an awakening to the real world. \n
Its lyrics are real and true. \n
Music is a best friend, \n
One to give advice when you need it. \n
Music is what you think of it. \n
Its starts off empty and colorless, \n
and escalates to something more, \n
your own world. \n<|endoftext|>
music \n
Music I love -­ but never strain \n
Could kindle raptures so divine, \n
So grief assuage, so conquer pain, \n
And rouse this pensive heart of mine -­ \n
As that we hear on Christmas morn, \n
Upon the wintry breezes borne. \n
Though Darkness still her empire keep, \n
And hours must pass, ere morning break; \n
From troubled dreams, or slumbers deep, \n
That music kindly bids us wake: \n
It calls us, with an angel's voice, \n
To wake, and worship, and rejoice; \n
To greet with joy the glorious morn, \n
Which angels welcomed long ago, \n
When our redeeming Lord was born, \n
To bring the light of Heaven below; \n
The Powers of Darkness to dispel, \n
And rescue Earth from Death and Hell. \n
While listening to that sacred strain, \n
My raptured spirit soars on high; \n
I seem to hear those songs again \n
Resounding through the open sky, \n
That kindled such divine delight, \n
In those who watched their flocks by night. \n
With them, I celebrate His birth -­ \n
Glory to God, in highest Heaven, \n
Good-will to men, and peace on Earth, \n
To us a Saviour-king is given; \n
Our God is come to claim His own, \n
And Satan's power is overthrown! \n
A sinless God, for sinful men, \n
Descends to suffer and to bleed; \n
Hell must renounce its empire then; \n
The price is paid, the world is freed, \n
And Satan's self must now confess, \n
That Christ has earned a Right to bless: \n
Now holy Peace may smile from heaven, \n
And heavenly Truth from earth shall spring: \n
The captive's galling bonds are riven, \n
For our Redeemer is our king; \n
And He that gave his blood for men \n
Will lead us home to God again. \n

Of silence, and assuages thought. \n
O lay your lips against your hand \n
And let me feel your breath through it, \n
While through the sense your song shall fit \n
The soul to understand. \n
The music lives upon my brain \n
Between your hands within mine eyes; \n
It stirs your lifted throat like pain, \n
An aching pulse of melodies. \n
Lean nearer, let the music pause: \n
The soul may better understand \n
Your music, shadowed in your hand \n
Now while the song withdraws. \n<|endoftext|>

I. Insomnia \n
The bulb at the front door burns and burns. \n
If it were a white rose it would tire of blooming \n
through another endless night. \n
The moon knows the routine; \n
it beats the bushes from east to west \n
and sets empty-handed. Again the one \n
she is waiting for has outrun the moon. \n
II. Old Money \n
The spotted hands shake as they polish the coins. \n
The shiny penny goes under the tongue, \n
the two silver pieces \n
weighted by pyramids \n
will shut down the eyes. \n
All the rest is paper, \n
useless in any world but this. \n
III. Home Movie \n
She knows that walk, that whistle, that knock. \n
It's the black wolf who sticks \n
his floured paw underneath the door. \n
She tries not to open. One look at his face \n
and she'll drop the gun. He will pick it up \n
and turn it on her where she waits, \n
her eyes shining, her hands over her head. \n
IV. Golden Boy \n
Whitewashed, the eyes refuse you. \n
And so the mouth must be serene, \n
the muscles play, the body \n
take an easy stance \n
to divert you from the two \n
boarded-up chambers \n
where someone has died. \n
V. Washing Day \n
Each year her laundry line gets lighter. \n
One by one they disappear, \n
ten little Indians. They take their socks, \n
their jeans, their stiff plaid shirts. \n
Above the Ford on its concrete blocks, \n
striped and zippered, \n
her cotton dress flutters on and on. \n<|endoftext|>

'Tis the spring joy that has no why or how, \n
But sees the sun and hopes not nor can fear-- \n
Spring is so sweet and spring seems all the year. \n
Dear voice, the first-come birds but trill as thou. \n
Oh music of my heart, be thus for long: \n
Too soon the spring bird learns the later song; \n
Too soon a sadder sweetness slays content \n
Too soon! There comes new light on onward day, \n
There comes new perfume o'er a rosier way: \n
Comes not again the young spring joy that went. \n<|endoftext|>

The music has its own story that plays with amazing emotions \n

Let it be symphony, classic, jazz or hard rock \n
but everyone loves music which has only one language \n
in this universe that has known as Sound of Music. \n
Anyone who has no interest themselves in music \n

Heed me, feed me, I am hungry, I am red-tongued with desire; \n
Boughs of balsam, slabs of cedar, gummy fagots of the pine, \n
Heap them on me, let me hug them to my eager heart of fire, \n
Roaring, soaring up to heaven as a symbol and a sign. \n
Bring me knots of sunny maple, silver birch and tamarack; \n
Leaping, sweeping, I will lap them with my ardent wings of flame; \n
I will kindle them to glory, I will beat the darkness back; \n
Streaming, gleaming, I will goad them to my glory and my fame. \n
Bring me gnarly limbs of live-oak, aid me in my frenzied fight; \n
Strips of iron-wood, scaly blue-gum, writhing redly in my hold; \n
With my lunge of lurid lances, with my whips that flail the night, \n
They will burgeon into beauty, they will foliate in gold. \n
Let me star the dim sierras, stab with light the inland seas; \n
Roaming wind and roaring darkness! seek no mercy at my hands; \n
I will mock the marly heavens, lamp the purple prairies, \n
I will flaunt my deathless banners down the far, unhouseled lands. \n
In the vast and vaulted pine-gloom where the pillared forests frown, \n
By the sullen, bestial rivers running where God only knows, \n
On the starlit coral beaches when the combers thunder down, \n
In the death-spell of the barrens, in the shudder of the snows; \n
In a blazing belt of triumph from the palm-leaf to the pine, \n
As a symbol of defiance lo! the wilderness I span; \n
And my beacons burn exultant as an everlasting sign \n
Of unending domination, of the mastery of Man; \n
I, the Life, the fierce Uplifter, I that weaned him from the mire; \n
I, the angel and the devil, I, the tyrant and the slave; \n
I, the Spirit of the Struggle; I, the mighty God of Fire; \n
I, the Maker and Destroyer; I, the Giver and the Grave. \n

Gather round me, boy and grey-beard, frontiersman of every kind. \n
Few are you, and far and lonely, yet an army forms behind: \n
By your camp-fires shall they know you, ashes scattered to the wind. \n
Peer into my heart of solace, break your bannock at my blaze; \n
Smoking, stretched in lazy shelter, build your castles as you gaze; \n
Or, it may be, deep in dreaming, think of dim, unhappy days. \n
Let my warmth and glow caress you, for your trails are grim and hard; \n
Let my arms of comfort press you, hunger-hewn and battle-scarred: \n
O my lovers! how I bless you with your lives so madly marred! \n
For you seek the silent spaces, and their secret lore you glean: \n
For you win the savage races, and the brutish Wild you wean; \n
And I gladden desert places, where camp-fire has never been. \n
From the Pole unto the Tropics is there trail ye have not dared? \n
And because you hold death lightly, so by death shall you be spared, \n
(As the sages of the ages in their pages have declared). \n
On the roaring Arkilinik in a leaky bark canoe; \n
Up the cloud of Mount McKinley, where the avalanche leaps through; \n
In the furnace of Death Valley, when the mirage glimmers blue. \n
Now a smudge of wiry willows on the weary Kuskoquim; \n
Now a flare of gummy pine-knots where Vancouver's scaur is grim; \n
Now a gleam of sunny ceiba, when the Cuban beaches dim. \n
Always, always God's Great Open: lo! I burn with keener light \n
In the corridors of silence, in the vestibules of night; \n
'Mid the ferns and grasses gleaming, was there ever gem so bright? \n
Not for weaklings, not for women, like my brother of the hearth; \n
Ring your songs of wrath around me, I was made for manful mirth, \n
In the lusty, gusty greatness, on the bald spots of the earth. \n
Men, my masters! men, my lovers! ye have fought and ye have bled; \n
Gather round my ruddy embers, softly glowing is my bed; \n
By my heart of solace dreaming, rest ye and be comforted! \n
III \n
I am dying, O my masters! by my fitful flame ye sleep; \n
My purple plumes of glory droop forlorn. \n
Grey ashes choke and cloak me, and above the pines there creep \n
The stealthy silver moccasins of morn. \n
There comes a countless army, it's the Legion of the Light; \n
It tramps in gleaming triumph round the world; \n
And before its jewelled lances all the shadows of the night \n
Back in to abysmal darknesses are hurled. \n
Leap to life again, my lovers! ye must toil and never tire; \n
The day of daring, doing, brightens clear, \n
When the bed of spicy cedar and the jovial camp-fire \n
Must only be a memory of cheer. \n
There is hope and golden promise in the vast portentous dawn; \n
There is glamour in the glad, effluent sky: \n
Go and leave me; I will dream of you and love you when you're gone; \n
I have served you, O my masters! let me die. \n
A little heap of ashes, grey and sodden by the rain, \n
Wind-scattered, blurred and blotted by the snow: \n
Let that be all to tell of me, and glorious again, \n
Ye things of greening gladness, leap and glow! \n
A black scar in the sunshine by the palm-leaf or the pine, \n
Blind to the night and dead to all desire; \n
Yet oh, of life and uplift what a symbol and a sign! \n
Yet oh, of power and conquest what a destiny is mine! \n
A little heap of ashes -- Yea! a miracle divine, \n
The foot-print of a god, all-radiant Fire. \n<|endoftext|>

Beauty is not always lovely; the fire was beautiful, the terror \n
Of the deer was beautiful; and when I returned \n
Down the back slopes after the fire had gone by, an eagle \n
Was perched on the jag of a burnt pine, \n
Insolent and gorged, cloaked in the folded storms of his shoulders \n
He had come from far off for the good hunting \n
With fire for his beater to drive the game; the sky was merciless \n
Blue, and the hills merciless black, \n
The sombre-feathered great bird sleepily merciless between them. \n
I thought, painfully, but the whole mind, \n
The destruction that brings an eagle from heaven is better than mercy. \n<|endoftext|>

fire \n
'Twas in the year of 1898, and on the 8th of June, \n
A mother and six children met with a cruel doom \n
In one of the most fearful fires for some years past \n
And as the spectators gazed upon them they stood aghast \n
The fire broke out in a hairdresser's, in the town of Scarborough, \n
And as the fire spread it filled the people's hearts with sorrow; \n
But the police and the fire brigade were soon on the ground, \n
Then the hose and reel were quickly sent round. \n
Oh! it was horrible to see the flames leaping up all around, \n
While amongst the spectators the silence was profound, \n
As they saw a men climb out to the parapet high, \n
Resolved to save his life, or in the attempt to die! \n
And he gave one half frantic leap, with his heart full of woe, \n
And came down upon the roof of a public-house 20 feet below; \n
But, alas! he slipped and fell through the skylight, \n
And received cuts and bruises: oh, what a horrible sight! \n
He was the tenant of the premises, Mr Brookes, \n
And for his wife and family he enquires, with anxious looks, \n
But no one could tell him, it did appear, \n
And when told so adown his cheeks flowed many a tear. \n
He had been sleeping by himself on the second floor, \n
When suddenly alarmed, he thought he'd make sure, \n
And try to escape from the burning pile with his life, \n
And try and save his family and his wife. \n
The fire brigade played on the first door with greet speed, \n
But the flames had very inflammable fuel upon which to feed, \n
So that the fire spread with awful rapidity, \n
And in twenty minutes the building was doomed to the fourth storey. \n
The firemen wrought with might and main, \n
But still the fire did on them gain, \n
That it was two hours before they could reach the second floor, \n
The heat being so intense they could scarcely it endure. \n
And inside all the time a woman and six children were there, \n
And when the firemen saw them, in amazement they did stare; \n
The sight that met their eyes made them for to start \n
Oh, Heaven! the sight was sufficient to rend the strongest heart. \n
For there was Mrs Brookes stretched dead on the floor, \n
Who had fallen in trying her escape for to procure. \n
She was lying with one arm over her ten months old child, \n
And her cries for help, no doubt, were frantic and wild; \n
And part of her arm was burned off as it lay above \n
The child she was trying to shield, which shows a mother's love. \n
For the baby's flesh was partly uninjured by the flames, \n
Which shows that the loving mother had endured great pains; \n
It, however, met its death by suffocation, \n
And as the spectators gazed thereon, it filled their hearts with consternation. \n
The firemen acted heroicallv, without any dread, \n
And when they entered the back premises they found the six children dead; \n
But Mr Brookes, 'tis said, is still alive, \n
And I hope for many years he will survive. \n
Oh, Heaven! it is cruel to perish by fire, \n
Therefore let us be watchful before to our beds we retire, \n
And see that everything is in safe order before we fall asleep, \n
And pray that God o'er us in the night watch will keep. \n<|endoftext|>

What gory deaths by fire, we see today! \n
Gone is ‘sati’ but brides burn still by stove; \n
In accidents too, people die this way; \n
Self-immolate, some people out of love! \n
Air-crash victims get burnt like wood and hay; \n
Bomb-blasts produces smell of burning flesh; \n
Bus burns with men in pugilistic way! \n
And nuclear accidents too happen fresh. \n
A cracker-unit burns its children down; \n
A Temple-fire engulfs so many souls; \n
Some men are dowsed, lit live in a big town; \n
Fire-extinguishers have but scarcer roles. \n

Probably I am an ordinary middle-class \n
believer in individual rights, the word \n
"freedom" is simple to me, it doesn't mean \n
the freedom of any class in particular. \n
Politically naive, with an average \n
education (brief moments of clear vision \n
are its main nourishment), I remember \n
the blazing appeal of that fire which parches \n
the lips of the thirsty crowd and burns \n
books and chars the skin of cities. I used to sing \n
those songs and I know how great it is \n
to run with others; later, by myself, \n
with the taste of ashes in my mouth, I heard \n
the lie's ironic voice and the choir screaming \n
and when I touched my head I could feel \n
the arched skull of my country, its hard edge. \n

He was an innocent criminal and a scapegoat \n

The true criminal with the Lords \n

One night in the prison cell \n
he saw a fire-fly like an ambulance \n
and he scribbled on the wall. \n
'Tomorrow morning a prince comes \n
to take me away, a better world, \n
my little fire-fly you try to show me the way \n

A bar drops from its place; a rafter falls \n
Burning the flowers. The wind in frenzy moans. \n
The watchers gaze, held wondering by the fire, \n
The dwellers cry their sorrow to the crowd, \n

To lose their glory in the frowning cloud, \n
Yielding at length the last reluctant breath. \n
And where life lay asleep broods darkly death. \n<|endoftext|>

If Success was Happiness \n
Then achievers would be glad \n
But look around and you will find \n
That many of them are sad \n
Of course, Achievement gives joy \n
And excitement, oh boy! \n
But when our need becomes our greed \n
To misery, this will lead \n
The whole world is chasing Success \n
Everyone wants achievement \n
Sometimes we win, sometimes we lose \n
There is no Contentment \n
Why do people want to succeed? \n
Why is everyone in a race? \n
The Truth is that we want to win \n
So that there is a smile on our face \n
But though we win, we are not glad \n
We have money, why are we sad? \n
Happiness is not money, the sages said \n
It's sleeping soundly when you are in bed \n
We hear of suicides in the homes of the rich \n
If they were Happy, then why this glitch? \n
Although they are achievers, this fact we know \n
They are not Happy, their face has no glow \n
If successful, but unhappy, what is the use? \n
Winning or smiling, what would you choose? \n
The purpose of Success is for us to be glad \n
What is the use of winning, if it makes us sad? \n
Happiness is something different, we learn \n
Not just money that we earn and burn \n
Happiness is built on a foundation of peace \n
Then we are blissful like waves in the seas \n
Look around at the people who are glad \n
They live in the moment, they are never sad \n
They don't swing from the future to the past \n
They are the ones whose Happiness lasts \n
Happiness has no price tag, know this my friend \n
It's a state of mind where nothing can offend \n
It's being able to smile, and able to laugh \n
Not just trying to raise our Success graph \n
We can't measure joy in dollar and pound \n
Happy is he who peace has found \n
Though we may fly the world around \n
We may be miserable on the ground \n
Success is not Happiness, this Truth we must know \n
We may have everything, what's the use of this show? \n
The truly successful one is he \n
Who lives with smile, laughter, and glee \n
If one is Happy, then one has achieved all \n
One doesn't have to be rich and in fame be tall \n
One can have little, but if content is he \n
Then he can live joyously \n
Achievement gives Happiness, this fact we know \n
But with Fulfilment and Contentment, does Happiness grow \n
One who is Happy, doesn't need to win \n
He has Peace and Joy without committing sin \n
Joy doesn't need a foundation of cash \n
One doesn't have to be rich, to enjoy life's bash \n
Happiness is a simple state of the mind \n
It comes from being loving, it comes from being Kind \n
Happiness is Success. It is achieving life's goal \n
It is being Happy in the heart, Peaceful in the Soul \n
True Happiness is eternal, not just a moment of joy \n
It last's forever, it can't be destroyed \n
Success is a journey of valleys and peaks \n
Life is a see-saw, there arelaughs and squeaks \n
Success, unlike Happiness, doesn't last for long \n
But the truly Happy ones always sing a Happy song \n
So, Success is not Happiness, Happiness is Success \n
You may be an achiever, whose heart is not at rest \n
But though not successful, if Happy you are \n
Then you are an achiever, you are the very best \n<|endoftext|>

a flame of response, \n
a desire of destination, \n
a bridge of dreams, \n
a plazer of demonstration, \n
a heart of modulation, \n
a birth of justification, \n
All just from a creation, \n
working for his nation, \n
his family and his passion, \n
overcoming every extinction, \n
with a big regret to distruction, \n
a new lump of dreams, \n
a new cry for success, \n
a new mind for aproval, \n
a new sun rise for hapy lif, \n
with a new passion for animation, \n
All jst for life he deserves, \n

with happines, and fires, \n
with love and respect, \n
and a few beautiful regret, \n

success \n
Success is counted sweetest \n
By those who ne'er succeed. \n
To comprehend a nectar \n
Requires sorest need. \n
Not one of all the purple Host \n
Who took the Flag today \n
Can tell the definition \n
So clear of Victory \n
As he defeated--dying-- \n
On whose forbidden ear \n
The distant strains of triumph \n
Burst agonized and clear! \n<|endoftext|>

O holy success, my darling success, \n
Weather indigo or starry, it'll glow, \n
As fountain vessel of blood \n
In my sweet faithful heart. \n
It shall sprung, from East South or \n
North West I don't have the idea \n
From Core Cardinal or spinning of axis \n
But my willing success i foresaw, \n
As inevitable as Death, my success' veritable, \n
Irreplaceable, irresistible, unstopably unchangeable, \n
O my destiny, I an a glorious child \n
No matter how far the Sky, I'll win \n
No matter how scary king Pharaoh, I'll rule, \n

Thou Suns smile, the star applause to the moon \n

success \n
Does success blind the man completely? \n
Not wait and go for its show immediately? \n
If he is earthly man then will slowly digest, \n
Means and ways set first and then suggest, \n
Only clever and seasoned will be enjoying, \n
All of sudden success may lead to annoying, \n
Way of living may bring tremendous change, \n
Confidence enhanced and disorderly manage, \n
Somebody may diversify to honouable living, \n
Purchase of luxurious cars and self driving, , \n
Honest may prefer and turn to charity reviving, \n
Rest may go for sight seeing and sea diving, \n
It brings dramatic change in way of thinking, \n
Sudden urge and change some time lead to sinking, \n
Arrogance and power blind a person, \n
As sudden change you may find with season, \n
You look towards fellow brothers as inferior creature, \n
Their hello and address bite you as vulture, \n
You feel their company danger for future, \n
Ill feeling and distrust in mind nurture, \n
This all takes away from main stream, \n
Success story makes you to believe as dream, \n
You feel as if you had God given chance, \n
Forget the past and visit the club for dance, \n
Drink, drug and smacks are natural ally, \n
Money in hand doesn’t look silly, \n
Pushed to the dark as time go on, \n
No way to come back, not even soon, \n
It will be nightmare or bad dream, \n
Success may blind but not allow to scream, \n
You will be completely cut off from friends, \n
Down to earth when success story ends \n
Success has another story to tell, \n
People have learnt how to remain well, \n
Act as humble and good ideas sell, \n
Where does then bad or descend the hell \n<|endoftext|>
success \n
What is the journey to success? \n
Success is not gained by defeat \n
Success does not occur over night \n
Success can emerge at any age \n
Success is working to full potential \n
Success is courage \n
Success is lending a hand \n
Success is not listening to negativity \n
Success is being positive \n
Success is living your life instead of the life of others \n
Success is being proud \n
Success is overcoming obstacles \n
Success is striving \n
Success is listening to your heart \n
Most of all success is accepting \n
What you have accomplished \n<|endoftext|>

Bitterness in life \n
Cannot be avoided \n
Without emotional involvement. \n
Though, we try \n
To make aur decesions \n
Without the fear \n
Of failure. \n
But to earn \n
The real success in life \n
And get stronger and stronger \n
With the passage of time, \n
We have to be dependent on the \n
Will of God \n
For God has set \n
A path for us \n
To follow and excel. \n<|endoftext|>

Success is fraught with failures, \n

Success is not the triumph over regress, \n
Success is the power to suppress. \n
Success is not the money or the fame, \n
Success is, knowing you are still the same. \n
Success is not the power or the pride. \n
Success is the knowing how to hide. \n
Success is not a gift or gain, \n
Success is accepting and believing in your name. \n
Success is not a point or goal to seek, \n
Success is, believing you have never reached the peak. \n
Success is \n<|endoftext|>

Just like how ocean’s waves all fall and rise, \n
Again, again incessantly, forev’r! \n
When failures come, remain we must most wise, \n
And try again, again but quit never. \n
The greatest men had failures too, much more; \n
Yet undeterred, they fought their way through them; \n
Recurrent failures could open new door; \n
Perseverance must be success emblem. \n
Learn from each failure but never look back; \n
Let world comment and mock, ’tis not for long; \n
But never do become lethargic/ slack; \n
No one predicts when rings your success gong! \n
Great men were dull once but never gave up; \n

Relieved from sinful \n

Hard work, honesty and humility, \n
intellect, intuition, indefatigable passion and \n

Kindness in thought, word and deed and \n
laziness always kept at bay. \n
Making the most of your time, \n
never thinking of ever giving up \n
or being afraid of taking a risk, \n
putting your heart, mind and soul into everything, \n
questioning yourself all the time and \n
rectifying mistakes made along the way. \n
Self-confidence and a strong desire \n
to make it to the finish line… \n
using whatever resources available and \n
vocalizing only positive thoughts. \n
When things don’t seem to go your way, \n
(e) xtraordinary patience and perseverance will pay. \n

success \n
When young I often thought success, \n
Meant wealth and power I must stress, \n
An easy life, with all lifes pleasures, \n
A mansion high, with worldly treasures, \n
Tours abroad to places new, \n
While in some bank my money grew, \n
Some people yes, tis aim they try, \n
Yet still a dream for you and I . \n
Late in life I thought again, \n
Together still through joys and pain, \n
Yes, we are wed through all those years \n
Sharing troubled times and tears, \n
Our money spent on all our plans, \n
Yet still so happy, holding hands, \n
Our children grown, as we grew old, \n
Your love for me worth more than gold \n
This love we share, I now caress, \n
I feel the secret of success. \n<|endoftext|>
success \n
When great Augustus govern'd ancient Rome, \n
And sent his conquering bands to foreign wars, \n
Abroad when dreaded, and beloved at home, \n
He saw his fame increasing with his years, \n
Horace, great bard, (so fate ordain'd) arose, \n
And, bold as were his countryman in fight, \n
Snatch'd their fair actions from degrading prose, \n
And set their battles in eternal light: \n
High as their trumpets tune his lyre he strung, \n
And with his prince's arms he moralized his song. \n
When bright Eliza ruled Britannia's state, \n
Widely distributing her high commands, \n
And, boldly wise and fortunately great, \n
Freed the glad nations from tyrannic bands, \n
An equal genius was in Spenser found; \n
To the high theme he match'd his noble lays; \n
He travelled England o'er on fairy ground, \n
In mystic notes to sing his monarch's praise: \n
Reciting wondrous truths in pleasing dreams \n
He deck'd Eliza's head with Gloriana's beams. \n
But, greatest Anna! while thy arms pursue \n
Paths of renown, and climb ascents of fame, \n
Which nor Augustus nor Eliza knew, \n
What poet shall be found to sing thy name? \n
What numbers shall record, what tongue shall say \n
Thy wars on land, thy triumphs on the main? \n
O fairest model of imperial sway! \n
What equal pen shall write thy wondrous reign? \n
Who shall attempts and feats of arms rehearse, \n
Nor yet by story told, nor parallel'd by verse? \n
Me all too mean for such a task I weet; \n
Yet if the sovereign Lady designs to smile \n
I'll follow Horace with impetuous heat, \n
And clothe the verse in Spenser's native style: \n
By these examples rightly taught to sing, \n
And smit with pleasure of my country's praise, \n
Stretching the plumes of an uncommon wing, \n
High as Olympus I my flight will raise, \n
And latest times shall in my numbers read \n
Anna's immortal fame and Marlborough's hardy deed. \n
As the strong eagle in the silent wood, \n
Mindless of warlike rage and hostile care, \n
Plays round the rocky cliff or crystal flood, \n
Till by Jove's high behests call'd out to war, \n
And charged with thunder of his angry king, \n
His bosom with the vengeful message glows, \n
Upward the noble bird directs his wing, \n
And towering round his master's earth-born foes, \n
Swift he collects his fatal stock of ire, \n
Lifts his fierce talon high, and darts the forked fire. \n
Sedate and calm thus victor Marlborough sate, \n
Shaded with laurels, in his native land, \n
Till Anna calls him from his soft retreat, \n
And gives her second thunder to his hand: \n
Then leaving sweet repose and gentle ease, \n
With ardent speed he seeks the distant foe, \n
Marching o'er hills and vales, o'er rocks and seas, \n
He meditates and strikes the wondrous blow. \n
Our thought flies slower than our General's fame; \n
Grasps he the bolt? (we ask) when he has hurl'd the flame. \n
When fierce Bavar on Judoign's spacious plain \n
Did from afar the British chief behold, \n
Betwixt despair, and rage, and hope, and pain, \n
Something within his warring bosom roll'd: \n
He views that favourite of indulgent Fame, \n
Whom whilom he had met on Ister's shore; \n
Too well, alas! the man he knows the same \n
Whose prowess there repell'd the Boyan power, \n
And sent them trembling thro' the frighted lands, \n
Swift as the whirlwind drives Arabia's scatter'd sands. \n
His former losses he forgets to grieve; \n
Absolves his fate with a kinder ray \n
It now would shine, and only give him leave \n
To balance the account of Blenheim's day. \n
So the fell lion, in the lonely glade, \n
His side still smarting with the hunter's spear, \n
Though deeply wounded, no way yet dismay'd, \n
Roars terrible, and meditates new war, \n
In sullen fury traverses the plain \n
To find the venturous foe, and battle him again. \n
Misguided prince, no longer urge thy fate, \n
Nor tempt the hero to unequal war; \n
Famed in misfortune, and in ruin great, \n
Confess the force of Malbro's stronger star. \n
Those laurel groves (the merits of thy youth) \n
Which thou from Mahomet didst greatly gain, \n
While, bold assertor of resistless truth, \n
Thy sword did godlike Liberty maintain. \n
Must from thy brow their falling honours shed, \n
And their transplanted wreaths must deck a worthier head. \n
Yet cease the ways of Providence to blame, \n
And human faults with human grief confess; \n
'Tis thou art changed, while Heaven is still the same; \n
From thy ill counsels date thy ill success: \n
Impartial Justice holds her equal scales, \n
Till stronger virtue does the weight incline; \n
If over thee thy glorious foe prevails, \n
He now defends the cause that once was thine. \n
Righteous the war, the champion shall subdue, \n
For Jove's great handmaid, Power, must Jove's decrees pursue. \n
Hark! the dire trumpets sound their shrill alarms! \n
Auverqueque, branch'd from the renown'd Nassaus, \n
Hoary in war, and bent beneath his arms, \n
His glorious sword with dauntless courage draws. \n
When anxious Britain mourn'd her parting lord, \n
And all of William that was mortal died, \n
The faithful hero had received his sword \n
From his expiring master's much-loved side: \n
Oft from its fatal ire has Louis flown, \n
Where'er great William led or Maese and Sambre run. \n
But brandish'd high, in an ill-omen'd hour \n
To thee, proud Gaul, behold thy justest fear, \n
The master-sword, disposer of thy power: \n
'Tis that which Caesar gave the British peer. \n
He took the gift: Nor ever will I sheath \n
This steel (so Anna's high behests ordain) \n
The General said, unless by glorious death \n
Absolved, till conquest has confirm'd your reign. \n
Returns like these our mistress bids us make, \n
When from a foreign prince a gift her Britons take. \n
And now fierce Gallia rushes on her foes, \n
Her force augmented by the Boyan bands; \n
So Volga's stream, increased by mountain snows, \n
Rolls with new fury down through Russia's lands. \n
Like two great rocks against the raging tide \n
(If Virtue's force with Nature's we compare) \n
Unmoved the two united chiefs abide, \n
Sustain the impulse, and receive the war: \n
Round their firm sides in vain the tempest beats, \n
And still the foaming wave with lessen'd power retreats. \n
The rage dispersed, the glorious pair advance, \n
With mingled anger and collected might, \n
To turn the war, and tell aggressing France \n
How Britain's sons and Britain's friends can fight. \n
On conquest fix'd, and covetous of fame, \n
Behold them rushing through the Gallic host; \n
Through standing corn so runs the sudden flame, \n
Or eastern winds along Sicilia's coast. \n
They deal their terrors to the adverse nation: \n
Pale Death attends their arms, and ghastly Desolation. \n
But while with fiercest ire Bellona glows, \n
And Europe rather hopes than fears her fate, \n
While Britain presses her afflicted foes, \n
What horror damps the strong and quells the great? \n
Whence look the soldier's cheeks dismay'd and pale? \n
Erst ever dreadful, know they now to dread? \n
The hostile troops, I ween, almost prevail, \n
And the pursuers only not recede. \n
Alas! their lessen'd rage proclaims their grief! \n
For anxious, lo! they crowd around their falling chief. \n
I thank thee, Fate, exclaims the fierce Bavar; \n
Let Boya's trumpet graceful Io's sound; \n
I saw him fall, their thunderbolt of war; - \n
Ever to Vengeance sacred be the ground - \n
Vain wish! short joy! the hero mounts again \n
In greater glory, and with fuller light; \n
The evening star so falls into the main, \n
To rise at morn more prevalently bright. \n
He rises safe, but near, too near his side, \n
A good man's grievous loss, a faithful servant died. \n
Propitious Mars! the battle is regain'd'; \n
The foe with lessen'd wrath disputes the field: \n
The Briton fights, by favoring gods sustain'd; \n
Freedom must live, and lawless power must yield. \n
Vain now the tales which fabling poets tell, \n
That wavering Conquest still desires to rove! \n
In Marlbro's camp the goddess knows to dwell; \n
Long as the hero's life remains her love. \n
Again France flies, again the Duke pursues, \n
And on Ramilia's plains he Blenheim's fame renews. \n
Great thanks, O Captain, great in arms! receive \n
From thy triumphant country's public voice; \n
Thy country greater thanks can only give \n
To Anne, to her who made those arms her choice. \n
Recording Schellenberg's and Blenheim's toils, \n
We dreaded lest thou should'st those toils repeat: \n
We view'd the palace charged with Gallic spoils, \n
And in those spoils we thought thy praise complete. \n
For never Greek we deem'd, nor Roman knight, \n
In characters like these did e'er his acts indite. \n
Yet, mindless still of ease, thy virtue flies \n
A pitch to old and modern times unknown: \n
Those goodly deeds, which we so highly prize, \n
Imperfect seem, great Chief, to thee alone. \n
Those heights, where William's virtue might have staid, \n
And on the subject world look'd safely down, \n
By Marlbro's pass'd, the props and steps were made \n
Sublimer yet to raise his Queen's renown: \n
Still gaining more, still slighting what he gain'd, \n
Nought done the hero deem'd while ought undone remain'd. \n
When swift-wing'd Rumour told the mighty Gaul \n
How lessen'd from the field Bavar was fled, \n
He wept the swiftness of the champion's fall, \n
And thus the royal treaty-breaker said: \n
And lives he yet, the great, the lost Bavar, \n
Ruin to Gallia in the name of friend? \n
Tell me how far has Fortune been severe? \n
Has the foe's glory of our grief an end? \n
Remains there, of the fifty thousand lost, \n
To save our threaten'd realm, or guard our shatter'd coast? \n
To the close rock the frighted raven flies, \n
Soon as the rising eagle cuts the air \n
The shaggy wolf unseen and trembling lies, \n
When the hoarse roar proclaims the lion near: \n
Ill starr'd did we our forts and lines forsake, \n
To dare our British foes to open fight: \n
Our conquest we by stategem should make: \n
'Tis ours by craft and by surprise to gain: \n
'Tis theirs, to meet in arms, and battle in the plain. \n
The ancient father of this hostile brood, \n
Their boasted Brute, undaunted snatch'd his gods \n
From burning Troy, and Xanthus red with blood, \n
And fix'd on silver Thames his dire abodes: \n
And this be Trynovante, he said, the seat \n
By Heaven ordain'd, my sons, your lasting place: \n
Superior here to all the bolts of fate \n
Live, mindful of the author of your race, \n
Whom neither Greece, nor war, nor want, nor flame, \n
Nor great Pelides' arm, nor Juno's rage, could tame. \n
Their Tudors hence, and Stuart's offspring flow: \n
Hence Edward, dreadful with his sable shield, \n
Talbot to Gallia's power eternal foe, \n
And Seymour, famed in council or in field: \n
Hence Nevel, great to settle or dethrone, \n
And Drake, and Ca'ndish, terrors of the sea: \n
Hence Butler's sons, o'er land and ocean known, \n
Herbert's and Churchill's warring progeny: \n
Hence the long roll which Gallia should conceal: \n
For, oh! who, vanquish'd, loves the victor's fame to tell? \n
Envy'd Britannia, sturdy as the oak, \n
Which on her mountain top she proudly bears, \n
Eludes the axe, and sproutes against the stroke; \n
Strong from her wounds, and greater by her wars. \n
And as those teeth, which Cadmus sow'd in earth, \n
Produced new youth, and furnish'd fresh supplies; \n
So with young vigour, and succeeding birth, \n
Her losses more than recompensed arise; \n
And every age she with a race is crown'd, \n
For letters more polite, in battles more renown'd. \n
Obstinate power, whom nothing can repel; \n
Not the fierce Saxon, nor the cruel Dane, \n
Nor deep impression of the Norman steel, \n
Nor Europe's force amass'd by envious Spain. \n
Nor France on universal sway intent, \n
Oft breaking leagues, and oft renewing wars; \n
Nor (frequent bane of weaken'd government) \n
Their own intestine feuds and mutual jars; \n
Those feuds and jars, in which I trusted more, \n
Than in my troops, and fleets, and all the Gallic power. \n
To fruitful Rheims, or fair Lutetia's gate, \n
What tidings shall the messenger convey? \n
Shall the loud herald our success relate, \n
Or mitred priest appoint the solemn day? \n
Alas! my praises they no more must sing; \n
They to my statue now must bow no more; \n
Broken, repulsed is their immortal king: \n
Fall'n, fall'n for ever, is the Gallic power.- \n
The woman chief is master of the war: \n
Earth she has freed by arms, and vanquish'd Heaven by prayer. \n
While thus the ruin'd foe's despair commends \n
Thy council and thy deed, victorious queen, \n
What shall thy subjects say, and what thy friends; \n
How shall thy triumphs in our joy be seen? \n
Oh! deign to let the eldest of the nine \n
Recite Britannia great and Gallia free; \n
Oh! with her sister Sculpture let her join \n
To raise, great Anne, the monument to thee; \n
To thee, of all our good the sacred spring; \n
To thee, our dearest dread; to thee, our softer king. \n
Let Europe, saved, the column high erect, \n
Than Trojan's higher, or than Antonine's, \n
Where sembling art may carve the fair effect \n
And full achievement of thy great designs, \n
In a calm heaven and a serener air \n
Sublime the queen shall on the summit stand, \n
From danger far, as far removed from fear, \n
And pointing down to earth her dread command. \n
All winds, all storms, that threaten human wo \n
Shall sink beneath her feet, and spread their rage below. \n
There fleets shall strive, by winds and waters tost, \n
Till the young Austrian on Iberia's strand, \n
Great as AEneas on the Latian coast \n
Shall fix his foot: And this, be this the land, \n
Great Jove, where I for ever will remain, \n
(The empire's other hope shall say) and here \n
Vanquish'd, intomb'd I'll lie, or crown'd I'll reign - \n
O Virtue, to thy British Mother dear! \n
Like the famed Trojan suffer and abide: \n
For Anne is thine, I ween, as Venus was his guide. \n
There, in eternal characters engraved, \n
Vigo, and Gibraltar, and Barcelone, \n
Their force destroy'd, their privileges saved, \n
Shall Anna's terrors and her mercies own: \n
Spain, from the usurper Bourbon's arms retrieved, \n
Shall with new life and grateful joy appear, \n
Numbering the wonders which that youth achieved \n
Whom Anna clad in arms and sent to war, \n
Whom Anna sent to claim Iberia's throne, \n
And made him more than king in calling him her son. \n
There Isther, pleased by Blenheim's glorious field, \n
Rolling, shall bid his eastern waves declare \n
Germania saved by Britain's ample shield, \n
And bleeding Gaul afflicted by her spear; \n
Shall bid them mention Marlbro', on that shore \n
Leading his islanders renown'd in arms, \n
Through climes where never British chief before \n
Or pitch'd his camp, or sounded his alarms; \n
Shall bid them bless the queen, who made his streams \n
Glorious as those of Boyne, and safe as those of Thames. \n
Brabantia, clad with fields, and crown'd with towers, \n
With decent joy shall her deliverer meet, \n
Shall own thy arms, great queen, and bless thy powers, \n
Laying the keys beneath thy subject's feet. \n
Flandria, by plenty made the home of war, \n
Shall weep her crime, and bow to Charles restored, \n
With double vows shall bless thy happy care \n
In having drawn and having sheathed the sword, \n
From these their sister provinces shall know \n
How Anne supports a friend, and how forgives a foe. \n
Bright swords, and crested helms, and pointed spears, \n
In artful piles around the work shall lie; \n
And shields indented deep in ancient wars, \n
Blazon'd with signs of Gallic heraldry; \n
And standards with distinguish'd honours bright, \n
Marks of high power and national command, \n
Which Valois' sons, and Bourbon's bore in fight, \n
Or gave to Foix', or Montmorancy's hand; \n
Great spoils, which Gallia must to Britain yield, \n
From Cressy's battle saved to grace Ramilia's field. \n
And, as fine art the spaces may dispose, \n
The knowing thought and curious eye shall see \n
Thy emblem, gracious queen, the British rose, \n
Type of sweet rule and gentle majesty: \n
The northern thistle, whom no hostile hand \n
Unhurt too rudely may provoke, I ween; \n
Hibernia's harp, device of her command, \n
And parent of her mirth shall there be seen: \n
Thy vanquish'd lilies, France, decay'd and torn, \n
Shall with disorder'd pomp the lasting work adorn. \n
Beneath, great queen, oh! very far beneath, \n
Next to the ground and on the humble base, \n
To save herself from darkness and from death, \n
That muse desires the last, the lowest place; \n
Who, though unmeet, yet touch'd the trembling string, \n
For the fair fame of Anne and Albion's land, \n
Who durst of war and martial fury sing; \n
And when thy will, and when thy subject's hand, \n
Had quell'd those wars, and bid that fury cease, \n
Hangs up her grateful harp to conquest, and to peace. \n<|endoftext|>

Paris Autumn \n
Leaving home in bitter cold \n
I waited for you at a small café \n
Red wine overflew my glass. \n
Rainy night Autumn \n
Familiar old streets and sidewalks \n
Leaves dropped on the park \n
Patiently, I waited for you, minutes then hours. \n
Silent Autumn \n
Beside Luxembourg garden \n
I waited for you on familiar stone bench. \n
Without you, my heart was frozen. \n
Where are you in Autumn? \n
My friend of brown eyes \n
And of fine blond hair \n
My fruit of sadness has red-ripened by awaiting. \n
Paris Autumn \n
Overflowing eyelids \n
My dorm girlfriend \n
Sneaked in with soft steps and whispers. \n
Voiceless Autumn \n
Fading lipstick on the lips \n
You returned with sadness \n
Forgetting bitterness, we amended our lives. \n
Autumn! Autumn! \n
Shady sky with low hanging clouds \n
With my generous loving heart \n
I have waited for you with my imprisoned heart and mind. \n
Autumn! ... Oh God! Autumn love! \n

Where the glistening glow of your love spells out Paris, \n
like the lights that shine upon it's midnight sky. \n
Fear not that place but take me there with you- tonight, \n
so we can spend all of eternity holding hands. \n
Side by side. \n
Let's live this moment: \n
right now, right here. \n
Under the moonlit roses as the flakes of them rain on us. \n
Paris is the city that mends all love sores, \n
so let's make all things wrong between us turn to right. \n<|endoftext|>

BEAUTIFUL Paris! morning star of nations! \n
The Lucifer of cities, lifting high \n
The beacon blaze of young democracy! \n
Medina and Gomorrha both in one \n
Medina of a high and holy creed \n
To be developed in a coming time! \n
Gomorrha, rampant with all vice and guilt \n
Luxurious, godless, grovelling, soaring Paris, \n
Laden with intellect, and yet not wise \n
Metropolis of satire and lampoon, \n
Of wit, of elegance, of mirth, of song, \n
And fearful tragedies done day by day, \n
Which put our hair on end in the open streets \n
The busy hive of awful memories, \n
The potent arbiter of popular will, \n
The great electric centre whence the shocks \n
Of pulsing freedom vibrate through tbe world- \n
Beautiful Paris! sacred to our hearts, \n
With all thy folly, all thy wickedness- \n
If but for Bailly, Vergniaud, Gensonne, \n
And noblest Roland, she of Roman soul, \n
And the great patriots and friends of man \n
Who went to death for holy liberty- \n
Lift up thy voice, O Paris! once again, \n
And speak the thought that labours in thy breast; \n
Shake off thy gauds and tinsels-be thyself; \n
Cease thy lewd jests, and heartless revelries, \n
Thy adoration of all worthless things, \n
Thy scorn, thy sarcasm, and thy unbelief; \n
And in the conflict and the march of men \n
Do justice to thy nature, and complete \n
The glorious work, so gloriously begun \n
By the great souls of pregnant eighty-nine. \n
Come forth, oh, Paris! freed from vice and stain, \n
Like a young warrior dallying too long \n
With loving women, wasting precious hours \n
In base delights and enervating sloth; \n
Who, when he shakes them off, puts back his hair \n
From his broad brow, and places on his head \n
The plumed helmet-throws his velvets off. \n
And swathes his vigorous limbs in glancing steel. \n
To lead true hearts to struggle for mankind. \n
Or if no more, Soldier of Liberty! \n
Thou 'lt lead the nations-stand upon the hill, \n
And, like a prophet, preach a holy creed \n
Of freedom, progress, peace, and happiness; \n
And all the world shall listen to thy voice, \n
And Tyranny, hyaena big with young, \n
Dreading the sound, shall farrow in affright. \n
And drop, still-born, her sanguinary cubs, \n
And many a bloody feud be spared mankind. \n
Poland again, with desperate grasp, shall seize \n
The neck of her enslaver, and extort \n
Full justice from his terror; Hungary, \n
Ermined and crown'd, shall sit in her own seat \n
In peaceful state and sober majesty; \n
And Italy, unloosening her bonds \n
By her strong will, shall be at last the home \n
Of broadly based and virtuous liberty, \n
And in her bosom nuture evermore, \n
Not the fierce virtues of her Roman youth, \n
But the calm blessings of her later time \n
Science, and art, and civilizing trade, \n
Divine philosophy, diviner song, \n
And true religion reconciled with man. \n
Speak out, O Paris! purify thyself \n
By noble thoughts, and deeds will follow them. \n
The world has need of thee. Humanity \n
Droops for thy dalliance with degraded things, \n
Alien, and most unworthy of the soul \n
That sleeps within thee. Rouse thyself, O Paris! \n
The time expects thee. Pyrenees, and Alps, \n
And Appenines, and snow-clad Balkans, wait, \n
With all their echoes, to repeat the words \n
Which thou must utter! Thou hast slumber'd long \n
Long dallied. Speak! The world will answer thee! \n<|endoftext|>
paris \n
She sits and reads her livre de poche \n
And drinks her glass vin rouge, \n
And in her eyes are fragile tears \n
That secretly perfuse; \n
She is a lonely frightened bird \n
Who stares intent, head bent on words \n
Sitting at her cafe table \n
Afraid of life, a hopeless fable. \n
Claude summoned with a crooking finger, \n
She lonely, rescued, tried to linger; \n
She lived with him La Vie Boheme \n
Sat at his feet and worshipped him. \n
He tired of his petite jeune fille \n
Who knelt so grateful at his knee; \n
With palette knife she slashed her wrists; \n
Broke in upon his latest tyrst. \n
Claude bound her veins and carried her \n
To a summoned ambulance; \n
La Folle Americaine restrained, \n
And vite, expelled from France. \n
She sits alone \n
In the Day Room sun \n
Beside the plexiglass; \n
A book of Sartre in her lap, \n
A cracker, her repast; \n
Claude did not come \n
To visit her \n
While on his State-side trip: \n
She ate \n
Crushed grapes from \n
Spearing thumb \n
And kissed his finger tips. \n<|endoftext|>

Is a magical place, \n
Like the beauty I see, \n
When I look at her face, \n
Pariss in springtime, \n

I will love her forever, \n
And Eternity. \n

1 \n
Far in the depth of Ida's inmost grove, \n
A scene for love and solitude design'd; \n
Where flowery woodbines wild, by Nature wove, \n
Form'd the lone bower, the royal swain reclined. \n
2 \n
All up the craggy cliffs, that tower'd to heaven, \n
Green waved the murmuring pines on every side; \n
Save where, fair opening to the beam of even, \n
A dale sloped gradual to the valley wide. \n
3 \n
Echo'd the vale with many a cheerful note; \n
The lowing of the herds resounding long, \n
The shrilling pipe, and mellow horn remote, \n
And social clamours of the festive throng. \n
4 \n
For now, low hovering o'er the western main, \n
Where amber clouds begirt his dazzling throne, \n
The Sun with ruddier verdure deck'd the plain; \n
And lakes and streams and spires triumphal shone. \n
5 \n
And many a band of ardent youths were seen; \n
Some into rapture fired by glory's charms, \n
Or hurl'd the thundering car along the green, \n
Or march'd embattled on in glittering arms. \n
6 \n
Others more mild, in happy leisure gay, \n
The darkening forest's lonely gloom explore, \n
Or by Scamander's flowery margin stray, \n
Or the blue Hellespont's resounding shore. \n
7 \n
But chief the eye to Ilion's glories turn'd, \n
That gleam'd along the extended champaign far, \n
And bulwarks in terrific pomp adorn'd, \n
Where Peace sat smiling at the frowns of War. \n
8 \n
Rich in the spoils of many a subject clime, \n
In pride luxurious blazed the imperial dome; \n
Tower'd 'mid the encircling grove the fane sublime, \n
And dread memorials mark'd the hero's tomb \n
9 \n
Who from the black and bloody cavern led \n
The savage stern, and soothed his boisterous breast; \n
Who spoke, and Science rear'd her radiant head, \n
And brighten'd o'er the long benighted waste: \n
10 \n
Or, greatly daring in his country's cause, \n
Whose heaven-taught soul the awful plan design'd, \n
Whence Power stood trembling at the voice of laws; \n
Whence soar'd on Freedom's wing the ethereal mind. \n
11 \n
But not the pomp that royalty displays, \n
Nor all the imperial pride of lofty Troy, \n
Nor Virtue's triumph of immortal praise \n
Could rouse the langour of the lingering boy. \n
12 \n
Abandon'd all to soft Enone's charms, \n
He to oblivion doom'd the listless day; \n
Inglorious lull'd in Love's dissolving arms, \n
While flutes lascivious breathed the enfeebling lay. \n
13 \n
To trim the ringlets of his scented hair: \n
To aim, insidious, Love's bewitching glance; \n
Or cull fresh garlands for the gaudy fair, \n
Or wanton loose in the voluptuous dance: \n
14 \n
These were his arts; these won Enone's love, \n
Nor sought his fetter'd soul a nobler aim. \n
Ah, why should beauty's smile those arts approve \n
Which taint with infamy the lover's flame? \n
15 \n
Now laid at large beside a murmuring spring, \n
Melting he listen'd to the vernal song, \n
And Echo, listening, waved her airy wing, \n
While the deep winding dales the lays prolong; \n
16 \n
When, slowly floating down the azure skies, \n
A crimson cloud flash'd on his startled sight, \n
Whose skirts gay-sparkling with unnumber'd dyes \n
Launch'd the long billowy trails of flickery light. \n
17 \n
That instant, hush'd was all the vocal grove, \n
Hush'd was the gale, and every ruder sound; \n
And strains aërial, warbling far above, \n
Rung in the ear a magic peal profound. \n
18 \n
Near and more near the swimming radiance roll'd; \n
Along the mountains stream the lingering fires; \n
Sublime the groves of Ida blaze with gold, \n
And all the Heaven resounds with louder lyres. \n
19 \n
The trumpet breathed a note: and all in air, \n
The glories vanish'd from the dazzled eye; \n
And three ethereal forms, divinely fair, \n
Down the steep glade were seen advancing nigh. \n
20 \n
The flowering glade fell level where they moved; \n
O'erarching high the clustering roses hung; \n
And gales from heaven on balmy pinion roved, \n
And hill and dale with gratulation rung. \n
21 \n
The FIRST with slow and stately step drew near, \n
Fix'd was her lofty eye, erect her mien: \n
Sublime in grace, in majesty severe, \n
She look'd and moved a goddess and a queen. \n
22 \n
Her robe along the gale profusely stream'd, \n
Light lean'd the sceptre on her bending arm; \n
And round her brow a starry circlet gleam'd, \n
Heightening the pride of each commanding charm. \n
23 \n
Milder the NEXT came on with artless grace, \n
And on a javelin's quivering length reclined: \n
To exalt her mien she bade no splendour blaze, \n
Nor pomp of vesture fluctuate on the wind. \n
24 \n
Serene, though awful, on her brow the light \n
Of heavenly wisdom shone; nor roved her eyes. \n
Save to the shadowy cliffs majestic height, \n
Or the blue concave of the involving skies. \n
25 \n
Keen were her eyes to search the inmost soul: \n
Yet virtue triumph'd in their beams benign, \n
And impious Pride oft felt their dread control, \n
When in fierce lightning flash'd the wrath divine1. \n
26 \n
With awe and wonder gazed the adoring swain; \n
His kindling cheeks great Virtue's power confess'd; \n
But soon 'twas o'er; for Virtue prompts in vain, \n
When Pleasure's influence numbs the nerveless breast. \n
27 \n
And now advanced the QUEEN of melting JOY, \n
Smiling supreme in unresisted charms: \n
Ah, then, what transports fired the trembling boy! \n
How throbb'd his sickening frame with fierce alarms! \n
28 \n
Her eyes in liquid light luxurious swim, \n
And languish with unutterable love. \n
Heaven's warm bloom glows along each brightening limb, \n
Where fluttering bland the veil's thin mantlings rove. \n
29 \n
Quick, blushing as abash'd, she half withdrew: \n
One hand a bough of flowering myrtle waved. \n
One graceful spread, where, scarce conceal'd from view, \n
Soft through the parting robe her bosom heaved. \n
30 \n
'Offspring of Jove supreme! beloved of Heaven! \n
Attend.' Thus spoke the Empress of the Skies. \n
'For know, to thee, high-fated prince, 'tis given \n
Through the bright realms of Fame sublime to rise, \n
31 \n
Beyond man's boldest hope; if nor the wiles \n
Of Pallas triumph o'er the ennobling thought; \n
Nor Pleasure lure with artificial smiles \n
To quaff the poison of her luscious draught. \n
32 \n
When Juno's charms the prize of beauty claim, \n
Shall aught on earth, shall aught in heaven contend? \n
Whom Juno calls to high triumphant fame, \n
Shall he to meaner sway inglorious bend? \n
33 \n
Yet lingering comfortless in lonesome wild, \n
Where Echo sleeps 'mid cavern'd vales profound, \n
The pride of Troy, Dominion's darling child, \n
Pines while the slow hour stalks in sullen round. \n
34 \n
Hear thou, of Heaven unconscious! From the blaze \n
Of glory, stream'd from Jove's eternal throne, \n
Thy soul, O mortal, caught the inspiring rays \n
That to a god exalt Earth's raptured son. \n
35 \n
Hence the bold wish, on boundless pinion borne, \n
That fires, alarms, impels the maddening soul; \n
The hero's eye, hence, kindling into scorn, \n
Blasts the proud menace, and defies control. \n
36 \n
But, unimproved, Heaven's noblest boons are vain, \n
No sun with plenty crowns the uncultured vale: \n
Where green lakes languish on the silent plain, \n
Death rides the billows of the western gale. \n
37 \n
Deep in yon mountain's womb, where the dark cave \n
Howls to the torrent's everlasting roar, \n
Does the rich gem its flashy radiance wave? \n
Or flames with steady ray the imperial ore? \n
38 \n
Toil deck'd with glittering domes yon champaign wide, \n
And wakes yon grove-embosom'd lawns to joy, \n
And rends the rough ore from the mountain's side, \n
Spangling with starry pomp the thrones of Troy. \n
39 \n
Fly these soft scenes. Even now, with playful art, \n
Love wreathes the flowery ways with fatal snare; \n
And nurse the ethereal fire that warms thy heart, \n
That fire ethereal lives but by thy care. \n
40 \n
Lo! hovering near on dark and dampy wing, \n
Sloth with stern patience waits the hour assign'd, \n
From her chill plume the deadly dews to fling, \n
That quench Heaven's beam, and freeze the cheerless mind. \n
41 \n
Vain, then, the enlivening sound of Fame's alarms, \n
For Hope's exulting impulse prompts no more: \n
Vain even the joys that lure to Pleasure's arms, \n
The throb of transport is for ever o'er. \n
42 \n
O who shall then to Fancy's darkening eyes \n
Recall the Elysian dreams of joy and light? \n
Dim through the gloom the formless visions rise, \n
Snatch'd instantaneous down the gulf of night. \n
43 \n
Thou who, securely lull'd in youth's warm ray, \n
Mark'st not the desolations wrought by Time, \n
Be roused or perish. Ardent for its prey, \n
Speeds the fell hour that ravages thy prime. \n
44 \n
And, 'midst the horrors shrined of midnight storm, \n
The fiend Oblivion eyes thee from afar, \n
Black with intolerable frowns her form, \n
Beckoning the embattled whirlwinds into war. \n
45 \n
Fanes, bulwarks, mountains, worlds, their tempest whelms; \n
Yet glory braves unmoved the impetuous sweep. \n
Fly then, ere, hurl'd from life's delightful realms, \n
Thou sink to Oblivion's dark and boundless deep. \n
46 \n
Fly, then, where Glory points the path sublime, \n
See her crown dazzling with eternal light! \n
'Tis Juno prompts thy daring steps to climb, \n
And girds thy bounding heart with matchless might. \n
47 \n
Warm in the raptures of divine desire, \n
Burst the soft chain that curbs the aspiring mind; \n
And fly where Victory, borne on wings of fire, \n
Waves her red banner to the rattling wind. \n
48 \n
Ascend the car: indulge the pride of arms, \n
Where clarions roll their kindling strains on high, \n
Where the eye maddens to the dread alarms, \n
And the long shout tumultuous rends the sky. \n
49 \n
Plunged in the uproar of the thundering field, \n
I see thy lofty arm the tempest guide: \n
Fate scatters lightning from thy meteor-shield, \n
And Ruin spreads around the sanguine tide. \n
50 \n
Go, urge the terrors of thy headlong car \n
On prostrate Pride, and Grandeur's spoils o'erthrown, \n
While all amazed even heroes shrink afar, \n
And hosts embattled vanish at thy frown. \n
51 \n
When glory crowns thy godlike toils, and all \n
The triumph's lengthening pomp exalts thy soul, \n
When lowly at thy feet the mighty fall, \n
And tyrants tremble at thy stern control: \n
52 \n
When conquering millions hail thy sovereign might, \n
And tribes unknown dread acclamation join; \n
How wilt thou spurn the forms of low delight! \n
For all the ecstasies of heaven are thine: \n
53 \n
For thine the joys, that fear no length of days, \n
Whose wide effulgence scorns all mortal bound: \n
Fame's trump in thunder shall announce thy praise, \n
Nor bursting worlds her clarion's blast confound.' \n
54 \n
The Goddess ceased, not dubious of the prize: \n
Elate she mark'd his wild and rolling eye, \n
Mark'd his lip quiver, and his bosom rise, \n
And his warm cheek suffused with crimson dye. \n
55 \n
But Pallas now drew near. Sublime, serene, \n
In conscious dignity she view'd the swain: \n
Then, love and pity softening all her mien, \n
Thus breathed with accents mild the solemn strain: \n
56 \n
'Let those whose arts to fatal paths betray, \n
The soul with passion's gloom tempestuous blind, \n
And snatch from Reason's ken the auspicious ray \n
Truth darts from heaven to guide the exploring mind. \n
57 \n
'But Wisdom loves the calm and serious hour, \n
When heaven's pure emanation beams confess'd: \n
Rage, ecstasy, alike disclaim her power, \n
She woo's each gentler impulse of the breast. \n
58 \n
Sincere the unalter'd bliss her charms impart, \n
Sedate the enlivening ardours they inspire: \n
She bids no transient rapture thrill the heart, \n
She wakes no feverish gust of fierce desire. \n
59 \n
Unwise, who, tossing on the watery way, \n
All to the storm the unfetter'd sail devolve: \n
Man more unwise resigns the mental sway, \n
Borne headlong on by passion's keen resolve. \n
60 \n
While storms remote but murmur on thine ear, \n
Nor waves in ruinous uproar round thee roll, \n
Yet, yet a moment check thy prone career, \n
And curb the keen resolve that prompts thy soul. \n
61 \n
Explore thy heart, that, roused by Glory's name, \n
Pants all enraptured with the mighty charm— \n
And does Ambition quench each milder flame? \n
And is it conquest that alone can warm? \n
62 \n
To indulge fell Rapine's desolating lust, \n
To drench the balmy lawn in streaming gore, \n
To spurn the hero's cold and silent dust— \n
Are these thy joys? Nor throbs thy heart for more? \n
63 \n
Pleased canst thou listen to the patriot's groan, \n
And the wild wail of Innocence forlorn? \n
And hear the abandon'd maid's last frantic moan, \n
Her love for ever from her bosom torn? \n
64 \n
Nor wilt thou shrink, when Virtue's fainting breath \n
Pours the dread curse of vengeance on thy head? \n
Nor when the pale ghost bursts the cave of death, \n
To glare distraction on thy midnight bed? \n
65 \n
Was it for this, though born to regal power, \n
Kind Heaven to thee did nobler gifts consign, \n
Bade Fancy's influence gild thy natal hour, \n
And bade Philanthropy's applause be thine? \n
66 \n
Theirs be the dreadful glory to destroy, \n
And theirs the pride of pomp, and praise suborn'd, \n
Whose eye ne'er lighten'd at the smile of Joy, \n
Whose cheek the tear of Pity ne'er adorn'd: \n
67 \n
Whose soul, each finer sense instinctive quell'd, \n
The lyre's mellifluous ravishment defies: \n
Nor marks where Beauty roves the flowery field, \n
Or Grandeur's pinion sweeps the unbounded skies. \n
68 \n
Hail to sweet Fancy's unexpressive charm! \n
Hail to the pure delights of social love! \n
Hail, pleasures mild, that fire not while ye warm, \n
Nor rack the exulting frame, but gently move! \n
69 \n
But Fancy soothes no more, if stern remorse \n
With iron grasp the tortured bosom wring. \n
Ah then! even Fancy speeds the venom's course, \n
Even Fancy points with rage the maddening sting. \n
70 \n
Her wrath a thousand gnashing fiends attend, \n
And roll the snakes, and toss the brands of hell; \n
The beam of Beauty blasts: dark heavens impend \n
Tottering: and Music thrills with startling yell. \n
71 \n
What then avails, that with exhaustless store \n
Obsequious Luxury loads thy glittering shrine? \n
What then avails, that prostrate slaves adore, \n
And Fame proclaims thee matchless and divine? \n
72 \n
What though bland Flattery all her arts apply? \n
Will these avail to calm the infuriate brain? \n
Or will the roaring surge, when heaved on high, \n
Headlong hang, hush'd, to hear the piping swain? \n
73 \n
In health how fair, how ghastly in decay \n
Man's lofty form! how heavenly fair the mind \n
Sublimed by Virtue's sweet enlivening sway! \n
But ah! to guilt's outrageous rule resign'd. \n
74 \n
How hideous and forlorn! when ruthless Care \n
With cankering tooth corrodes the seeds of life, \n
And deaf with passion's storms when pines Despair, \n
And howling furies rouse the eternal strife. \n
75 \n
Oh, by thy hopes of joy that restless glow, \n
Pledges of Heaven! be taught by Wisdom's lore; \n
With anxious haste each doubtful path forego, \n
And life's wild ways with cautious fear explore. \n
76 \n
Straight be thy course: nor tempt the maze that leads \n
Where fell Remorse his shapeless strength conceals, \n
And oft Ambition's dizzy cliff he treads, \n
And slumbers oft in Pleasure's flowery vales. \n
77 \n
Nor linger unresolved: Heaven prompts the choice, \n
Save when Presumption shuts the ear of Pride: \n
With grateful awe attend to Nature's voice, \n
The voice of Nature Heaven ordain'd thy guide. \n
78 \n
Warn'd by her voice the arduous path pursue, \n
That leads to Virtue's fane a hardy band: \n
What though no gaudy scenes decoy their view, \n
Nor clouds of fragrance roll along the land? \n
79 \n
What though rude mountains heave the flinty way? \n
Yet there the soul drinks light and life divine, \n
And pure aërial gales of gladness play, \n
Brace every nerve, and every sense refine. \n
80 \n
Go, prince, be virtuous and be blest. The throne \n
Rears not its state to swell the couch of Lust: \n
Nor dignify Corruption's daring son, \n
To o'erwhelm his humbler brethren of the dust. \n
81 \n
But yield an ampler scene to Bounty's eye, \n
An ampler range to Mercy's ear expand: \n
And, 'midst admiring nations, set on high \n
Virtue's fair model, framed by Wisdom's hand. \n
82 \n
Go then: the moan of Woe demands thine aid: \n
Pride's licensed outrage claims thy slumbering ire: \n
Pale Genius roams the bleak neglected shade, \n
And battening Avarice mocks his tuneless lyre. \n
83 \n
Even Nature pines, by vilest chains oppress'd: \n
The astonish'd kingdoms crouch to Fashion's nod. \n
O ye pure inmates of the gentle breast, \n
Truth, Freedom, Love, O where is your abode? \n
84 \n
O yet once more shall Peace from heaven return, \n
And young Simplicity with mortals dwell! \n
Nor Innocence the august pavilion scorn, \n
Nor meek Contentment fly the humble cell! \n
85 \n
Wilt thou, my prince, the beauteous train implore \n
'Midst earth's forsaken scenes once more to bide? \n
Then shall the shepherd sing in every bower, \n
And Love with garlands wreathe the domes of Pride. \n
86 \n
The bright tear starting in the impassion'd eyes \n
Of silent Gratitude: the smiling gaze \n
Of Gratulation, faltering while he tries \n
With voice of transport to proclaim thy praise: \n
87 \n
The ethereal glow that stimulates thy frame, \n
When all the according powers harmonious move, \n
And wake to energy each social aim, \n
Attuned spontaneous to the will of Jove: \n
88 \n
Be these, O man, the triumphs of thy soul; \n
And all the conqueror's dazzling glories slight, \n
That meteor-like o'er trembling nations roll, \n
To sink at once in deep and dreadful night. \n
89 \n
Like thine, yon orb's stupendous glories burn \n
With genial beam; nor, at the approach of even, \n
In shades of horror leave the world to mourn, \n
But gild with lingering light the empurpled heaven.' \n
90 \n
Thus while she spoke, her eye, sedately meek, \n
Look'd the pure fervour of maternal love. \n
No rival zeal intemperate flush'd her cheek— \n
Can Beauty's boast the soul of Wisdom move? \n
91 \n
Worth's noble pride, can Envy's leer appal, \n
Or staring Folly's vain applauses soothe? \n
Can jealous Fear Truth's dauntless heart enthrall? \n
Suspicion lurks not in the heart of Truth. \n
92 \n
And now the shepherd raised his pensive head: \n
Yet unresolved and fearful roved his eyes, \n
Scared at the glances of the awful maid; \n
For young unpractised Guilt distrusts the guise \n
93 \n
Of shameless Arrogance.—His wavering breast, \n
Though warm'd by Wisdom, own'd no constant fire, \n
While lawless Fancy roam'd afar, unblest \n
Save in the oblivious lap of soft Desire. \n
94 \n
When thus the queen of soul-dissolving smiles: \n
'Let gentler fate my darling prince attend, \n
Joyless and cruel are the warrior's spoils, \n
Dreary the path stern Virtue's sons ascend. \n
95 \n
Of human joy full short is the career, \n
And the dread verge still gains upon your sight; \n
While idly gazing far beyond your sphere, \n
Ye scan the dream of unapproach'd delight: \n
96 \n
Till every sprightly hour and blooming scene \n
Of life's gay morn unheeded glides away, \n
And clouds of tempests mount the blue serene, \n
And storms and ruin close the troublous day. \n
97 \n
Then still exult to hail the present joy, \n
Thine be the boon that comes unearn'd by toil; \n
No forward vain desire thy bliss annoy, \n
No flattering hope thy longing hours beguile. \n
98 \n
Ah! why should man pursue the charms of Fame, \n
For ever luring, yet for ever coy? \n
Light as the gaudy rainbow's pillar'd gleam, \n
That melts illusive from the wondering boy! \n
99 \n
What though her throne irradiate many a clime, \n
If hung loose-tottering o'er the unfathom'd tomb? \n
What though her mighty clarion, rear'd sublime, \n
Display the imperial wreath and glittering plume? \n
100 \n
Can glittering plume, or can the imperial wreath \n
Redeem from unrelenting fate the brave? \n
What note of triumph can her clarion breathe, \n
To alarm the eternal midnight of the grave? \n
101 \n
That night draws on: nor will the vacant hour \n
Of expectation linger as it flies: \n
Nor fate one moment unenjoy'd restore: \n
Each moment's flight how precious to the wise! \n
102 \n
O shun the annoyance of the bustling throng, \n
That haunt with zealous turbulence the great: \n
There coward Office boasts the unpunish'd wrong, \n
And sneaks secure in insolence of state. \n
103 \n
O'er fancied injury Suspicion pines, \n
And in grim silence gnaws the festering wound: \n
Deceit the rage-embitter'd smile refines, \n
And Censure spreads the viperous hiss around. \n
104 \n
Hope not, fond prince, though Wisdom guard thy throne, \n
Though Truth and Bounty prompt each generous aim, \n
Though thine the palm of peace, the victor's crown, \n
The Muse's rapture, and the patriot's flame: \n
105 \n
Hope not, though all that captivates the wise, \n
All that endears the good exalt thy praise: \n
Hope not to taste repose: for Envy's eyes \n
At fairest worth still point their deadly rays. \n
106 \n
Envy, stern tyrant of the flinty heart, \n
Can aught of Virtue, Truth, or Beauty charm? \n
Can soft Compassion thrill with pleasing smart, \n
Repentance melt, or Gratitude disarm? \n
107 \n
Ah no. Where Winter Scythia's waste enchains, \n
And monstrous shapes roar to the ruthless storm, \n
Not Phoebus' smile can cheer the dreadful plains, \n
Or soil accursed with balmy life inform. \n
108 \n
Then, Envy, then is thy triumphant hour, \n
When mourns Benevolence his baffled scheme: \n
When Insult mocks the clemency of Power, \n
And loud dissension's livid firebrands gleam: \n
109 \n
When squint-eyed Slander plies the unhallow'd tongue, \n
From poison'd maw when Treason weaves his line, \n
And Muse apostate (infamy to song!) \n
Grovels, low muttering, at Sedition's shrine. \n
110 \n
Let not my prince forego the peaceful shade, \n
The whispering grove, the fountain and the plain: \n
Power, with the oppressive weight of pomp array'd, \n
Pants for simplicity and ease in vain. \n
111 \n
The yell of frantic Mirth may stun his ear, \n
But frantic Mirth soon leaves the heart forlorn; \n
And Pleasure flies that high tempestuous sphere: \n
Far different scenes her lucid paths adorn. \n
112 \n
She loves to wander on the untrodden lawn, \n
Or the green bosom of reclining hill, \n
Soothed by the careless warbler of the dawn, \n
Or the lone plaint of ever-murmuring rill. \n
113 \n
Or from the mountain glade's aërial brow, \n
While to her song a thousand echoes call, \n
Marks the wide woodland wave remote below, \n
Where shepherds pipe unseen, and waters fall. \n
114 \n
Her influence oft the festive hamlet proves, \n
Where the high carol cheers the exulting ring; \n
And oft she roams the maze of wildering groves, \n
Listening the unnumber'd melodies of Spring. \n
115 \n
Or to the long and lonely shore retires; \n
What time, loose-glimmering to the lunar beam, \n
Faint heaves the slumberous wave, and starry fires \n
Gild the blue deep with many a lengthening gleam. \n
116 \n
Then to the balmy bower of Rapture borne, \n
While strings self-warbling breathe Elysian rest, \n
Melts in delicious vision, till the morn \n
Spangle with twinkling dew the flowery waste. \n
117 \n
The frolic Moments, purple-pinion'd, dance \n
Around, and scatter roses as they play; \n
And the blithe Graces, hand in hand, advance, \n
Where, with her loved compeers, she deigns to stray; \n
118 \n
Mild Solitude, in veil of rustic dye, \n
Her sylvan spear with moss-grown ivy bound; \n
And Indolence, with sweetly languid eye, \n
And zoneless robe that trails along the ground; \n
119 \n
But chiefly Love—O thou, whose gentle mind \n
Each soft indulgence Nature framed to share; \n
Pomp, wealth, renown, dominion, all resign'd, \n
Oh, haste to Pleasure's bower, for Love is there. \n
120 \n
Love, the desire of Gods! the feast of heaven! \n
Yet to Earth's favour'd offspring not denied! \n
Ah! let not thankless man the blessing given \n
Enslave to Fame, or sacrifice to Pride. \n
121 \n
Nor I from Virtue's call decoy thine ear; \n
Friendly to Pleasure are her sacred laws: \n
Let Temperance' smile the cup of gladness cheer; \n
That cup is death, if he withhold applause. \n
122 \n
Far from thy haunt be Envy's baneful sway, \n
And Hate, that works the harass'd soul to storm; \n
But woo Content to breathe her soothing lay, \n
And charm from Fancy's view each angry form. \n
123 \n
No savage joy the harmonious hours profane! \n
Whom Love refines, can barbarous tumults please? \n
Shall rage of blood pollute the sylvan reign? \n
Shall Leisure wanton in the spoils of Peace? \n
124 \n
Free let the feathery race indulge the song, \n
Inhale the liberal beam, and melt in love: \n
Free let the fleet hind bound her hills along, \n
And in pure streams the watery nations rove. \n
125 \n
To joy in Nature's universal smile \n
Well suits, O man, thy pleasurable sphere; \n
But why should Virtue doom thy years to toil? \n
Ah! why should Virtue's laws be deem'd severe? \n
126 \n
What meed, Beneficence, thy care repays? \n
What, Sympathy, thy still returning pang? \n
And why his generous arm should Justice raise, \n
To dare the vengeance of a tyrant's fang? \n
127 \n
From thankless spite no bounty can secure; \n
Or froward wish of discontent fulfil, \n
That knows not to regret thy bounded power, \n
But blames with keen reproach thy partial will. \n
128 \n
To check the impetuous all-involving tide \n
Of human woes, how impotent thy strife! \n
High o'er thy mounds devouring surges ride, \n
Nor reck thy baffled toils, or lavish'd life. \n
129 \n
The bower of bliss, the smile of love be thine, \n
Unlabour'd ease, and leisure's careless dream. \n
Such be their joys who bend at Venus' shrine, \n
And own her charms beyond compare supreme.' \n
130 \n
Warm'd as she spoke, all panting with delight, \n
Her kindling beauties breathed triumphant bloom; \n
And Cupids flutter'd round in circlets bright, \n
And Flora pour'd from all her stores perfume. \n
131 \n
'Thine be the prize,' exclaim'd the enraptured youth, \n
'Queen of unrivall'd charms, and matchless joy.'— \n
O blind to fate, felicity, and truth! \n
But such are they whom Pleasure's snares decoy. \n
132 \n
The Sun was sunk; the vision was no more; \n
Night downward rush'd tempestuous, at the frown \n
Of Jove's awaken'd wrath: deep thunders roar, \n
And forests howl afar, and mountains groan, \n
133 \n
And sanguine meteors glare athwart the plain; \n
With horror's scream the Ilian towers resound, \n
Raves the hoarse storm along the bellowing main, \n
And the strong earthquake rends the shuddering ground. \n<|endoftext|>

I want to look into her dreamy eyes, But she turns them away and my heart sighs. I want to hold her hand and intertwine our fingures, But my \n

Cruise the Seine River, admire art at the Louvre and the Musée d'Orsay, and see the quintessential Parisian sights of the Arc de Triomphe and Notre Dame. Enjoy a good book and coffee at a café on the Champs-Elysées, have a picnic of fresh bread and cheese in the Tuileries Garden, or take in a dinner show at The Moulin Rouge. Cap off your trip with an evening ascent up the Eiffel Tower to witness the City of Lights in full glory. \n<|endoftext|>

So he, with a clear shout of laughter, \n
Forth of his ambush leapt, and he vaunted him, uttering thiswise: \n
'Hit thou art! not in vain flew the shaft; how by rights it had pierced thee \n
Into the undermost gut, therewith to have rived thee of life-breath! \n
Following that had the Trojans plucked a new breath from their direst, \n
They all frighted of thee, as the goats bleat in flight from a lion.' \n
Then unto him untroubled made answer stout Diomedes: \n
'Bow-puller, jiber, thy bow for thy glorying, spyer at virgins! \n
If that thou dared'st face me here out in the open with weapons, \n
Nothing then would avail thee thy bow and thy thick shot of arrows. \n
Now thou plumest thee vainly because of a graze of my footsole; \n
Reck I as were that stroke from a woman or some pettish infant. \n
Aye flies blunted the dart of the man that's emasculate, noughtworth! \n
Otherwise hits, forth flying from me, and but strikes it the slightest, \n
My keen shaft, and it numbers a man of the dead fallen straightway. \n
Torn, troth, then are the cheeks of the wife of that man fallen slaughtered, \n
Orphans his babes, full surely he reddens the earth with his blood-drops, \n
Rotting, round him the birds, more numerous they than the women.' \n<|endoftext|>

Who hath desired the Sea? -- the sight of salt water unbounded -- \n
The heave and the halt and the hurl and the crash of the comber wind-hounded? \n
The sleek-barrelled swell before storm, grey, foamless, enormous, and growing -- \n
Stark calm on the lap of the Line or the crazy-eyed hurricane blowing -- \n
His Sea in no showing the same his Sea and the same 'neath each showing: \n
His Sea as she slackens or thrills? \n
So and no otherwise -- so and no otherwise -- hillmen desire their Hills! \n
Who hath desired the Sea? -- the immense and contemptuous surges? \n
The shudder, the stumble, the swerve, as the star-stabbing bow-sprit emerges? \n
The orderly clouds of the Trades, the ridged, roaring sapphire thereunder -- \n
Unheralded cliff-haunting flaws and the headsail's low-volleying thunder -- \n
His Sea in no wonder the same his Sea and the same through each wonder: \n
His Sea as she rages or stills? \n
So and no otherwise -- so and no otherwise -- hillmen desire their Hills. \n
Who hath desired the Sea? Her menaces swift as her mercies? \n
The in-rolling walls of the fog and the silver-winged breeze that disperses? \n
The unstable mined berg going South and the calvings and groans that declare it -- \n
White water half-guessed overside and the moon breaking timely to bare it -- \n
His Sea as his fathers have dared -- his Sea as his children shall dare it: \n
His Sea as she serves him or kills? \n
So and no otherwise -- so and no otherwise -- hillmen desire their Hills. \n
Who hath desired the Sea? Her excellent loneliness rather \n
Than forecourts of kings, and her outermost pits than the streets where men gather \n
Inland, among dust, under trees -- inland where the slayer may slay him -- \n
Inland, out of reach of her arms, and the bosom whereon he must lay him \n
His Sea from the first that betrayed -- at the last that shall never betray him: \n
His Sea that his being fulfils? \n

gathers for a last onslaught, and yet they \n
hold, side by side, in the eye of memory. \n
What was she wearing, you ask, what did he \n
say to make the riding clouds hold their breath? \n
Our late August afternoons were chilly \n
in America, so I shall drape her throat \n
in a silken scarf above a black dress. \n
I could give her a rope of genuine pearls \n
as a gift for bearing my father's sons, \n
and let each pearl glow with a child's fire. \n
I could turn her toward you now with a smile \n
so that we might joy in her constancy, \n
I could bury the past in dust rising, \n
dense rain falling, and the absence of sky \n
so that you could turn this page and smile. \n
My father and mother, two tiny figures, \n
side by side, facing the clouds that move \n

sea \n
We walked beside the sea, \n
After a day which perished silently \n
Of its own glory---like the Princess weird \n
Who, combating the Genius, scorched and seared, \n
Uttered with burning breath, 'Ho! victory!' \n
And sank adown, an heap of ashes pale; \n
So runs the Arab tale. \n
The sky above us showed \n
An universal and unmoving cloud, \n
On which, the cliffs permitted us to see \n
Only the outline of their majesty, \n
As master-minds, when gazed at by the crowd! \n
And, shining with a gloom, the water grey \n
Swang in its moon-taught way. \n
Nor moon nor stars were out. \n
They did not dare to tread so soon about, \n
Though trembling, in the footsteps of the sun. \n
The light was neither night's nor day's, but one \n
Which, life-like, had a beauty in its doubt; \n
And Silence's impassioned breathings round \n
Seemed wandering into sound. \n
O solemn-beating heart \n
Of nature! I have knowledge that thou art \n
Bound unto man's by cords he cannot sever--- \n
And, what time they are slackened by him ever, \n
So to attest his own supernal part, \n
Still runneth thy vibration fast and strong, \n
The slackened cord along. \n
For though we never spoke \n
Of the grey water anal the shaded rock,--- \n
Dark wave and stone, unconsciously, were fused \n
Into the plaintive speaking that we used, \n
Of absent friends and memories unforsook; \n
And, had we seen each other's face, we had \n
Seen haply, each was sad. \n<|endoftext|>

sea \n
A pathetic tale of the sea I will unfold, \n
Enough to make one's blood run cold; \n
Concerning four fishermen cast adrift in a dory. \n
As I've been told I'll relate the story. \n
T'was on the 8th April on the afternoon of that day \n
That the village of Louisburg was thrown into a wild state or dismay, \n
And the villagers flew to the beach in a state of wild uproar \n
And in a dory they found four men were cast ashore. \n
Then the villagers, in surprise assembled about the dory, \n
And they found that the bottom of the boat was gory; \n
Then their hearts were seized with sudden dread, \n
when they discovered that two of the men were dead. \n
And the two survivors were exhausted from exposure, hunger, and cold, \n
Which used the spectators to shudder when them they did behold; \n
And with hunger the poor men couldn't stand on their feet, \n
They felt so weakly on their legs for want of meat. \n
They were carried to a boarding-house without delay, \n
But those that were looking on were stricken with dismay, \n
When the remains of James and Angus McDonald were found in the boat, \n
Likewise three pieces or flesh in a pool or blood afloat. \n
Angus McDonald's right arm was missing from the elbow, \n
and the throat was cut in a sickening manner which filled the villagers hearts with woe, \n
Especially when they saw two pieces of flesh had been cut from each thigh, \n
'Twas then the kind-hearted villagers did murmur and sigh. \n
Angus McDonald must have felt the pangs of hunger before he did try \n
to cut two pieces of fiesh from James McDonald's thigh, \n
But, Oh heaven! the pangs of hunger are very hard to thole, \n
And anything that's eatable is precious unto an hungry soul. \n
Alas it is most pitiful and horrible to think \n
That with hunger christians will each other's blood drink \n
And eat each other's flesh to save themselves from starvation; \n
But the pangs or hunger makes them mad, and drives them to desperation. \n
An old American soldier that had passed through the Civil War, \n
Declared the scene surpassed anything he's seen by far, \n
And at the sight, the crowd in horror turned away, \n
which no doubt they will remember for many a day. \n
Colin Chisholm, one of the survivors was looking very pale, \n
Stretched on a sofa at the boarding-house, making his wail: \n
Poor fellow! his feet was greatly swollen, and with a melancholy air, \n
He gave the following account of the distressing affair: \n
We belonged to the American fishing schooner named "Cicely", \n
And our captain was a brave man, called McKenzie; \n
And the vessel had fourteen hands altogether \n
And during the passage we had favourable weather. \n
'Twas on March the 17th we sailed from Gloucester on the Wednesday \n
And all our hearts felt buoyant and gay; \n
And we arrived on the Western banks on the succeeding Tuesday, \n
While the time unto us seemed to pass merrily away. \n
About eight O'clock in the morning, we left the vessel in a dory, \n
And I hope all kind christians will take heed to my story; \n
Well, while we were at our work, the sky began to frown, \n
And with a dense fog we were suddenly shut down \n
Then we hunted and shouted, and every nerve did strain, \n
Thinking to find our schooner but, alas! it was all in vain: \n
Because the thick fog hid the vessel from our view, \n
And to keep ourselves warm we closely to each other drew. \n
We had not one drop of water , nor provisions of any kind, \n
Which, alas soon began to tell on our mind; \n
Especially upon James McDonald who was very thinly clad, \n
And with the cold and hunger he felt almost mad. \n
And looking from the stern where he was lying, \n
he said Good bye, mates, Oh! I am dying! \n
Poor fellow we kept his body thinking the rest of us would be saved, \n
Then, with hunger, Angus McDonald began to cry and madly raved. \n
And he cried, Oh, God! send us some kind of meat, \n
Because I'm resolved to have something to eat; \n
Oh! do not let us starve on the briny flood \n
Or else I will drink of poor Jim's blood. \n
Then he suddenly seized his knife and cut off poor Jim's arm, \n
Not thinking in his madness he'd done any harm; \n
Then poor Jim's blood he did drink and his flesh did eat, \n
Declaring that the blood tasted like cream, and was a treat. \n
Then he asked me to taste it, saying It was good without doubt, \n
Then I tasted it, but in disgust I instantly spat it out; \n
Saying, if I was to die within an hour on the briny flood, \n
I would neither eat the flesh nor drink the blood. \n
Then in the afternoon again he turned to me, \n
Saying, I'm going to cut Jim's throat for more blood d'ye see; \n
Then I begged of him, for God's sake not to cut the throat of poor Jim, \n
But he cried, Ha! ha! to save my own life I consider it no sin. \n
I tried to prevent him but he struck me without dismay \n
And cut poor Jim's throat in defiance of me, or all I could say, \n
Also a piece of flesh from each thigh, and began to eat away, \n
But poor fellow he sickened about noon, and died on the Sunday. \n
Now it is all over and I will thank all my life, \n
Who has preserved me and my mate, McEachern, in the midst of danger and strife; \n
And I hope that all landsmen of low and high degree, \n
Will think of the hardships of poor mariners while at sea. \n<|endoftext|>

Out of the delicate dream of the distance an emerald emerges \n
Veiled in the violet folds of the air of the sea; \n
Softly the dream grows awakening -- shimmering white of a city, \n
Splashes of crimson, the gay bougainvillea, the palms. \n
High in the infinite blue of its heaven a quiet cloud lingers, \n
Lost and forgotten of winds that have fallen asleep, \n
Fallen asleep to the tune of a Portuguese song in a garden. \n<|endoftext|>

There dwells a wife by the Northern Gate, \n
And a wealthy wife is she; \n
She breeds a breed o' rovin' men \n
And casts them over sea. \n
And some are drowned in deep water, \n
And some in sight o' shore, \n
And word goes back to the weary wife \n
And ever she sends more. \n
For since that wife had gate or gear, \n
Or hearth or garth or bield, \n
She willed her sons to the white harvest, \n
And that is a bitter yield. \n
She wills her sons to the wet ploughing, \n
To ride the horse of tree, \n
And syne her sons come back again \n
Far-spent from out the sea. \n
The good wife's sons come home again \n
With little into their hands, \n
But the lore of men that ha' dealt with men \n
In the new and naked lands; \n
But the faith of men that ha' brothered men \n
By more than easy breath, \n
And the eyes o' men that ha' read wi' men \n
In the open books of death. \n
Rich are they, rich in wonders seen, \n
But poor in the goods o' men; \n
So what they ha' got by the skin o' their teeth \n
They sell for their teeth again. \n
For whether they lose to the naked life \n
Or win to their hearts' desire, \n
They tell it all to the weary wife \n
That nods beside the fire. \n
Her hearth is wide to every wind \n
That makes the white ash spin; \n
And tide and tide and 'tween the tides \n
Her sons go out and in; \n
(Out with great mirth that do desire \n
Hazard of trackless ways, \n
In with content to wait their watch \n
And warm before the blaze); \n
And some return by failing light, \n
And some in waking dream, \n
For she hears the heels of the dripping ghosts \n
That ride the rough roof-beam. \n
Home, they come home from all the ports, \n
The living and the dead; \n
The good wife's sons come home again \n
For her blessing on their head! \n<|endoftext|>

Lo, I have loved thee long, long have I yearned and entreated! \n
Tell me how I may win thee, tell me how I must woo. \n
Shall I creep to thy white feet, in guise of a humble lover ? \n
Shall I croon in mild petition, murmuring vows anew ? \n
Shall I stretch my arms unto thee, biding thy maiden coyness, \n
Under the silver of morning, under the purple of night ? \n
Taming my ancient rudeness, checking my heady clamor­ \n
Thus, is it thus I must woo thee, oh, my delight? \n
Nay, 'tis no way of the sea thus to be meekly suitor­ \n
I shall storm thee away with laughter wrapped in my beard of snow, \n
With the wildest of billows for chords I shall harp thee a song for thy bridal, \n
A mighty lyric of love that feared not nor would forego! \n
With a red-gold wedding ring, mined from the caves of sunset, \n
Fast shall I bind thy faith to my faith evermore, \n
And the stars will wait on our pleasure, the great north wind will trumpet \n
A thunderous marriage march for the nuptials of sea and shore. \n<|endoftext|>

From my window I can see, \n
Where the sandhills dip, \n
One far glimpse of open sea. \n
Just a slender slip \n
Curving like a crescent moon— \n
Yet a greater prize \n
Than the harbour garden-fair \n
Spread beneath my eyes. \n
Just below me swings the bay, \n
Sings a sunny tune, \n
But my heart is far away \n
Out beyond the dune; \n
Clearer far the sea-gulls’ cry \n
And the breakers’ roar, \n
Than the little waves beneath \n
Lapping on the shore. \n
For that strip of sapphire sea \n
Set against the sky \n
Far horizons means to me— \n
And the ships go by \n
Framed between the empty sky \n
And the yellow sands, \n
While my freed thoughts follow them \n
Out to other lands. \n
All its changes who can tell? \n
I have seen it shine \n
Like a jewel polished well, \n
Hard and clear and fine; \n
Then soft lilac—and again \n
On another day \n
Glimpsed it through a veil of rain, \n
Shifting, drifting grey. \n
When the livid waters flee, \n
Flinching from the storm, \n
From my window I can see, \n
Standing safe and warm, \n
How the white foam tosses high \n
On the naked shore, \n
And the breakers’ thunder grows \n
To a battle-roar… \n
Far and far I look—Ten miles? \n
No, for yesterday \n
Sure I saw the Blessed Isles \n
Twenty worlds away. \n
My blue moon of open sea, \n
Is it little worth? \n
At the least it gives to me \n
Keys of all the earth \n<|endoftext|>

Ill-fated Maid, ne'er shall thy gentle breast \n

Ne'er shall that timid form again be press'd \n
In the dear bondage of unsullied love: \n
Stern Heaven forbids­the dark o'erwhelming deep \n
Mocks the poor pilot's skill, and braves his sighs; \n
O'er the high deck the frothy billows sweep, \n
And the fierce tempest drowns the sea boy's cries. \n
The madd'ning ocean swells with furious roar, \n
See the devoted bark, the shatter'd mast, \n
The splitting hulk dash'd on the rocky shore, \n
Rolls 'midst the howlings of the direful blast. \n
O'er the vex'd deep the vivid sulphur flies, \n
The jarring elements their clamours blend, \n
The deaf'ning thunder roars along the skies, \n
And whistling winds from lurid clouds descend. \n
The lab'ring wreck, contending with the wave, \n
Mounts to the blast, or plunges in the main, \n
The trembling wretch suspended o'er his grave, \n
Clings to the tatter'd shrouds, the pouring rain \n
Chills his sad breast, methinks I see him weep, \n
I hear his fearful groan his mutter'd pray'r, \n
O, cease to mourn, behold the yawning deep \n
Where soon thy weary soul shall mock Despair, \n
Yes, soon thy aching heart shall rest in peace, \n
For in the arms of Death all human sorrows cease. \n<|endoftext|>

Alas, I'll never know, \n
To my regret. \n
In some rhyme-book I've read, \n
A lady bard has said, \n
And deemed it true, \n
Men will not bite the necks \n
Of sweeties who wear specs,-- \n
Young man, would you? \n
But though they balk romance, \n
Columbus took a chance, \n
And so would I; \n
Even with orbs unseen \n
I'd fain make you my queen \n
And you en-sky. \n
Alas I see you go, \n
And I will never know \n
Your pupils tint; \n
So o'er a lonely drink \n
I force myself to think: \n
Damsel, you squint! \n<|endoftext|>

The dark cloud. \n
It sits around your head \n
or inside it, more like. \n
Around your mind, \n
or inside it. \n
Around your heart, \n
or inside it. \n
Does it reach your knees? \n
Seems like it, some days. \n
Your toenails perhaps? \n
If you let it, it has a voice. \n
Please don’t listen to it; \n
that’s really dangerous; \n
it makes general statements \n
as if it knows you better than you know yourself \n
like, ‘your…’ - no, it claims to BE you - \n
so, it’s ‘MY life is pointless..’ \n
Have you noticed, it’s \n
never in front of you, \n
always somewhere behind you, \n
whispering over your shoulder \n
so on a bad day, it’s there in the bed with you \n
the moment you awake; not of course \n
in kissing range, that might be fun – but behind you, \n
murmuring in a bedly voice \n
‘WE are really down this morning aren’t WE? ’ \n
or it catches up with you in the bathroom \n
or a bit later, like when you review the day’s appointments \n
or start out for work. \n
The First Aid for depression is of course well known \n
(to everyone else, at some other time…) : \n
put some music on, sing in the shower, \n
sit in the brightest light, \n
toast your hidden beautiful self \n
in orange juice; take some vigorous exercise, \n
seek out good company in \n
someone or something; be \n
good company yourself, for someone else.. \n
they all work, for a time; but don’t you wish \n
for the classic fairy tale encounter – \n
there you are walking through the dark wood \n
of the dark cloud, and suddenly \n
the monster springs out in front of you \n
in all its horror; for the first time \n
you meet it face to face; it’s \n
terrifying, but a curious relief: \n
now you know it’s not you after all, \n
but something else; you look it in the eye, \n
you don’t retreat, but march towards it, \n
say Boo (for linguistic reasons, rather abstruse) \n
and as you get nearer and nearer to it, the monster \n
gets smaller and smaller, until… \n
and then, marching back \n
triumphant with a spring in your step, \n
you may feel like \n
nailing it with a poem, to say \n
wow I’ve survived; \n
have a great day! \n<|endoftext|>
dark \n
Thick overhead \n
clouds of the monsoon, \n
a delight to this feverish heart. \n
Season of rain, \n
season of uncontrolled whispers---the Dark One's returning! \n
O swollen heart, \n
O sky brimming with moisture--- \n
tongued lightning first \n
and then thunder, \n
convulsive spatters of rain \n
and then wind, chasing the summertime heat. \n
Mira says: Dark One, \n
I've waited--- \n
it's time to take my songs \n

dark \n
Think not, because I wonder where you fled, \n
That I would lift a pin to see you there; \n
You may, for me, be prowling anywhere, \n
So long as you show not your little head: \n
No dark and evil story of the dead \n
Would leave you less pernicious or less fair— \n
Not even Lilith, with her famous hair; \n
And Lilith was the devil, I have read. \n
I cannot hate you, for I loved you then. \n
The woods were golden then. There was a road \n
Through beeches; and I said their smooth feet showed \n
Like yours. Truth must have heard me from afar, \n
For I shall never have to learn again \n
That yours are cloven as no beech’s are. \n<|endoftext|>
dark \n
I wake and feel the fell of dark, not day, \n
What hours, O what black hours we have spent \n
This night! what sights you, heart, saw; ways you went! \n
And more must, in yet longer light's delay. \n
With witness I speak this. But where I say \n
Hours I mean years, mean life. And my lament \n
Is cries countless, cries like dead letters sent \n
To dearest him that lives alas! away. \n
I am gall, I am heartburn. God's most deep decree \n
Bitter would have me taste: my taste was me; \n
Bones built in me, flesh filled, blood brimmed the curse. \n
Selfyeast of spirit a dull dough sours. I see \n
The lost are like this, and their scourge to be \n
As I am mine, their sweating selves; but worse. \n<|endoftext|>
dark \n
o \n
Huge vapours brood above the clifted shore, \n
Night on the ocean settles dark and mute, \n
Save where is heard the repercussive roar \n
Of drowsy billows on the rugged foot \n
Of rocks remote; or still more distant tone \n
Of seamen in the anchored bark that tell \n
The watch relieved; or one deep voice alone \n
Singing the hour, and bidding "Strike the bell!" \n
All is black shadow but the lucid line \n
Marked by the light surf on the level sand, \n
Or where afar the ship-lights faintly shine \n
Like wandering fairy fires, that oft on land \n
Misled the pilgrim--such the dubious ray \n
That wavering reason lends in life's long darkling way. \n

Your belongings are meager \n
As you wander loveless streets, \n
And the sidewalks kill your soul \n
When you have no place to sleep. \n
For a young child, \n
Life should be visionary dreams, \n
Not drug dens of demise \n
Where everyman has a predator’s eyes. \n
Life unravels for everyone in time, \n
But there should be happiness and joy \n
Intermingled in-between birth \n
And the onset of the inevitable obscene, \n
But some people get cast aside \n
The moment they leave their mother’s breast. \n<|endoftext|>

I'm blinded \n
When I scream \n
As I tumble through the darkness \n
Of my dream \n
Lost and lonely \n

And I'm all alone \n
Frightened and afraid \n
Full of fear \n
I reach out to escape \n
My eyes open with tears \n<|endoftext|>
dark \n
Dusk in the rain-soaked garden, \n
And dark the house within. \n
A door creaked: someone was early \n
To watch the dawn begin. \n
But he stole away like a thief \n
In the chilly, star-bright air: \n
Though the house was shuttered for slumber, \n
He had left one wakeful there. \n
Nothing moved in the garden. \n
Never a bird would sing, \n
Nor shake and scatter the dew from the boughs \n
With shy and startled wing. \n
But when that lover had passed the gate \n
A quavering thrush began... \n
‘Come back; come back!’ he shrilled to the heart \n
Of the passion-plighted man. \n<|endoftext|>

1 \n
Senlin sits before us, and we see him. \n
He smokes his pipe before us, and we hear him. \n
Is he small, with reddish hair, \n
Does he light his pipe with meditative stare, \n
And a pointed flame reflected in both eyes? \n
Is he sad and happy and foolish and wise? \n
Did no one see him enter the doors of the city, \n
Looking above him at the roofs and trees and skies? \n
'I stepped from a cloud', he says, 'as evening fell; \n
I walked on the sound of a bell; \n
I ran with winged heels along a gust; \n
Or is it true that I laughed and sprang from dust? . . . \n
Has no one, in a great autumnal forest, \n
When the wind bares the trees, \n
Heard the sad horn of Senlin slowly blown? \n
Has no one, on a mountain in the spring, \n
Heard Senlin sing? \n
Perhaps I came alone on a snow-white horse,-- \n
Riding alone from the deep-starred night. \n
Perhaps I came on a ship whose sails were music,-- \n
Sailing from moon or sun on a river of light.' \n
He lights his pipe with a pointed flame. \n
'Yet, there were many autumns before I came, \n
And many springs. And more will come, long after \n
There is no horn for me, or song, or laughter. \n
The city dissolves about us, and its walls \n
Become an ancient forest. There is no sound \n
Except where an old twig tires and falls; \n
Or a lizard among the dead leaves crawls; \n
Or a flutter is heard in darkness along the ground. \n
Has Senlin become a forest? Do we walk in Senlin? \n
Is Senlin the wood we walk in, --ourselves,--the world? \n
Senlin! we cry . . . Senlin! again . . . No answer, \n
Only soft broken echoes backward whirled . . . \n
Yet we would say: this is no wood at all, \n
But a small white room with a lamp upon the wall; \n
And Senlin, before us, pale, with reddish hair, \n
Lights his pipe with a meditative stare. \n
2 \n
Senlin, walking beside us, swings his arms \n
And turns his head to look at walls and trees. \n
The wind comes whistling from shrill stars of winter, \n
The lights are jewels, black roots freeze. \n
'Did I, then, stretch from the bitter earth like these, \n
Reaching upward with slow and rigid pain \n
To seek, in another air, myself again?' \n
(Immense and solitary in a desert of rocks \n
Behold a bewildered oak \n
With white clouds screaming through its leafy brain.) \n
'Or was I the single ant, or tinier thing, \n
That crept from the rocks of buried time \n
And dedicated its holy life to climb \n
From atom to beetling atom, jagged grain to grain, \n
Patiently out of the darkness we call sleep \n
Into a hollow gigantic world of light \n
Thinking the sky to be its destined shell, \n
Hoping to fit it well!--' \n
The city dissolves about us, and its walls \n
Are mountains of rock cruelly carved by wind. \n
Sand streams down their wasting sides, sand \n
Mounts upward slowly about them: foot and hand \n
We crawl and bleed among them! Is this Senlin? \n
In the desert of Senlin must we live and die? \n
We hear the decay of rocks, the crash of boulders, \n
Snarling of sand on sand. 'Senlin!' we cry. \n
'Senlin!' again . . . Our shadows revolve in silence \n
Under the soulless brilliance of blue sky. \n
Yet we would say: there are no rocks at all, \n
Nor desert of sand . . . here by a city wall \n
White lights jewell the evening, black roots freeze, \n
And Senlin turns his head to look at trees. \n
3 \n
It is evening, Senlin says, and in the evening, \n
By a silent shore, by a far distant sea, \n
White unicorns come gravely down to the water. \n
In the lilac dusk they come, they are white and stately, \n
Stars hang over the purple waveless sea; \n
A sea on which no sail was ever lifted, \n
Where a human voice was never heard. \n
The shadows of vague hills are dark on the water, \n
The silent stars seem silently to sing. \n
And gravely come white unicorns down to the water, \n
One by one they come and drink their fill; \n
And daisies burn like stars on the darkened hill. \n
It is evening Senlin says, and in the evening \n
The leaves on the trees, abandoned by the light, \n
Look to the earth, and whisper, and are still. \n
The bat with horned wings, tumbling through the darkness, \n
Breaks the web, and the spider falls to the ground. \n
The starry dewdrop gathers upon the oakleaf, \n
Clings to the edge, and falls without a sound. \n
Do maidens spread their white palms to the starlight \n
And walk three steps to the east and clearly sing? \n
Do dewdrops fall like a shower of stars from willows? \n
Has the small moon a ghostly ring? . . . \n
White skeletons dance on the moonlit grass, \n
Singing maidens are buried in deep graves, \n
The stars hang over a sea like polished glass . . . \n
And solemnly one by one in the darkness there \n
Neighing far off on the haunted air \n
White unicorns come gravely down to the water. \n
No silver bells are heard. The westering moon \n
Lights the pale floors of caverns by the sea. \n
Wet weed hangs on the rock. In shimmering pools \n
Left on the rocks by the receding sea \n
Starfish slowly turn their white and brown \n
Or writhe on the naked rocks and drown. \n
Do sea-girls haunt these caves--do we hear faint singing? \n
Do we hear from under the sea a faint bell ringing? \n
Was that a white hand lifted among the bubbles \n
And fallen softly back? \n
No, these shores and caverns are all silent, \n
Dead in the moonlight; only, far above, \n
On the smooth contours of these headlands, \n
White amid the eternal black, \n
One by one in the moonlight there \n
Neighing far off on the haunted air \n
The unicorns come down to the sea. \n
4 \n
Senlin, walking before us in the sunlight, \n
Bending his small legs in a peculiar way, \n
Goes to his work with thoughts of the universe. \n
His hands are in his pockets, he smokes his pipe, \n
He is happily conscious of roofs and skies; \n
And, without turning his head, he turns his eyes \n
To regard white horses drawing a small white hearse. \n
The sky is brilliant between the roofs, \n
The windows flash in the yellow sun, \n
On the hard pavement ring the hoofs, \n
The light wheels softly run. \n
Bright particles of sunlight fall, \n
Quiver and flash, gyrate and burn, \n
Honey-like heat flows down the wall, \n
The white spokes dazzle and turn. \n
Senlin, walking before us in the sunlight, \n
Regards the hearse with an introspective eye. \n
'Is it my childhood there,' he asks, \n
'Sealed in a hearse and hurrying by?' \n
He taps his trowel against a stone; \n
The trowel sings with a silver tone. \n
'Nevertheless I know this well. \n
Bury it deep and toll a bell, \n
Bury it under land or sea, \n
You cannot bury it save in me.' \n
It is as if his soul had become a city, \n
With noisily peopled streets, and through these streets \n
Senlin himself comes driving a small white hearse . . . \n
'Senlin!' we cry. He does not turn his head. \n
But is that Senlin?--Or is this city Senlin,-- \n
Quietly watching the burial of the dead? \n
Dumbly observing the cortège of its dead? \n
Yet we would say that all this is but madness: \n
Around a distant corner trots the hearse. \n
And Senlin walks before us in the sunlight \n
Happily conscious of his universe. \n
5 \n
In the hot noon, in an old and savage garden, \n
The peach-tree grows. Its cruel and ugly roots \n
Rend and rifle the silent earth for moisture. \n
Above, in the blue, hang warm and golden fruits. \n
Look, how the cancerous roots crack mould and stone! \n
Earth, if she had a voice, would wail her pain. \n
Is she the victim, or is the tree the victim? \n
Delicate blossoms opened in the rain, \n
Black bees flew among them in the sunlight, \n
And sacked them ruthlessly; and no a bird \n
Hangs, sharp-eyed, in the leaves, and pecks the fruit; \n
And the peach-tree dreams, and does not say a word. \n
. . . Senlin, tapping his trowel against a stone, \n
Observes this tree he planted: it is his own. \n
'You will think it strange,' says Senlin, 'but this tree \n
Utters profound things in this garden; \n
And in its silence speaks to me. \n
I have sensations, when I stand beneath it, \n
As if its leaves looked at me, and could see; \n
And those thin leaves, even in windless air, \n
Seem to be whispering me a choral music, \n
Insubstantial but debonair. \n
"Regard," they seem to say, \n
"Our idiot root, which going its brutal way \n
Has cracked your garden wall! \n
Ugly, is it not? \n
A desecration of this place . . . \n
And yet, without it, could we exist at all?" \n
Thus, rustling with importance, they seem to me \n
To make their apology; \n
Yet, while they apologize, \n
Ask me a wary question with their eyes. \n
Yes, it is true their origin is low-- \n
Brutish and dull and cruel . . . and it is true \n
Their roots have cracked the wall. But do we know \n
The leaves less cruel--the root less beautiful? \n
Sometimes it seems as if there grew \n
In the dull garden of my mind \n
A tree like this, which, singing with delicate leaves, \n
Yet cracks the wall with cruel roots and blind. \n
Sometimes, indeed, it appears to me \n
That I myself am such a tree . . .' \n
. . . And as we hear from Senlin these strange words \n
So, slowly, in the sunlight, he becomes this tree: \n
And among the pleasant leaves hang sharp-eyed birds \n
While cruel roots dig downward secretly. \n
6 \n
Rustling among his odds and ends of knowledge \n
Suddenly, to his wonder, Senlin finds \n
How Cleopatra and Senebtisi \n
Were dug by many hands from ancient tombs. \n
Cloth after scented cloth the sage unwinds: \n
Delicious to see our futile modern sunlight \n
Dance like a harlot among these Dogs and Dooms! \n
First, the huge pyramid, with rock on rock \n
Bloodily piled to heaven; and under this \n
A gilded cavern, bat festooned; \n
And here in rows on rows, with gods about them, \n
Cloudily lustrous, dim, the sacred coffins, \n
Silver starred and crimson mooned. \n
What holy secret shall we now uncover? \n
Inside the outer coffin is a second; \n
Inside the second, smaller, lies a third. \n
This one is carved, and like a human body; \n
And painted over with fish and bull and bird. \n
Here are men walking stiffly in procession, \n
Blowing horns or lifting spears. \n
Where do they march to? Where do they come from? \n
Soft whine of horns is in our ears. \n
Inside, the third, a fourth . . . and this the artist,-- \n
A priest, perhaps--did most to make resemble \n
The flesh of her who lies within. \n
The brown eyes widely stare at the bat-hung ceiling. \n
The hair is black, The mouth is thin. \n
Princess! Secret of life! We come to praise you! \n
The torch is lowered, this coffin too we open, \n
And the dark air is drunk with musk and myrrh. \n
Here are the thousand white and scented wrappings, \n
The gilded mask, and jeweled eyes, of her. \n
And now the body itself, brown, gaunt, and ugly, \n
And the hollow scull, in which the brains are withered, \n
Lie bare before us. Princess, is this all? \n
Something there was we asked that is not answered. \n
Soft bats, in rows, hang on the lustered wall. \n
And all we hear is a whisper sound of music, \n
Of brass horns dustily raised and briefly blown, \n
And a cry of grief; and men in a stiff procession \n
Marching away and softly gone. \n
7 \n
'And am I then a pyramid?' says Senlin, \n
'In which are caves and coffins, where lies hidden \n
Some old and mocking hieroglyph of flesh? \n
Or am I rather the moonlight, spreading subtly \n
Above those stones and times? \n
Or the green blade of grass that bravely grows \n
Between to massive boulders of black basalt \n
Year after year, and fades and blows? \n
Senlin, sitting before us in the lamplight, \n
Laughs, and lights his pipe. The yellow flame \n
Minutely flares in his eyes, minutely dwindles. \n
Does a blade of grass have Senlin for a name? \n
Yet we would say that we have seen him somewhere, \n
A tiny spear of green beneath the blue, \n
Playing his destiny in a sun-warmed crevice \n
With the gigantic fates of frost and dew. \n
Does a spider come and spin his gossamer ladder \n
Rung by silver rung, \n
Chaining it fast to Senlin? Its faint shadow \n
Flung, waveringly, where his is flung? \n
Does a raindrop dazzle starlike down his length \n
Trying his futile strength? \n
A snowflake startle him? The stars defeat him? \n
Through aeons of dusk have birds above him sung? \n
Time is a wind, says Senlin; time, like music, \n
Blows over us its mournful beauty, passes, \n
And leaves behind a shadowy reflection,-- \n
A helpless gesture of mist above the grasses. \n
8 \n
In cold blue lucid dusk before the sunrise, \n
One yellow star sings over a peak of snow, \n
And melts and vanishes in a light like roses. \n
Through slanting mist, black rocks appear and glow. \n
The clouds flow downward, slowly as grey glaciers, \n
Or up to a pale rose-azure pass. \n
Blue streams tinkle down from snow to boulders, \n
From boulders to white grass. \n
Icicles on the pine tree melt \n
And softly flash in the sun: \n
In long straight lines the star-drops fall \n
One by one. \n
Is a voice heard while the shadows still are long, \n
Borne slowly down on the sparkling air? \n
Is a thin bell heard from the peak of silence? \n
Is someone among the high snows there? \n
Where the blue stream flows coldly among the meadows \n
And mist still clings to rock and tree \n
Senlin walks alone; and from that twilight \n
Looks darkly up, to see \n
The calm unmoving peak of snow-white silence, \n
The rocks aflame with ice, the rose-blue sky . . . \n
Ghost-like, a cloud descends from twinkling ledges, \n
To nod before the dwindling sun and die. \n
'Something there is,' says Senlin, 'in that mountain, \n
Something forgotten now, that once I knew . . .' \n
We walk before a sun-tipped peak in silence, \n
Our shadows descend before us, long and blue. \n<|endoftext|>
dark \n
Under her dark veil she wrung her hands. \n
"Why are you so pale today?" \n
"Because I made him drink of stinging grief \n
Until he got drunk on it. \n
How can I forget? He staggered out, \n
His mouth twisted in agony. \n
I ran down not touching the bannister \n
And caught up with him at the gate. \n
I cried: 'A joke! \n
That's all it was. If you leave, I'll die.' \n
He smiled calmly and grimly \n
And told me: 'Don't stand here in the wind.' " \n<|endoftext|>

As far as I remembered, \n
We were friends since forever, \n
Each other we never hated \n
Because we controlled our temper \n
But slowly we separated \n
And our laughter slowly faded \n
Our communication failed to start \n
Birthday cards became belated \n
And although we are apart \n
You are still in my heart \n
But for our friendship I hold fear \n
It’s going down hill in a wheeled cart \n
I hope someday you will reappear \n
And someday that you’ll be near \n
For every night I cry tears \n

But then I think of why I haven’t done it \n
My mind searching for the answer \n
I find it \n
I haven’t done it because of people \n
I want to do it because of them \n
But they are what is keeping me alive \n
I feel it eating away more and more \n
Every time I sit here \n
I feel as if I can’t get out \n
Of this black hole of pain \n
I feel the cuts getting deeper \n

The scars that line your arms, \n
look like the intricate artwork of a tattooist, \n
those razor cuts and puncture wounds, \n
signs of a desparate cry for help. \n
That vacant look upon your face, \n
the doctors miracle cure; \n
Prozac, takes all your troubles away, \n
but all it does is pushes them deeper inside. \n

tears too many to number have been shed \n
Pain seems to be my constant companion \n
Misery always my only friend \n
Will anyone ever see past my imperfections \n
or find my spark that has been dormant all these years \n
Is there somebody in this world who can see through the masks \n
and discover the beauty that this weary soul posseses \n
My heart is tired of the rigid solitude \n
my mind is ready for the sun that only Love can bring \n
but if this hopeless dream shall ever be fulfilled \n

A young mother waits lonely, \n
But with war it didn’t start. \n
It began with a with a duty, \n
To country and heart. \n
With her husband at war, \n
Things are not as they seem. \n
Lonely days are without end, \n
Like its some kind of dream. \n
It seems even living, \n
Gets more difficult each day. \n
And in each daily letter. \n
Things are harder to say. \n
No more grand parades, \n
No excitement to bring. \n
Even so if there were, \n
It wouldn’t change a thing. \n
Alone with no husband, \n
No family and no friends, \n
Just another young mother, \n
Alone in the end. \n

lonely \n
I wandered lonely as a cloud \n
That floats on high o'er vales and hills, \n
When all at once I saw a crowd, \n
A host, of golden daffodils; \n
Beside the lake, beneath the trees, \n
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze. \n
Continuous as the stars that shine \n
And twinkle on the milky way, \n
They stretched in never-ending line \n
Along the margin of a bay: \n
Ten thousand saw I at a glance, \n
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance. \n
The waves beside them danced; but they \n
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee: \n
A poet could not but be gay, \n
In such a jocund company: \n
I gazed- and gazed- but little thought \n
What wealth the show to me had brought: \n
For oft, when on my couch I lie \n
In vacant or in pensive mood, \n
They flash upon that inward eye \n
Which is the bliss of solitude; \n
And then my heart with pleasure fills, \n
And dances with the daffodils. \n<|endoftext|>

It is now old and in need of paint \n
Sits alone in a field of grass \n
Poor little lonely one room school \n
So long ago since it’s had class \n
If only it could tell us stories \n
Of the children who sat in its seats \n
Buzzing with exciting chatter \n
Never thinking they’d face defeat \n
School books worn on the corners \n
For turning down pages a thing to do \n
Buckets design for their small lunches \n
Old-fashioned hats that set askew \n
Oh listen, can you hear the laughter? \n
Reciting their lessons every day \n
Recess time in the school yard \n
It was important to take time to play \n
But you know, nothing lasts forever \n
Except, of course, the golden rule \n
I feel a bit sad when I look upon \n
This precious lonely one room school! \n<|endoftext|>

She ran towards me \n
On her face was a huge glee \n
She looked at her mummy and plead \n
“I want him mummy” she said \n
“I’ll name him Jim \n
I’ll play with him \n
I’ll take him for walks \n
I’ll make him stay away from your frocks \n
I’ll make him clean \n
Like a king I’ll let him reign \n
And Julie will be his queen \n
I’ll teach him tricks \n

I’ll look after him when he is sick \n
I’ll always be there for him \n
He’ll be my only Jim \n
Please mummy \n

Her mummy replied with a yes \n
And I knew me, god really did bless \n
I stood away from mess \n
And I bent towards my new mistress \n
She came towards me \n
But moved to my right; \n
Where Rawky, my friend was sitting \n
She took him in her arms and said \n
“Thank you mama, \n
Thanks for letting me keep Jim” \n
My dreams were shattered \n
It was not me whom she wanted \n

And closed my dark eyes \n

Alone in this lonely world \n
Because I am just a dog \n

moonlight. \n
Spirit of Beauty, how could you, whose radiance overbrims the \n

From reality \n
For your love of me \n

For how can I rest \n

To be the best in your eyes \n
Is my only goal \n
To be the tree \n
In your flowering atoll \n
I will best him \n
I'll find a way \n
I'll show you the true power \n
Of love someday \n
But now I lie \n
In the shadows, alone \n
Making amends \n
And peacefully atoning \n
For I know what I've done \n
And what I plan to do \n
All for the sake of you \n
So forever I struggle \n

Unknown paths to tread \n

lonely \n
So Eden was deserted, and at eve \n
Into the quiet place God came to grieve. \n
His face was sad, His hands hung slackly down \n
Along his robe; too sorrowful to frown \n
He paced along the grassy paths and through \n
The silent trees, and where the flowers grew \n
Tended by Adam. All the birds had gone \n
Out to the world, and singing was not one \n
To cheer the lonely God out of His grief -- \n
The silence broken only when a leaf \n
Tapt lightly on a leaf, or when the wind, \n
Slow-handed, swayed the bushes to its mind. \n
And so along the base of a round hill, \n
Rolling in fern, He bent His way until \n
He neared the little hut which Adam made, \n
And saw its dusky rooftree overlaid \n
With greenest leaves. Here Adam and his spouse \n
Were wont to nestle in their little house \n
Snug at the dew-time: here He, standing sad, \n
Sighed with the wind, nor any pleasure had \n
In heavenly knowledge, for His darlings twain \n
Had gone from Him to learn the feel of pain, \n
And what was meant by sorrow and despair, -- \n
Drear knowledge for a Father to prepare. \n
There he looked sadly on the little place; \n
A beehive round it was, without a trace \n
Of occupant or owner; standing dim \n
Among the gloomy trees it seemed to Him \n
A final desolation, the last word \n
Wherewith the lips of silence had been stirred. \n
Chaste and remote, so tiny and so shy, \n
So new withal, so lost to any eye, \n
So pac't of memories all innocent \n
Of days and nights that in it had been spent \n
In blithe communion, Adam, Eve, and He, \n
Afar from Heaven and its gaudery; \n
And now no more! He still must be the God \n
But not the friend; a Father with a rod \n
Whose voice was fear, whose countenance a threat, \n
Whose coming terror, and whose going wet \n
With penitential tears; not evermore \n
Would they run forth to meet Him as before \n
With careless laughter, striving each to be \n
First to His hand and dancing in their glee \n
To see Him coming -- they would hide instead \n
At His approach, or stand and hang the head, \n
Speaking in whispers, and would learn to pray \n
Instead of asking, 'Father, if we may.' \n
Never again to Eden would He haste \n
At cool of evening, when the sun had paced \n
Back from the tree-tops, slanting from the rim \n
Of a low cloud, what time the twilight dim \n
Knit tree to tree in shadow, gathering slow \n
Till all had met and vanished in the flow \n
Of dusky silence, and a brooding star \n
Stared at the growing darkness from afar, \n
While haply now and then some nested bird \n
Would lift upon the air a sleepy word \n
Most musical, or swing its airy bed \n
To the high moon that drifted overhead. \n
'Twas good to quit at evening His great throne, \n
To lay His crown aside, and all alone \n
Down through the quiet air to stoop and glide \n
Unkenned by angels: silently to hide \n
In the green fields, by dappled shades, where brooks \n
Through leafy solitudes and quiet nooks \n
Flowed far from heavenly majesty and pride, \n
From light astounding and the wheeling tide \n
Of roaring stars. Thus does it ever seem \n
Good to the best to stay aside and dream \n
In narrow places, where the hand can feel \n
Something beside, and know that it is real. \n
His angels! silly creatures who could sing \n
And sing again, and delicately fling \n
The smoky censer, bow and stand aside \n
All mute in adoration: thronging wide, \n
Till nowhere could He look but soon He saw \n
An angel bending humbly to the law \n
Mechanic; knowing nothing more of pain, \n
Than when they were forbid to sing again, \n
Or swing anew the censer, or bow down \n
In humble adoration of His frown. \n
This was the thought in Eden as He trod -- \n
. . . It is a lonely thing to be a God. \n
So long! afar through Time He bent His mind, \n
For the beginning, which He could not find, \n
Through endless centuries and backwards still \n
Endless forever, till His 'stonied will \n
Halted in circles, dizzied in the swing \n
Of mazy nothingness. -- His mind could bring \n
Not to subjection, grip or hold the theme \n
Whose wide horizon melted like a dream \n
To thinnest edges. Infinite behind \n
The piling centuries were trodden blind \n
In gulfs chaotic -- so He could not see \n
When He was not who always had To Be. \n
Not even godly fortitude can stare \n
Into Eternity, nor easy bear \n
The insolent vacuity of Time: \n
It is too much, the mind can never climb \n
Up to its meaning, for, without an end, \n
Without beginning, plan, or scope, or trend \n
To point a path, there nothing is to hold \n
And steady surmise: so the mind is rolled \n
And swayed and drowned in dull Immensity. \n
Eternity outfaces even Me \n
With its indifference, and the fruitless year \n
Would swing as fruitless were I never there. \n
And so for ever, day and night the same, \n
Years flying swiftly nowhere, like a game \n
Played random by a madman, without end \n
Or any reasoned object but to spend \n
What is unspendable -- Eternal Woe! \n
O Weariness of Time that fast or slow \n
Goes never further, never has in view \n
An ending to the thing it seeks to do, \n
And so does nothing: merely ebb and flow, \n
From nowhere into nowhere, touching so \n
The shores of many stars and passing on, \n
Careless of what may come or what has gone. \n
O solitude unspeakable! to be \n
For ever with oneself! never see \n
An equal face, or feel an equal hand, \n
To sit in state and issue reprimand, \n
Admonishment or glory, and to smile \n
Disdaining what has happenèd the while! \n
O to be breast to breast against a foe! \n
Against a friend! to strive and not to know \n
The laboured outcome: love nor be aware \n
How much the other loved, and greatly care \n
With passion for that happy love or hate, \n
Nor know what joy or dole was hid in fate. \n
For I have ranged the spacy width and gone \n
Swift north and south, striving to look upon \n
An ending somewhere. Many days I sped \n
Hard to the west, a thousand years I fled \n
Eastwards in fury, but I could not find \n
The fringes of the Infinite. Behind \n
And yet behind, and ever at the end \n
Came new beginnings, paths that did not wend \n
To anywhere were there: and ever vast \n
And vaster spaces opened -- till at last \n
Dizzied with distance, thrilling to a pain \n
Unnameable, I turned to Heaven again. \n
And there My angels were prepared to fling \n
The cloudy incense, there prepared to sing \n
My praise and glory -- O, in fury I \n
Then roared them senseless, then threw down the sky \n
And stamped upon it, buffeted a star \n
With my great fist, and flung the sun afar: \n
Shouted My anger till the mighty sound \n
Rung to the width, frighting the furthest bound \n
And scope of hearing: tumult vaster still, \n
Throning the echo, dinned My ears, until \n
I fled in silence, seeking out a place \n
To hide Me from the very thought of Space. \n
And so, He thought, in Mine own Image I \n
Have made a man, remote from Heaven high \n
And all its humble angels: I have poured \n
My essence in his nostrils: I have cored \n
His heart with My own spirit; part of Me, \n
His mind with laboured growth unceasingly \n
Must strive to equal Mine; must ever grow \n
By virtue of My essence till he know \n
Both good and evil through the solemn test \n
Of sin and retribution, till, with zest, \n
He feels his godhead, soars to challenge Me \n
In Mine own Heaven for supremacy. \n
Through savage beasts and still more savage clay, \n
Invincible, I bid him fight a way \n
To greater battles, crawling through defeat \n
Into defeat again: ordained to meet \n
Disaster in disaster; prone to fall, \n
I prick him with My memory to call \n
Defiance at his victor and arise \n
With anguished fury to his greater size \n
Through tribulation, terror, and despair. \n
Astounded, he must fight to higher air, \n
Climb battle into battle till he be \n
Confronted with a flaming sword and Me. \n
So growing age by age to greater strength, \n
To greater beauty, skill and deep intent: \n
With wisdom wrung from pain, with energy \n
Nourished in sin and sorrow, he will be \n
Strong, pure and proud an enemy to meet, \n
Tremendous on a battle-field, or sweet \n
To walk by as friend with candid mind. \n
--Dear enemy or friend so hard to find, \n
I yet shall find you, yet shall put My breast \n
In enmity or love against your breast: \n
Shall smite or clasp with equal ecstasy \n
The enemy or friend who grows to Me. \n
The topmost blossom of his growing I \n
Shall take unto Me, cherish and lift high \n
Beside myself upon My holy throne: -- \n
It is not good for God to be alone. \n
The perfect woman of his perfect race \n
Shall sit beside Me in the highest place \n
And be my Goddess, Queen, Companion, Wife, \n
The rounder of My majesty, the life \n
Of My ambition. She will smile to see \n
Me bending down to worship at her knee \n
Who never bent before, and she will say, \n
'Dear God, who was it taught Thee how to pray?" \n
And through eternity, adown the slope \n
Of never-ending time, compact of hope, \n
Of zest and young enjoyment, I and She \n
Will walk together, sowing jollity \n
Among the raving stars, and laughter through \n
The vacancies of Heaven, till the blue \n
Vast amplitudes of space lift up a song, \n
The echo of our presence, rolled along \n
And ever rolling where the planets sing \n
The majesty and glory of the King. \n
Then conquered, thou, Eternity, shalt lie \n
Under My hand as little as a fly. \n
I am the Master: I the mighty God \n
And you My workshop. Your pavilions trod \n
By Me and Mine shall never cease to be, \n
For you are but the magnitude of Me, \n
The width of My extension, the surround \n
Of My dense splendour. Rolling, rolling round, \n
To steeped infinity, and out beyond \n
My own strong comprehension, you are bond \n
And servile to My doings. Let you swing \n
More wide and ever wide, you do but fling \n
Around the instant Me, and measure still \n
The breadth and proportion of My Will. \n
Then stooping to the hut -- a beehive round -- \n
God entered in and saw upon the ground \n
The dusty garland, Adam, (learned to weave) \n
Had loving placed upon the head of Eve \n
Before the terror came, when joyous they \n
Could look for God at closing of the day \n
Profound and happy. So the Mighty Guest \n
Rent, took, and placed the blossoms in His breast. \n
'This,' said He gently, 'I shall show My queen \n
When she hath grown to Me in space serene, \n
And say "'twas worn by Eve."' So, smiling fair, \n
He spread abroad His wings upon the air. \n<|endoftext|>

False hope prolongs my ever certain grief, \n
Trait'rous to me and faithful to my love; \n
A thousand times it promis'd me relief, \n

Oft when I find in her no truth at all, \n

Yet soon again I must her back recall, \n
As one that dies without her company. \n
Thus often as I chase my hope from me, \n
Straight way she hastes her unto Delia's eyes; \n
Fed with some pleasing look there shall she be, \n
And so sent back, and thus my fortune lies. \n

You may think your career is in a crossroads. \n
You may think that you have made bad choices. \n
You may even think that life is full of shit. \n
But know this, \n
Whatever happens, happens for a reason. \n
You are here for a reason. \n
There is a purpose for your existence. \n
Think of this whenever you feel down, whenever you feel that that life sucks. \n
Everything happens for the Greater good, \n
Always think of this after every failure. \n

hope \n
There is always hope for tomorrow \n
We start a brand new day \n
No one knows what is in store \n
As we live our lives in every which way \n
We must keep our heads up \n
And accentuate the positive \n
That is the attitude that we must have \n
Because we all have one life to live \n<|endoftext|>
hope \n
'Hope' is the thing with feathers— \n
That perches in the soul— \n
And sings the tune without the words— \n
And never stops—at all— \n
And sweetest—in the Gale—is heard— \n
And sore must be the storm— \n
That could abash the little Bird \n
That kept so many warm— \n
I've heard it in the chillest land— \n
And on the strangest Sea— \n
Yet, never, in Extremity, \n
It asked a crumb—of Me. \n<|endoftext|>

Grey street corner \n
A frozen room \n
Lonely bed \n
A dying moon \n
Litter swept streets \n
And templed stars \n
Blurred rising sun \n
Hits burnt out cars. \n
Hate scrawled text \n
On bricked in walls \n
From cancered branch \n
A last leaf falls \n
The knife drawn streets \n
Barred with shops, \n
The downward wound \n
That never stops. \n
A Frostbitten tree \n
A pock marked road. \n
First morning truck \n
With a heavy load. \n
Gun ruled streets \n
Of bricks and knives \n
Discarded dreams \n
And shattered lives. \n
A world of pain \n
A world of snow \n
Nowhere to leave \n
No place to go \n
With no hope \n
To a world forlorn \n
No route to life \n

hope \n
Hope is a tattered flag and a dream of time. \n
Hope is a heartspun word, the rainbow, the shadblow in white \n
The evening star inviolable over the coal mines, \n
The shimmer of northern lights across a bitter winter night, \n
The blue hills beyond the smoke of the steel works, \n
The birds who go on singing to their mates in peace, war, peace, \n
The ten-cent crocus bulb blooming in a used-car salesroom, \n
The horseshoe over the door, the luckpiece in the pocket, \n
The kiss and the comforting laugh and resolve— \n
Hope is an echo, hope ties itself yonder, yonder. \n
The spring grass showing itself where least expected, \n
The rolling fluff of white clouds on a changeable sky, \n
The broadcast of strings from Japan, bells from Moscow, \n
Of the voice of the prime minister of Sweden carried \n
Across the sea in behalf of a world family of nations \n
And children singing chorals of the Christ child \n
And Bach being broadcast from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania \n
And tall skyscrapers practically empty of tenants \n
And the hands of strong men groping for handholds \n
And the Salvation Army singing God loves us…. \n<|endoftext|>
hope \n
I’m searching the expansive, azure sky \n
For a woman’s anodyne brown eyes \n
That escaped from her face \n
To watch this place, \n
Keep my heartbeats and breaths in view, \n
Saying enlightened prayers \n
Into the compassionate air \n
Of God’s loving universe. \n
Everything is going to work \n
And ease the hurt \n
From a thousand wounds \n
Inflicted by yesterday’s knife. \n
The future is a healing balm \n
And a good luck charm \n
Against the darkness and disaster \n
Still looming in childhood \n
Gloomy clouds and unhappy nightmares. \n<|endoftext|>
hope \n
Love is one identifying mark that sets Believers and others apart. \n
Men will know us from others when we have love one for another. \n
Love covers a multitude of sin, when you have Christ’s love within. \n
It was Christ’s love on the cross that covered the sins of the lost. \n
No greater love to comprehend than giving one’s life for a friend. \n
In His love, God did condescend, saving sinners like us, my friend. \n
We display the love of Christ, when we become a living sacrifice. \n
It’s a reasonable service to Him; As His Love washed away our sin. \n
If in your life you give God His place, He will then fill you with faith. \n
This Faith centers upon Him; as Christ turns you from a life of sin. \n
Faith becomes your foundation, the moment you receive Salvation. \n
Friend in your newly found Faith, you will be led by God’s Grace. \n
And friend your Faith is assured, as you put your Hope in The Lord, \n
Not in your life or other men but Hope in the One who God did send. \n
For Christ is The Hope of all men, He is The Beginning and The End, \n
As Christ is The Hope of certainty, that goes on well into Eternity. \n
My friend, Faith, Hope and Love, they are all gifts from God up above, \n
And if you glean from up above, you will see that the greatest is Love. \n
God’s Love produces in us a Faith that helps us point to God’s Grace. \n
Grace appeared to all then, and Christ remains The Hope of all men. \n

PART I (excerpt) \n
Where barbarous hordes on Scythian mountains roam, \n
Truth, Mercy, Freedom, yet shall find a home; \n
Where'er degraded Nature bleeds and pines, \n
From Guinea's coast to Sibir's dreary mines, \n
Truth shall pervade the unfathomed darkness there, \n
And light the dreadful features of despair. \n
Hark! the stern captive spurns his heavy load, \n
And asks the image back that Heaven bestowed. \n
Fierce in his eye the fire of valour burns, \n
And, as the slave departs, the man returns. \n
Oh! sacred Truth! thy triumph ceased awhile, \n
And Hope, thy sister, ceased with thee to smile, \n
When leagued Oppression poured to Northern wars \n
Her whiskered pandoors and her fierce hussars, \n
Waved her dread standard to the breeze of morn, \n
Pealed her loud drum, and twanged her trumpet horn; \n
Tumultuous horror brooded o'er her van, \n
Presaging wrath to Poland--and to man! \n
Warsaw's last champion from her height surveyed \n
Wide o'er the fields, a waste of ruin laid; \n
"Oh! Heaven!" he cried, "my bleeding country save! \n
Is there no hand on high to shield the brave? \n
Yet, though destruction sweep these lovely plains, \n
Rise, fellow men! our country yet remains! \n
By that dread name we wave the sword on high, \n
And swear for her to live!--with her to die!" \n
He said, and on the rampart-heights arrayed \n
His trusty warriors, few but undismayed; \n
Firm-paced and slow, a horrid front they form, \n
Still as the breeze, but dreadful as the storm; \n
Low murmuring sounds along their banners fly, \n
Revenge, or death,--the watch-word and reply; \n
Then pealed the notes, omnipotent to charm, \n
And the loud tocsin tolled their last alarm! \n
In vain, alas! in vain, ye gallant few! \n
From rank to rank your volleyed thunder flew; \n
Oh, bloodiest picture in the book of Time, \n
Sarmatia fell, unwept, without a crime; \n
Found not a generous friend, a pitying foe, \n
Strength in her arms, nor mercy in her woe! \n
Dropped from her nerveless grasp the shattered spear, \n
Closed her bright eye, and curbed her high career,-- \n
Hope, for a season, bade the world farewell, \n
And Freedom shrieked--as Kosciusko fell! \n
The sun went down, nor ceased the carnage there. \n
Tumultuous murder shook the midnight air; \n
On Prague's proud arch the fires of ruin glow, \n
His blood-dyed waters murmuring far below; \n
The storm prevails, the rampart yields a way; \n
Bursts the wide cry of horror and dismay! \n
Hark! as the smouldering piles with thunder fall, \n
A thousand shrieks for hopeless mercy call! \n
Earth shook; red meteors flashed along the sky, \n
And conscious Nature shuddered at the cry! \n
Oh! righteous Heaven! ere Freedom found a grave, \n
Why slept the sword omnipotent to save? \n
Where was thine arm, O Vengeance! where thy rod, \n
That smote the foes of Zion and of God, \n
That crushed proud Ammon, when his iron car \n
Was yoked in wrath, and thundered from afar? \n
Where was the storm that slumbered till the host \n
Of blood-stained Pharaoh left their trembling coast, \n
Then bade the deep in wild commotion flow, \n
And heaved an ocean on their march below? \n
hope \n
All hope lies in tomorrow \n
Betrayed by yesterday \n
For every new horizon \n
There is a price to pay \n
The piper plays his tune \n
Holds out a hand for gilt \n
The memory cries a river \n
The wrong side of spilt milk \n
All hope lies in tomorrow \n
Forgetting yesterday \n
All hope is stored in thoughts \n
Arranged to form a play \n
There’s laughter and there’s intrigue \n
There’s sadness and there’s pain \n
Yet by the final act \n
Laughter rules again \n
All hope lies in tomorrow \n
Aphrodite by my side \n

Delusive Hope! more transient than the ray \n
That leads pale twilight to her dusky bed, \n
O'er woodland glen, or breezy mountain's head, \n
Ling'ring to catch the parting sigh of day. \n
Hence with thy visionary charms, away! \n
Nor o'er my path the flow'rs of fancy spread; \n
Thy airy dreams on peaceful pillows shed, \n
And weave for thoughtless brows, a garland gay. \n
Farewell low vallies; dizzy cliffs, farewell! \n
Small vagrant rills that murmur as ye flow: \n
Dark bosom'd labyrinth and thorny dell; \n
The task be mine all pleasures to forego; \n
To hide, where meditation loves to dwell, \n
And feed my soul, with luxury of woe! \n<|endoftext|>
hope \n
When the weary night is fled, \n
And the morning sky is red, \n
Then my heart doth rise and say, \n
`Surely she will come to-day.' \n
In the golden blaze of noon, \n
`Surely she is coming soon.' \n
In the twilight, `Will she come?' \n
Then my heart with fear is dumb. \n
When the night wind in the trees \n
Plays its mournful melodies, \n
Then I know my trust is vain, \n
And she will not come again. \n<|endoftext|>

hope \n
My banks they are furnish'd with bees, \n
Whose murmur invites one to sleep; \n
My grottos are shaded with trees, \n
And my hills are white-over with sheep. \n
I seldom have met with a loss, \n
Such health do my fountains bestow; \n
My fountains all border'd with moss, \n
Where the hare-bells and violets grow. \n
Not a pine in my grove is there seen, \n
But with tendrils of woodbine is bound: \n
Not a beech's more beautiful green, \n
But a sweet-briar entwines it around. \n
Not my fields, in the prime of the year, \n
More charms than my cattle unfold; \n
Not a brook that is limpid and clear, \n
But it glitters with fishes of gold. \n
One would think she might like to retire \n
To the bow'r I have labour'd to rear; \n
Not a shrub that I heard her admire, \n
But I hasted and planted it there. \n
O how sudden the jessamine strove \n
With the lilac to render it gay! \n
Already it calls for my love, \n
To prune the wild branches away. \n
From the plains, from the woodlands and groves, \n
What strains of wild melody flow! \n
How the nightingales warble their loves \n
From thickets of roses that blow! \n
And when her bright form shall appear, \n
Each bird shall harmoniously join \n
In a concert so soft and so clear, \n
As -- she may not be fond to resign. \n
I have found out a gift for my fair; \n
I have found where the wood-pigeons breed: \n
But let me that plunder forbear, \n
She will say 'twas a barbarous deed. \n
For he ne'er could be true, she aver'd, \n
Who could rob a poor bird of its young: \n
And I lov'd her the more, when I heard \n
Such tenderness fall from her tongue. \n
I have heard her with sweetness unfold \n
How that pity was due to -- a dove: \n
That it ever attended the bold; \n
And she call'd it the sister of love. \n
But her words such a pleasure convey, \n
So much I her accents adore, \n
Let her speak, and whatever she say, \n
Methinks I should love her the more. \n
Can a bosom so gentle remain \n
Unmov'd, when her Corydon sighs! \n
Will a nymph that is fond of the plain, \n
These plains and this valley despise? \n
Dear regions of silence and shade! \n
Soft scenes of contentment and ease! \n
Where I could have pleasingly stray'd, \n
If aught, in her absence, could please. \n
But where does my Phyllida stray? \n
And where are her grots and her bow'rs? \n
Are the groves and the valleys as gay, \n
And the shepherds as gentle as ours? \n
The groves may perhaps be as fair, \n
And the face of the valleys as fine; \n
The swains may in manners compare, \n
But their love is not equal to mine. \n<|endoftext|>

"Delicta juventutis et ignorantius ejus, quoesumus ne memineris, Domine." \n
I left, to earth, a little maiden fair, \n
With locks of gold, and eyes that shamed the light; \n
I prayed that God might have her in His care \n
And sight. \n
Earth's love was false; her voice, a siren's song; \n
(Sweet mother-earth was but a lying name) \n
The path she showed was but the path of wrong \n
And shame. \n
"Cast her not out!" I cry. God's kind words come -- \n
"Her future is with Me, as was her past; \n
It shall be My good will to bring her home \n
At last." \n<|endoftext|>

Hope is what makes us humans, hope is whats in our souls. \n
Each day that comes & goes. \n

I had a peanut butter sandwich today \n
which made me think of all the way.... \n
sssss my life has been touched by that \n
stick-to-your-mouth sludge of peanut fat. \n
Not 'touched' in the sense that it's shaped my life, \n
but when I open a jar and take up a knife \n
or a spoon, I can picture times of enjoy- \n
ment as an adult consumer and as a boy. \n
Of course I'm lucky in that I generally enjoy food \n
even if I'm in a rare bad mood. \n
I assume pb was a common snack in my childhood, \n
though I'm not sure it was. My memory is not that good. \n
But I do remember my Mom made cookies from it; \n
I helped her. And the first cooled cookie I'm sure I bit, \n
paying some attention to the crisscross pattern on top, \n
or the sometimes-present big chocolate drop. \n
And when I visited my childhood neighbor, Helen, it's a good bet \n
that sometimes a peanut butter sandwich I would get. \n
[But I really better remember that Helen's kitchen at times had cake. \n
I assume her mother, Betty, the cake did make.] \n
At Halloween there were pb 'cups' made by Reeses. \n
Chocolate and pb. It's good they were small pieces! \n
As an adult pb has been with me off and on. \n
Probably when I shared a home with my brother Don, \n
and when Shannon, my daughter, was young (that makes me smile) , \n
and when I lived in a storage garage for a short while. \n
I used to put it on plain warm toast, but \n
perhaps mixed-with-vanilla-ice cream I enjoyed it most. \n
I can't tell you how it would taste on sliced tomato, \n

And as I type today there's an unsealed jar nearby. \n
My wife cautions me against too much, but I'm not sure why. \n

There is good food and good bed. \n
There is fine wine and fine tune. \n
By is a cute lady with a melody. \n
You, as a king, are restless to taste. \n

The poor have taste, no means. \n
The rich have means, no taste. \n

So are you to my thoughts as food to life, \n
Or as sweet-seasoned showers are to the ground; \n
And for the peace of you I hold such strife \n
As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found. \n
Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon \n
Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure; \n
Now counting best to be with you alone, \n
Then bettered that the world may see my pleasure; \n
Sometimes all full with feasting on your sight, \n
And by and by clean starvèd for a look; \n
Possessing or pursuing no delight \n
Save what is had, or must from you be took. \n
Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day, \n
Or gluttoning on all, or all away. \n<|endoftext|>

For 2kms, now and I will be dead \n
For the morsel the world cannot reach me, \n

Why do these guys fight madly, \n
Brother to brother, friend to friend, \n
I and my type of folks live and die, \n
For the the beliefs and wrath \n
They carry, billions on arms are \n
Here to fight, but not a grain \n
To swallow, the land has become \n
Waterless and dry, even the rivers \n
have flown away, as if scared of \n
Human madness, Oh food, food \n
When will you appear for our hungry \n
Souls, which sure will go to heavens, \n
Since our penance are over forever, \n
And our sins have beeen wahed away \n
For all the humanity by our hunngry stomachs. \n<|endoftext|>

And now and then, I taste the foods I shouldn't; \n
So stupidly in utter disregard; \n
The things I loved to eat, some now I couldn't; \n
My allergy too has made me a Bard. \n
The sufferings that follow are so great; \n
I take the drugs to combat Allergy; \n
Of course, the symptoms do promptly abate; \n
But side-effects do steal my energy; \n
1 wish I had avoided the mistake; \n
I can’t be careful, all the time in life; \n
By miracle, if God-could only take, \n
Away the poison that adds to my strife. \n
Yet, blame I will myself for my sad plight; \n
How can a poison turn harmless o'er-night? \n<|endoftext|>
food \n
Mother, in some sad evening long ago, \n
From thy young breast my groping lips were taken, \n
Their hunger stilled, so soon again to waken, \n
But nevermore that holy food to know. \n
Ah! nevermore! for all the child might crave! \n
Ah! nevermore! through years unkind and dreary! \n
Often of other fare my lips are weary, \n
Unwearied once of what thy bosom gave. \n
(Poor wordless mouth that could not speak thy name! \n
At what unhappy revels has it eaten \n
The viands that no memory can sweeten, -- \n
The banquet found eternally the same!) \n
Then fell a shadow first on thee and me, \n
And tendrils broke that held us two how dearly! \n
Once infinitely thine, then hourly, yearly, \n
Less thine, as less the worthy thine to be. \n
(O mouth that yet should kiss the mouth of Sin! \n
Were lies so sweet, now bitter to remember? \n
Slow sinks the flame unfaithful to an ember; \n
New beauty fades and passion's wine is thin.) \n
How poor an end of that solicitude \n
And all the love I had not from another! \n
Peace to thine unforgetting heart, O Mother, \n
Who gav'st the dear and unremembered food! \n<|endoftext|>

It is all that we need \n

of our stomachs, \n
pangs that make us yawn \n
but cannot sleep \n
that make us gulp \n
but cannot vomit, \n
that make our saliva \n
taste sour and acidic! \n
We cry for food \n
like the helpless little children \n
with the art to attract attention \n
by our street demonstrations. \n
Yes, we cry for food like little children \n
to calm down our spirits, \n
that the cry cannot at all be neglected \n
for it is food, \n
it is food that soothes our spirits. \n
But you give us bullets \n
on the streets where we stage \n
our cry for food \n
You give us bullets \n
instead of food. \n
But even bullets cannot silence \n
our cry for food \n
for as long as we`re hungry \n
we shall be like little children \n

Sky was studded with dark clouds, \n
Rushing all over with big sounds, \n
Impeded danger of heavy down pour, \n
Adding of woes to already poor, \n

Why He was using the goodness? \n
Tearing apart the dark clouds, \n
Who were waiting for flash pounds? \n
She was kept bonded behind the dark, \n
Would have been freed with little spark? \n
There were silver lines ready to burst, \n
I had full faith and bestowed trust, \n
Suddenly it took dramatic turn, \n
Sun rays were making complete return, \n
Sky was lit with bright sun shine, \n
She stood there smiling for the while, \n
I couldn’t understand the simple massage, \n
Why clouds disappeared while making passage? \n
May be it was temporary phase? \n
I thanked God and took it with complete ease, \n
There was impeding danger like dark clouds, \n
I was slowly loosing my ground, \n
Love was HIS blessings and newly found, \n
All agreed for union and came round, \n
I wish it to happen with all my friends, \n
Who wished me success and flowers send? \n
My story was not success but had happy end, \n
Turning to HIM for success was not new but good trend \n<|endoftext|>

As after the darkest of nights is the brightest of days. \n
All doors are tightly locked, \n
Can’t be heard when knocked, \n
No where to go, \n
Nowhere to run, \n
Only wait in silence, \n
For death to come, \n

Look for the open door get up. \n
No water far far away in desert sand, \n
No sign of life but only bare land, \n
It’s a bluff of eye, water’s sight, \n
There is nothing there that can cause delight, \n
But don’t give up and don’t dismiss, \n
The chance of finding a desert oasis. \n

Candlelight. Always candlelight \n
We smile at the delicate eccentricity of our Friday folly \n
Our working week worked, still you court reflections. \n
And still, for the sake of your smile, I embroider the truth \n
Crafting my daytime drudgery into a compelling drama. \n
Comedic, tragic and teasing, I know that you know what is real \n
Yet in your eyes your enchantment is authentic and alluring \n
Lovingly and knowingly you liberate my penchant for amusing anecdotes \n
And in doing so my employ parallels the insipid and the inspiring \n
Strange bedfellows and, as I recall, such was once upon a time said of us. \n
Wine. Always a fine wine \n
We grin at the devilish extravagance we could ill-afford \n
Our working class veneer ajar to a shard of misplaced and, so you thought, \n
Secret snobbery, though I name dropp wines as others name dropp exotic holidays \n
For this is our weekly escape, our humble haven, nurtured with quirky formality, \n
We know our roles. I put down my case and loosen my tie to invite your culinary \n
Majesty through my veins as I place a kiss on your right cheek, the same cheek that you always offer. This is, I ponder, what you perceive to be your ‘Best Side’ and I smile as I see only two sides to your loveliness, your inside and your outside. I turn \n
t’wards the stairs and say, as I always say, “Be with you in a minute my lovely” \n
Silver. Always a breath on the silver. \n
We laugh at my Aladdin moment as I polish the cutlery in the same timid and tender way I would dress our children’s playground grazes as if I too was feeling their pain. The table plan, my table plan, fastidious and engraved to memory, is arranged with orderly angles and sterile lines. Did I ever ask you if it pleased you? Because, only now, can I concede the absence of any panache for the eye-catching that you could have so graciously and so effortlessly sprinkled upon the settings. The likelihood is I never did ask and, as is my want, I will have assumed that such precision and attention to detail would have impressed you. And as I see you tonight, in this light, so ageless and timeless I feel an overwhelming urge to say sorry. \n
Napkins. Always napkins. \n
We marvel at our blessings ‘neath willowy dancing flame. Our memoirs modest, \n
Our pleasures treasured and tonight, as ever, Friday ours. \n
Our children flown and, with lives of their own, we turn to pictures. Leafing through albums I carefully and, unsurprisingly, catalogued, I wonder. Did you ever feel the urge to blithely launch our lifetime memories skyward and gaily sit amongst their random landings? But sweet flower that you are you suffer and indulge my symmetry. \n
And now we are weary and I have talked too much so sleep safe my lovely for so shall I. \n
On this the fortieth anniversary of our marriage \n
And the fourth anniversary of your death. \n<|endoftext|>

I heard youth's silver clarion call to Fate, \n
And looking forth beheld his flower-fair face, \n
Framed in his shining helmet as he sat \n
Sheathed in white armour, full of fearless grace, \n
Watching the coming of a threat'ning cloud, \n
Hueless and shapeless, that with stealthy pace \n
Was creeping towards him. 'O dear youth, beware!' \n
But answer made he none save laugh'd aloud. \n
'Beware,' I cried, 'it hides some hideous snare.' \n
At it he made—and vanished in the shroud, \n
Whence there broke forth, O Christ! so sharp a cry \n
Of dire defeat and mortal agony, \n
That all my blood ran back in every vein; \n
And when th' accursed blackness roll'd away, \n
Prone in the dust my lovely warrior lay, \n
Defiled, not dead; sore wounded—shamed—not slain; \n
His shining armour smirched with many a stain, \n
Filthy and foul, ne'er to be bright again. \n<|endoftext|>

The milk has the hidden butter, \n
And this is a known factor, \n
But only when it's churned, \n
Up floats the butter turned. \n
The mind has the God hidden, \n
Amidst all the thoughts ridden, \n
But only when it turns clean \n
His vision inside can be seen. \n
A pure mind is always pure, \n
Despite a noble one falls poor, \n
Like a conch shell burnt in fire, \n
Still it remains white forever. \n
A diamond is the diamond best, \n
Even if it lies in a heap of dust, \n
And so shines a lotus found \n
That grows in a muddy pond. \n
The pure gold is heated up well, \n
Hammered before it gets its pull, \n
And twisted into different shapes \n
Of ornaments kept in shops. \n
The ups and downs we face, \n
In our life long endless race, \n
Are the God's golden efforts \n
So our Souls live in comforts. \n
Face any trouble with a smile, \n
For you're sure in the next mile, \n
To step over diamond or gold, \n
To brighten up your life, behold. \n<|endoftext|>

As one who often cares \n
for people \n
who suffer from \n
some terminal diseases \n
such as \n
leukaemia or myeloma, \n
who gets involved \n
in hushed discussions \n
with patients \n
and relatives \n
about \n
the end of life and \n
how it should be \n
managed...... \n
I'm very sad \n
that I am being asked, \n
just now and then, \n
to help end a life, \n
and feel that \n
if the law \n
were changed \n
this would destroy, \n
forever \n
the trust \n
I now enjoy \n
with human beings \n
such as these. \n
A quest for help \n
with ending \n
their own life, \n
takes away forever \n
any doctor- patient relationship \n
For the worse. \n
It spells \n
the end of it.. \n
Each patient \n
with a ‘final illness’ \n
or even \n
a chronic disabling one \n
like cancer, \n
heart attack, \n
Alzheimer's \n
begins to \n
feel the pressure \n
to request this \n
euthanasia, \n
which is suicide’ \n
assisted by the patient, \n
perhaps \n
in the coercive hope \n
of ending \n
a noticeable burden \n
on family, \n
perhaps society, \n
by not continuing \n
to be around. \n
Many will begin \n
to wonder whether \n
they should talk about \n
this euthanasia. \n
Oh, the pressure, \n
to do what's 'fair '. \n
And is it good enough \n
to say that \n
there will be \n
the safeguard of \n
two doctors, \n
a cooling off, \n
and prayer, \n
consultation? \n
Yes, we need \n
better dying \n
in today's world. \n
After all, \n
we deserve better \n
than our forefathers. \n
Or do we? \n
A better death \n
can be achieved, \n
not by \n
the building of \n
hospices, \n
improved palliative care, \n
more qualified staff, \n
education of all, \n
but by the provision of \n
narcotics to make, \n
as the song says, \n
the pain go away. \n
There is no need \n
for euthanasia, \n
for suicide, \n
for that nudge \n
that is good for all concerned, \n
and most of all, \n
to end the suffering. \n
Death, \n
you are the enemy, \n
no doctor ever should \n
consider fraternising \n
with you, \n
the helping hand \n
that you require \n
must come from \n
either God \n
or on the other side \n
from El Diablo. \n
Only those two \n
can be exempt \n
from being \n
murderers. \n<|endoftext|>
suicide \n
Is suicide really suicide or death with a cause \n
I mean were not breaking any laws \n
You hate us because we’re different and we dress in black \n
Because we’re filled with emotion but in conversation we lack \n
These scar’s we make heal our pain \n
And stop us going insane \n
Better to make our blood drip then to spill the lot \n
Dying happy is fine but living depressed is not \n
But in the end the choice is yours \n
Is suicide really suicide or death with a cause \n<|endoftext|>

I knew it was quicker \n
I quickly wrote my farewell note \n
Nothing was or went right \n
Anything that could go wrong did \n
I am often depressed \n

suicide \n
Suicide isn't fun, \n
so don't try it. \n
Suicide isn't quick, \n
it's long and painful. \n
Suicde never used to be me, \n
but now it is. \n
Suicide was never calming, \n
always away to have so much pain it didn't hurt anymore. \n
Suicide has to be a blade, \n
so don't get pricked. \n
Suicide is apart of love, \n
so don't love the wrong people. \n
Suicide and death are close, \n
so don't flirt with them. \n
Suicide never tells the the truth, \n
always belive the opposite. \n
Suicide kills slowly, \n
keep that in mind. \n
Suicide will always be here, \n
so get used to it. \n
Suicide takes over, \n
don't let it. \n
Suicide will eventually bite you, \n
bite back harder. \n
Suicide will never die, \n
you will but it won't be to it. \n
Suicide works well with your wrist, \n
so don't let it. \n
Suicide is always there you just can't see it, \n
so open your eyes. \n<|endoftext|>
suicide \n
I've been hurt and I've felt deep pain \n
But suicide wasn't ever my gain \n
To think that someone has no other choice \n
Please know I care, let me be your voice \n
I've been pretty down and very low \n
Thought about it myself, would be such a blow \n
To people who I loved and people who care \n
They would blame themselves, think they caused their share \n
You're hurting now over some lost love \n
Find your self another, that you can be proud of \n
I can't see the future, I'm only human I know \n
But killing yourself is no way to go \n
They are not worth you feeling so sad \n
Continue your life and you will be glad \n
Maybe they really aren't worth your time \n
Out of the darkness you will climb \n
Never love another more than yourself \n
Or you'll find yourself sitting on a lonely shelf! \n<|endoftext|>

Here I sit and write this poem \n
Thinking of all I love and all I hate \n
Thoughts of suicide thinking its my fate \n
I think of all the times I used to laugh \n
And now I wish I'd just die \n
How did so much misery come in to my life \n
And now all I have are thoughts of suicide \n
Crying every night is not the way to live \n
Heck I'm still a kid \n
I should be out hanging with all my friends \n
But these thoughts of suicide haunt my head \n
Will they care when I am gone \n
When nothings left expect my thoughts \n
And this small poem telling everyone \n
I will be no more in about an hour \n
Don't try to save me \n
Just save your tears \n
Nothing can stop me \n
Because i have thoughts of suicide \n
Heres to the end my dear friend \n
I hope you live life through \n
This is the end to this girls life \n
And all her thoughts to boot \n
Nothing there but my thoughts my secret thoughts of suicide \n<|endoftext|>

with all their little cliques \n
calling me fat and ugly \n

yes, yes I understand \n

can you stay on the line \n
I need to put you on hold \n
I'm sorry but I just have to \n
there's a call I need to answer \n
a ten year old wants to die \n
he's been diagnosed with cancer \n
then there's a woman \n
who wants to end it all \n
her ex boyfriend raped her \n
then broke her jaw \n
next, I have a couple \n
who had a son die in Iraq \n
they no longer want to live \n

suicide \n
Thoughts of suicide rush my head \n
Nobody knows when I’m here or there \n
A few slits of the wrist and ill soon be dead \n
Whatever I do, no one will care \n
I have no life \n
The little I have I live in strife \n
No one to miss me \n
No one to care \n
No one to love me \n
No love to share \n
I just wish I could burn \n
And still no ones concerned \n
Nothing but death on my mind \n
That’s all there ever seems to be \n
Can’t I find some one kind? \n
Someone to help me \n
Can’t someone let me out? \n
It just always makes me want to shout \n
Maybe they think I am a waste of time \n
That I’m just a hopeless cause \n
To cheer me up, I’ve found nothing sublime \n
Its all flashing by so fast, I need to hit pause \n
My chance at a life is lost \n
I must end this now, at all costs \n
My time here is gone today \n
Wasted and tragic \n
Just lost and blown away \n
To fix this could only be magic \n
My life here has been a waste \n
To help me would be in awful taste \n
I feel alone \n
This world is cruel \n
Emotionless as stone \n
Am I just God’s tool? \n

A suicide note is the hardest to wright \n
looking around to see if there is any one in sight \n
you know you have planed this, now for many days \n
because of the pain, real in so many ways. \n
Youre ready for this, right here and right now \n
you want to die but dont know how \n
what will they say \n
knowing you died this way \n
with youre own two hands \n
death is all youre mind demands. \n
At the very last moment there could ever be \n
You look in the mirror and all you could see \n
was the look and her face as the tears rolled down \n
staring at you with that penetrating frown \n
What should you do, now thats shes seen \n
how her sister will die only as a teen. \n
She asks you to stop \n
she treghtens to call a cop \n
She cant bear the thought of living alone \n
having no one to talk to over the phone \n
the tears keep flowing \n
as her voice keeps going \n
praying out loud \n
there is now a huge croud \n
in front of you \n
theres nothing to do. \n
You turn around and hug her \n
because between life and death living with her is now what you prefer. \n<|endoftext|>
suicide \n
A maggot, high up in a tree, \n
lived there with family of ten, \n
in roomy hollows of decay \n
and she remembered back to when \n
her husband had, while sound asleep, \n
rolled out of bed and fell to ground. \n
He broke his neck, the fall was steep \n
and lay there, still, without a sound \n
until a bird had picked him up \n
to take him back to sparrow's nest. \n
Announced 'You kids, I have some grub'. \n
Meanwhile our maggotmum got dressed \n
and told her kids to stay indoor, \n
while she would go to Rabbit' Heaven, \n
where cabbage could be had, and more. \n
She would be back around eleven \n
with food to feed their hungry mouths. \n
So, off she went and down the tree, \n
in early morn' she ventured south. \n
At the horizon she could see \n
the greenest fields and garden plots. \n
So, being careful, mark my words, \n
she watched for giant juggernauts, \n
but most of all she feared the birds. \n
The cabbage patch looked appetising, \n
she stuffed her pockets to the hilt, \n
and in the East the sun was rising, \n
she'd hurry or the food would wilt. \n
And, once again, she stayed alert, \n
got to the bottom of her tree, \n
worn out and swollen feet that hurt, \n
yet up she climbed the same as he \n
-her husband- always had ascended: \n
One foot, of many, up a notch, \n
then roll your body sideways, splendid. \n
It guarantees you speed as such. \n
And, when she rested at the door, \n
there was no sound from the inside. \n
She called her kids, then called some more, \n
fear dilated her pupils wide. \n
And then, the biggest, foulest mess \n
of bird poo that she'd ever see \n
was right in front of her distress. \n
And so she turned - jumped off the tree. \n<|endoftext|>
suicide \n
Why commit suicide? \n
Don’t tie yourself with a rope \n
With life, there is always hope \n
With life, there is always scope \n
Why commit suicide? \n
For you there is no roller coaster life ride \n
Your heart is filled with an empty hole so wide \n
Don’t put yourself on fire and fry \n
With life, you can still make an effort and try \n
Please leave us not with a permanent goodbye \n
Why commit suicide? \n
Believe me when I say ‘You are not alone’ \n
Many out there are shivering cold to the bone \n
Express your feelings to someone on the phone \n
Full of debt \n
Never properly slept \n
Always sadly wept \n
Wish you had something wonderful \n
You could have treasured and kept \n
Unsucessfuly with exams \n
After hectic midnight crams \n
Who gives a damn! \n
You are not alone! \n
You are not alone! \n
So you feel so empty inside \n
You are full of egoistical pride \n
To admit the thought of a suicide tide \n
Love has never even been on your side \n
Believe me when I say ‘You are not alone’ \n
With life, there is no stone \n
That you cannot eventually overthrow \n
To reclaim your rightful throne \n
So why commit suicide? \n

The night was dark and damp and cold. \n
The match girl’s matches still unsold. \n
The passers by ignored her pleas \n
what she was selling failed to please. \n
An orphan child without a home. \n
By circumstances forced to roam \n
She earns enough to pay her way \n
but not today, but not today. \n
Ill clad in rags and frozen through \n
her tiny hands and feet are blue. \n
The freezing rain turns into snow \n
The match girl has nowhere to go. \n
Without money, she cannot buy \n
a night in somewhere warm and dry. \n
She tries in vain to sell her wares \n
Without success, nobody cares. \n
The falling snow was getting deep \n
and still she had no place to sleep. \n
Although she tried in vain to find \n
some shelter from the freezing wind. \n
This was the night the match girl died. \n
They found her frozen stiff beside \n
the local convents well barred door. \n
The little Sisters of the Poor. \n
Had not been very sisterly. \n
Ignored the orphans misery \n
because they did not choose to see. \n
Now kindly death has set her free. \n
No longer needs the charity \n
which they denied so easily \n
by pious women who profess \n
to proffer aid to the helpless. \n
I do not claim to be guilt free \n
but I make no pretence to be \n
a Little sister of the poor \n
and let a child freeze at my door. \n
I am quite sure they will \n
deny any responsibility \n
and call her death an accident. \n
They could nothing to prevent. \n
I should not judge but feel I must \n
express my feelings of disgust \n
That this child was allowed to die \n
for lack of Christian charity. \n
Although this happened long ago \n
There’s very little changed I know. \n
We’re still prepared to pass them by \n
and care not if they live or die. \n
We can pretend they don’t exist \n
an attitude which will persist \n
As long as we don’t choose to see \n
They’re our responsibility. \n

So that's what it's like for every warning \n
For it hurts with an aplomb \n
Just as the chances are gone \n
Final time of never fair \n
Even if it's true that you couldn't even care \n
Letting me have secrets that I'll keep \n
Not sure when to break free \n
Just not with a bliss \n
Guess you'll never finally want to see \n
Even though it happens as every warning \n
Letting you just push me to my final limit \n
Like trying to break myself ever free \n
So that's what it's like for every warning \n
So there's no-one who can finally even see \n
Low as you hurt me but that's further debatable, debatable \n
And that'll be nothing that's ever new \n
No way of making love due so \n
Even though it happens as every warning \n

Deah Ladies, \n
Let me wawn you, theah are feahful taimes to come, \n
And a mos' ter-ific strugge is at hand; \n
And we have no taime to speah \n
If we wish to do ouah sheah \n
To defend, like Joan of Awk, ouah native land. \n
Foah a really fraightful monstah is preparing to devouah \n
All that's uppab-clauss and propah and quaite naice; \n
And if we should be behaind \n
In the battle aye shall faind \n
All ouah priveleges vanish in a traice. \n
O, it makes me shuddah, ladies, when Ai ventuah to reflect \n
On the ravages this mongstah contemplates. \n
He will break up all ouah homes, \n
And where'er the creatuah roams, \n
We'll be sundered from ouah lawful Tory mates. \n
We'll be tawn from ouah poah husbands in a most fe-rocious way, \n
0, deah ladies, can you realise ouah lot? \n
For the monstah has his eye \n
On the Sacred Marriage Tie; \n
And he'll eat up all the babes we haven't got. \n
And remembah, deahest ladies, all ouah comfort now depends \n
On destroying this wild Socialistic beast. \n
Ouah sassiety diversions \n
Would be vulgah mob excursions \n
If we pandered to the monstah in the least. \n
He is bent on confiscating all the houses, land and wealth \n
Of ouah husbands, and ouah brothahs, and ouah friends. \n
He is jealous of his bettahs. \n
And he calls ouah men-folk sweatahs, \n
He'll do anything to gain his awful ends. \n
He's vulgah and unchivalrous this feahful Labah thing. \n
He is teaching all ouah servants to despise us. \n
He would drag us to his level, \n
And he'd send to the - ah - devil \n
All the luxuries with which his toil supplies us. \n
He harps upon equality when, as of course you know, \n
And as all the very naicest people know, \n
It would simply mean disaster \n
To imagine ev'ry master \n
Quaite as ignorant as workers or as 'low.' \n
0, smaite the Socialistic monstah! Smaite him hard, mai deahs! \n
0, gathah up youah skirts and join the fray. \n
Pray, do not shirk the battle, or, with wailing and with teahs, \n
You'll regret youah negligence on polling day, \n
We must teach the vulgah working class their raight position here; \n
We must keep them in their places; we must faight them without fear, \n
Or there'll be a bittah wail, mai deahs, \n
If Socialists prevail, mai deahs, \n
And all 'raight thinking' people and the 'naicest' disappear. \n<|endoftext|>

Upon a journey, so sure Golden; \n
Off our guard-ambushed \n

I commend myself and my love to you, \n
Aurelius. I ask for modest indulgence, \n
so, if you’ve ever had a desire in your mind \n
you’ve pursued chastely and purely, \n
keep this boy of mine modestly safe, \n
I don’t speak to the masses – nothing to fear \n
from those who pass to and fro in the streets \n
occupied with their business – \n
truly the fear’s of you and your cock \n
dangerous to both good and bad boys. \n
Shake it about as you please, and with as much \n
force as you please, wherever you choose, outside: \n
I except him from that, with modesty, I think. \n
But if tempests of mind, and mad passion \n
impel you to too much sin, you wretch, \n
so you fill my boy’s head with deceptions, \n
then let misery, and evil fate, be yours! \n
Of him whom, with feet dragged apart, an open door, \n
radishes and mullets pass through. \n<|endoftext|>

Ms. Leech doesn't like me \n

I rocked you, swaddled you, sang to you, \n

We played and learned together. \n
I held your little hands from your first steps \n
To the back of the bicycle seat on your first ride \n
Doctored up scraped knees and bruised egos \n
Played the Tooth fairy, Easter Bunny and Santa Claus \n
When life took you through a challenge \n
I held you in my arms as you cried \n
We wiped the tears and stood up tall \n
Ready to face the world again \n
Late one night when I was awakened by the sounds \n
Of giggles coming from the adjacent room \n
I could've be upset that you had woken me \n
But the sound of your laughter made me smile \n
You were so late coming home one night \n
I cried at the thought of something happening to you \n
I was so angry that you hadn’t called \n
But upon seeing your beautiful face, all I could be was grateful \n
Now you’re ready to spread your wings \n
All of our trials and tribulations are ancient history \n
Go now my love into the world \n
Make your mark and shine your light \n
You have been the source of my greatest joy \n
From your baby coos to your big girl shoes \n
Always remember who you are \n
You have always been my brightest star \n<|endoftext|>

The old school gate still stands here though \n
The school has long since gone, \n
It stands amongst the hedgerow now \n
And opens for no one, \n
The school gate leads to nowhere \n
No one passes through it now, \n
And it remains so firmly shut \n
Yet it survived somehow. \n
Although its frame is rusting well \n
And crumbling away, \n
It stands there as a symbol of \n
A long forgotten day, \n
A small estate of houses where \n
The classrooms used to be, \n
The playground too has vanished now \n
It breaks my heart to see. \n
So many times I'd waited here \n
So many times passed through, \n
I close my eyes and can recall \n
The times that I once knew, \n
The parting and the welcoming \n
I held my mother's hand, \n
Beside this gate in front of me \n
That can now barely stand. \n
So sad to see it in this state \n
So many years gone by, \n
Yet while it lasts my dreams survive \n
And memories will not die, \n
The faces of the teachers \n
And the faces of my friends, \n
The sight of children playing there \n
Yet here is where it ends. \n<|endoftext|>

I found an old country Cowboy Valentine \n

It was signed at the bottom in crayon \n

You could tell it was all hand made \n
some of the glitter and bangles have fallen off. \n
Colored with bright colors so neatly \n
Better than any in a store, one could have bought. \n
Tried to picture the face that made it \n
tried as hard as I could ever do. \n
But for as hard as I had tried to remember \n
I couldn't grasp that vision of you. \n
Those were the days of less worries \n
and a childs heart now just memories. \n

In that Valentines card you made for me. \n<|endoftext|>

Zero education \n

He is a school dropout \n

I walk through life, \n
Day-by-day. \n
Full of never-ending strife, \n
Void of my say. \n
The butt of every joke, \n
In every way. \n
They always poke, \n
Are you gay? \n
I’m sick of the pranks. \n
Sometimes I just want, \n
To attack them with shanks. \n
For each little taunt. \n
I dare not try nor tell, \n
They would just run and squeal. \n
Worsening this living hell, \n
Of no appeal. \n
Only I would be at fault. \n
They are like a toon, \n
Never coming to a halt. \n
I wish it would end soon. \n
Stupid is a good word, \n
Childish too. \n
To describe this absurd, \n
torture I go through. \n
They act like jerks, \n
Yet they have girlfriends. \n
They enjoy the perks, \n
And don’t care of the ends. \n
I’m civil and nice, \n
But always alone. \n
Free of any vice, \n
Yet I’m on my own. \n
If you can’t be good, \n

Maybe someday you could, \n
From my side, see. \n<|endoftext|>

'Old order changeth yielding \n

To my dear IX Std. do something better, \n
Better than what we had. \n
To sing of you my friends and teachers, \n
Of the relationship we share, \n
Words will merely describe them, \n
Thoughts of love and care. \n
To you my teachers I express thanks, \n
Your teachings were not mere words. \n
They beautified and strengthened me \n
And helped me lead these sheep in herds. \n
And to you my friends, my dearest friends, \n
I wanna say nothing. \n
It’s only by words of love and silence, \n
That I speak to you and you to me. \n
And I must thank all my peons \n
Who worked behind the scene. \n
They swept my class and dirtied themselves, \n
And yet remained unseen. \n
We are leaving you my teachers \n
And you will go on teaching, \n
And when you’ll not be there, \n
Through us your lives will go on existing. \n
By and by this life will go on \n
And I’ll cherish these moments shared with you. \n
But I don’t want these moments at all, \n
For in my life, friends! I want you. \n
Many new flowers will bloom in life \n
And many more stars will shine. \n
But without you my dearest ones \n
It’ll be hard to make those stars and flowers all mine. \n
To live to the expectations of you, my teachers, \n
And friends your wishes, I’ll try. \n
Though amidst the chaos of my life \n
In silence my heart will cry. \n
Thank you my teachers and good luck my friends \n

An old man, gathering youthful memories and blooms, that youth itself \n

And these I see--these sparkling eyes, \n
These stores of mystic meaning--these young lives, \n
Building, equipping, like a fleet of ships--immortal ships! \n
Soon to sail out over the measureless seas, \n
On the Soul's voyage. \n
Only a lot of boys and girls? 10 \n
Only the tiresome spelling, writing, ciphering classes? \n

school \n
'And has the Sun his flaming chariot driven \n
Two hundred times around the ring of heaven, \n
Since Science first, with all her sacred train, \n
Beneath yon roof began her heavenly reign? \n
While thus I mused, methought, before mine eyes, \n
The Power of EDUCATION seemed to rise; \n
Not she whose rigid precepts trained the boy \n
Dead to the sense of every finer joy; \n
Nor that vile wretch who bade the tender age \n
Spurn Reason's law and humour Passion's rage; \n
But she who trains the generous British youth \n
In the bright paths of fair majestic Truth: \n
Emerging slow from Academus' grove \n
In heavenly majesty she seemed to move. \n
Stern was her forehead, but a smile serene \n
'Softened the terrors of her awful mien.' \n
Close at her side were all the powers, designed \n
To curb, exalt, reform the tender mind: \n
With panting breast, now pale as winter snows, \n
Now flushed as Hebe, Emulation rose; \n
Shame followed after with reverted eye, \n
And hue far deeper than the Tyrian dye; \n
Last Industry appeared with steady pace, \n
A smile sat beaming on her pensive face. \n
I gazed upon the visionary train, \n
Threw back my eyes, returned, and gazed again. \n
When lo! the heavenly goddess thus began, \n
Through all my frame the pleasing accents ran. \n
''When Superstition left the golden light \n
And fled indignant to the shades of night; \n
When pure Religion reared the peaceful breast \n
And lulled the warring passions into rest, \n
Drove far away the savage thoughts that roll \n
In the dark mansions of the bigot's soul, \n
Enlivening Hope displayed her cheerful ray, \n
And beamed on Britain's sons a brighter day; \n
So when on Ocean's face the storm subsides, \n
Hushed are the winds and silent are the tides; \n
The God of day, in all the pomp of light, \n
Moves through the vault of heaven, and dissipates the \n
night; \n
Wide o'er the main a trembling lustre plays, \n
The glittering waves reflect the dazzling blaze \n
Science with joy saw Superstition fly \n
Before the lustre of Religion's eye; \n
With rapture she beheld Britannia smile, \n
Clapped her strong wings, and sought the cheerful isle, \n
The shades of night no more the soul involve, \n
She sheds her beam, and, lo! the shades dissolve; \n
No jarring monks, to gloomy cell confined, \n
With mazy rules perplex the weary mind; \n
No shadowy forms entice the soul aside, \n
Secure she walks, Philosophy her guide. \n
Britain, who long her warriors had adored, \n
And deemed all merit centred in the sword; \n
Britain, who thought to stain the field was fame, \n
Now honoured Edward's less than Bacon's name. \n
Her sons no more in listed fields advance \n
To ride the ring, or toss the beamy lance; \n
No longer steel their indurated hearts \n
To the mild influence of the finer arts; \n
Quick to the secret grotto they retire \n
To court majestic truth, or wake the golden lyre; \n
By generous Emulation taught to rise, \n
The seats of learning brave the distant skies. \n
Then noble Sandys, inspired with great design, \n
Reared Hawkshead's happy roof, and called it mine. \n
There have I loved to show the tender age \n
The golden precepts of the classic page; \n
To lead the mind to those Elysian plains \n
Where, throned in gold, immortal Science reigns; \n
Fair to the view is sacred Truth displayed, \n
In all the majesty of light arrayed, \n
To teach, on rapid wings, the curious soul \n
To roam from heaven to heaven, from pole to pole, \n
From thence to search the mystic cause of things \n
And follow Nature to her secret springs; \n
Nor less to guide the fluctuating youth \n
Firm in the sacred paths of moral truth, \n
To regulate the mind's disordered frame, \n
And quench the passions kindling into flame; \n
The glimmering fires of Virtue to enlarge, \n
And purge from Vice's dross my tender charge. \n
Oft have I said, the paths of Fame pursue, \n
And all that Virtue dictates, dare to do; \n
Go to the world, peruse the book of man, \n
And learn from thence thy own defects to scan; \n
Severely honest, break no plighted trust, \n
But coldly rest not here- be more than just; \n
Join to the rigours of the sires of Rome \n
The gentler manners of the private dome; \n
When Virtue weeps in agony of woe, \n
Teach from the heart the tender tear to flow; \n
If Pleasure's soothing song thy soul entice, \n
Or all the gaudy pomp of splendid Vice, \n
Arise superior to the Siren's power, \n
The wretch, the short-lived vision of an hour; \n
Soon fades her cheek, her blushing beauties fly, \n
As fades the chequered bow that paints the sky, \n
So shall thy sire, whilst hope his breast inspires, \n
And wakes anew life's glimmering trembling fires, 0 \n
Hear Britain's sons rehearse thy praise with joy, \n
Look up to heaven, and bless his darling boy. \n
If e'er these precepts quelled the passions' strife, \n
If e'er they smoothed the rugged walks of life, \n
If e'er they pointed forth the blissful way \n
That guides the spirit to eternal day, \n
Do thou, if gratitude inspire thy breast, \n
Spurn the soft fetters of lethargic rest. \n
Awake, awake! and snatch the slumbering lyre, \n
Let this bright morn and Sandys the song inspire.' \n
'I looked obedience: the celestial Fair \n
Smiled like the morn, and vanished into air.' \n<|endoftext|>
school \n
We could not have counted on it, \n
those days when we were children young in years \n
but rich with a thousand hopes \n
jostling, pushed aside, forgotten in a day, \n
turned over in the mind in those few savoured moments \n
before a happy-tired sleep \n
nor did we think even to hope for it \n
or think how it would be to squeeze the honey of it \n
between our palms into our ready mouths \n
leaving the wax upon our hands and laughing \n
together or alone, in rainbow solitude \n
but now it’s here, we can savour the honey of it, \n
the future which we could not have had before \n
the days and years had closed like inexorable cupped petals, \n
into a summer evening’s sun-hazed past – \n
we could not have hoped or counted on nor dreamed - \n
these days when, all required work now done, \n
life’s evening hours and the late and lazy \n
golden leisure of fruit-filled autumn branches \n
stretches out in even though not endless measure – \n
today I choose to go to school to Rilke, \n
a choice as free as we think the birds are free, \n
the animals, the trees – yet know so little, \n
so very little, of their life – \n
and pick up the book of his poems at blissful random, \n
and read one single line – \n
‘I have great faith in all things not yet spoken’ – \n
and sit here, as the world falls, gently, as somewhere far away, \n
the book silent between my hands, having spoken, \n
like a honeycomb holding the honey \n
of some new, untrodden, unbelievably rich life. \n<|endoftext|>

If I were a galaxy in outer space \n
and wanted to find my reflection, \n
a mirror I'd seek so to peek at my face \n
while engaging in introspection. \n
Suppose I was millions of light-years away \n
in a constellation called Maiden \n
or Virgo, to use its correct sobriquet, \n
with a twin doppelgänger laden. \n
Might I query, ‘Oh mirror high in the sky, \n
midst linked arms and blueish trail flowing, \n
do you think my double is fairer than I? \n
What image is that you are showing? \n
‘Is it beauty you see gazing back at me, \n
mythopoeic in pondering mood? '— \n
Notwithstanding what seems to be harmony, \n
something's wrong with that calm attitude. \n
The peaceable aspect is masking a stage \n
of an astronomic collision \n
that began in an erstwhile earlier age \n
and will cause extensive revision. \n
In infrared, NGC five three three one \n
is a hundred billion times brighter, \n
it's said, than the luminousness of the Sun, \n
(hard to grasp for a starlit writer) . \n
A mirror speaks not, unless it is magic, \n
plus envisioning likenesses flipped. \n
What will that merger be, placid or tragic \n
in the redrafted galactic script? \n
The picture of two spirals interacting, \n
during a junction's coming to pass, \n
reveals the duo each other impacting, \n
thus to resemble a looking glass. \n
In the sequel by Carroll to Wonderland, \n
Alice climbs through to the other side \n
of the mirror, where she meets with peril and \n
Tweedledum and Tweedledee abide. \n
Yet our surroundings behave as reflector \n
much like the Moon with the tidal ebb. \n
Hence is futurity glimpsed as a specter \n
hither and thither weaving its web… \n
Humans cast shadows in all causal matters \n
touching on Nature's balance on Earth \n
fragilely wrought as a mirror that shatters. \n
Oh may we waken to life's true worth! \n<|endoftext|>

A mirror hung upon a wall. \n
A man, quite handsome, also tall \n
stepped up to look inside the glass \n
and gave himself the nod, the pass. \n
He saw exquisite, handsome features \n
superior to all other creatures. \n
Black hair and pearl white teeth to smile \n
Amana suit completes the style. \n
His nails were short and manicured \n
flat stomach muscles had endured \n
so many sessions of the crunches \n
and, from inside, Martini lunches. \n
Two diamonds hung from his sleeves \n
and maple golden rings, like leaves \n
adorned pink ears and looked expensive \n
his jewellery was quite extensive \n
and in addition, on his arms \n
two Rolexes, with loud alarms. \n
He stood and looked from head to toes \n
but did not know a mirror shows \n
to all the world just your outside \n
what counts is all the things you hide. \n

mirror \n
The rich house had in the hall \n
An enormous mirror, very old; \n
Bought at least eighty years ago. \n
A very handsome boy, assistant at a tailor’s \n
(On Sundays an amateur athlete), \n
Was standing there with a parcel. He handed it \n
To someone of the house, and he took it inside \n
To fetch the receipt. The tailor’s assistant \n
Was left alone, and waited. \n
He went up to the mirror and began to look at himself \n
And put his tie straight. After five minutes \n
They brought him the receipt. He took it and went away. \n
But the old mirror which had seen, and seen, \n
In the many years it had been \n
In existence, thousands of things and faces; \n
The old mirror was glad now \n
And was proud to have received upon itself \n
That entire beauty for a few minutes. \n<|endoftext|>

Do you wish to know what is your 'soul', \n
in all its glory, and its whole estate? \n
To know if it knows but a part, or All? \n
Its birth; its growth, its life - or lives; its fate? \n
Is it the watcher, even of itself? \n
Is it its own revealer, beyond words? \n
Can wise men tell us its true health and wealth? \n
If not, can we be sure that it exists? \n
For lack of witness to the soul's true bounds, \n
then, witness all the wonders of the world \n
of nature, beauty, law: then, what responds \n
in our self's mirror, is soul's map unfurled: \n
unbounded witness to its Maker; masked, \n
until for glorious proof of this it's asked! \n<|endoftext|>

Of a white winged unicorn \n
Suddenly the thought of morphing \n
Frightened her a bit \n
As she thought of the impossibility \n
Of being in the ballet \n
Or riding on an airplane to visit her aunt \n

Canceling her wish to be a unicorn \n

mother \n
In Roman times, when swords were raised, \n
And peace on Earth was rare, \n
There lived a girl now highly praised, \n
A girl beyond compare... \n
Her name was Mary, Joseph's love, \n
Betrothed, untouched by Man... \n
Who met an angel from above \n
Who then revealed God's plan! \n
'Young maiden, you are full of grace! \n
The Lord chose you of all! \n
You shall conceive and then embrace \n
The child that God must call! \n
He shall be king and rightly so, \n
Begotten of the Lord! \n
And blessed is he, God's Son to know... \n
So, Mary, be assured! ' \n
God's Son was born as prophesied! \n
To Mary, here on Earth... \n
In time, she saw Him crucified! \n
Esteemed not for His worth! \n
Her heart was broken just like His! \n
She held his mortal frame! \n
And neath her tears, a final kiss \n
As she whispered His name... \n
Her heart was numbed just like her soul... \n
With trembling hands she prayed... \n
Although she knew God kept control, \n
Her spirit was dismayed! \n
With trembling lips she sought His peace, \n

Forgiveness, born of faith! ' \n

The answer to do you love me isn't, I married you, didn't I? \n
Or, Can't we discuss this after the ballgame is through? \n
It isn't, Well that all depends on what you mean by 'love'. \n
Or even, Come to bed and I'll prove that I do. \n
The answer isn't, How can I talk about love when \n
the bacon is burned and the house is an absolute mess and \n
the children are screaming their heads off and \n
I'm going to miss my bus? \n
The answer is yes. \n

And last, in wedded bliss \n
How others claim with joy to-day \n
The lips you used to kiss. \n
Your children distant will become, \n
And wide the gulf will grow; \n
The lips of loving will be dumb, \n
The trust you used to know \n
Will in another's heart repose, \n
Another's voice will cheer... \n
And you will fondle baby clothes \n
And brush away a tear. \n
But though you are estranged almost, \n
And often lost to view, \n
How you will see a little ghost \n
Who ran to cling to you! \n

Caress you with a smile... \n

As my thoughts wander \n

On a low stool \n
With swollen feet and a heavy body \n
With waves of nausea and anxiety \n
Drowning me in the abyss of depression \n
Wondering if I was in for a second nightmare \n
Much more frightening than the last…. \n
My daughter would complete one decade of her life next month… \n

On a low stool \n
With needles and threads of different colors \n

Wondering if He was going to make my daughter \n

You flaunt yourself \n
Among the besmirched. \n
The poorest of your sons \n
Lies struck down. \n
When his hunger was great. \n
Your other sons \n
Raised their hands against him. \n
This is notorious. \n
With their hands thus raised, \n
Raised against their brother, \n
They march insolently around you \n
And laugh in your face. \n
This is well known. \n
In your house \n
Lies are roared aloud. \n
But the truth \n
Must be silent. \n
Is it so? \n
Why do the oppressors praise you everywhere, \n
The oppressed accuse you? \n
The plundered \n
Point to you with their fingers, but \n
The plunderer praises the system \n
That was invented in your house! \n
Whereupon everyone sees you \n
Hiding the hem of your mantle which is bloody \n
With the blood \n
Of your best sons. \n
Hearing the harangues which echo from your house, \n
men laugh. \n
But whoever sees you reaches for a knife \n
As at the approach of a robber. \n

Let her have laughter with her little one; \n
Teach her the endless, tuneless songs to sing, \n
Grant her her right to whisper to her son \n
The foolish names one dare not call a king. \n
Keep from her dreams the rumble of a crowd, \n
The smell of rough-cut wood, the trail of red, \n
The thick and chilly whiteness of the shroud \n
That wraps the strange new body of the dead. \n
Ah, let her go, kind Lord, where mothers go \n
And boast his pretty words and ways, and plan \n
The proud and happy years that they shall know \n
Together, when her son is grown a man. \n<|endoftext|>

From the third to the fourth. \n
Until she had jumped onto the roof. \n
There, having choked with air, clinging to the chimney, \n
she looked down from where she could hear \n
the crackle of flames which were reaching higher and higher. \n
And then she became motionless and silent. \n
She kept silent to the end, till the moment \n
at which she suddenly clenched her eyelids, \n
stepped to the roof edge and, throwing forward her arms, \n
she dropped her baby down. \n
Two seconds earlier than she herself leapt down. \n<|endoftext|>

God made my mother on an April day, \n
From sorrow and the mist along the sea, \n
Lost birds' and wanderers' songs and ocean spray, \n
And the moon loved her wandering jealously. \n
Beside the ocean's din she combed her hair, \n
Singing the nocturne of the passing ships, \n
Before her earthly lover found her there \n
And kissed away the music from her lips. \n
She came unto the hills and saw the change \n
That brings the swallow and the geese in turns. \n
But there was not a grief she deeméd strange, \n
For there is that in her which always mourns. \n
Kind heart she has for all on hill or wave \n
Whose hopes grew wings like ants to fly away. \n
I bless the God Who such a mother gave \n
This poor bird-hearted singer of a day. \n<|endoftext|>

Here I lean over you, small son, sleeping \n
Warm in my arms, \n
And I con to my heart all your dew-fresh charms, \n
As you lie close, close in my hungry hold... \n
Your hair like a miser's dream of gold, \n
And the white rose of your face far fairer, \n
Finer, and rarer \n
Than all the flowers in the young year's keeping; \n
Over lips half parted your low breath creeping \n
Is sweeter than violets in April grasses; \n
Though your eyes are fast shut I can see their blue, \n
Splendid and soft as starshine in heaven, \n
With all the joyance and wisdom given \n
From the many souls who have stanchly striven \n
Through the dead years to be strong and true. \n
Those fine little feet in my worn hands holden... \n
Where will they tread? \n
Valleys of shadow or heights dawn-red? \n
And those silken fingers, O, wee, white son, \n
What valorous deeds shall by them be done \n
In the future that yet so distant is seeming \n
To my fond dreaming? \n
What words all so musical and golden \n
With starry truth and poesy olden \n
Shall those lips speak in the years on-coming? \n
O, child of mine, with waxen brow, \n
Surely your words of that dim to-morrow \n
Rapture and power and grace must borrow \n
From the poignant love and holy sorrow \n
Of the heart that shrines and cradles you now! \n
Some bitter day you will love another, \n
To her will bear \n
Love-gifts and woo her... then must I share \n
You and your tenderness! Now you are mine \n
From your feet to your hair so golden and fine, \n
And your crumpled finger-tips... mine completely, \n
Wholly and sweetly; \n
Mine with kisses deep to smother, \n
No one so near to you now as your mother! \n
Others may hear your words of beauty, \n
But your precious silence is mine alone; \n
Here in my arms I have enrolled you, \n
Away from the grasping world I fold you, \n
Flesh of my flesh and bone of my bone! \n<|endoftext|>

~ Mother Dear, O Mother Dear \n
Mother dear, oh Mother dear, were you ever young? \n
How felt you on the day when love had just begun? \n
Did tulips drip from every branch and joy obscure the sun? \n
Did secret smiles once mold your hopes \n
Where lines of care and dread are ropes \n
That tell of bitter loss instead, \n
The smiles forgotten now and fled? \n
Like me, were you once mesmerized \n
Of blissfilled future, sunny skies, \n
Then saw the storm clouds gather round, \n
Felt the darkness, heard the sound \n
Of lighting charring all your dreams, \n
Each betrayal worse than last it seems? \n
Through heavy days and heavy thoughts, \n
Each step mechanically has brought \n
You to this day where now you live, \n
Those dreams forgotten, for it is \n
That dreams are fairy-castles built \n
And meant to evaporate and wilt. \n
Then, as you held each fragile child, \n
Did ghosts of dreams bring back a smile? \n
Forgotten dreams, once more reborn, \n
To die again before the dawn- \n
Unmourned, unnoticed, as time moved on, \n
Interred within your heart's sad song? \n
Mother dear, oh Mother dear, were we ever young? \n<|endoftext|>

She rides atop her nightmare down through life's eternal passage, to where? \n
No one way and yet all lead the same \n
none can hide \n
We fall and another will take our place free to decay \n
We are, we have, we live, we weep- all is to be gained, all are at loss, \n

Theirs times I even wish I didn’t know you. \n
But what would I be without you? \n
Would I be different or would I be the same? \n
Have you changed my life? \n
Or did I change it on my own? \n
Was I different before? \n
How come you want nothing to do with me? \n
You leave me in the dust whenever you have the chance. \n
Doesn’t seem like you care. \n
If you do care you have a funny way of showing it. \n
We use to be like best friends. \n
I grew up and you kicked me off to the side. \n
Or did I kick you off? \n
So many questions. \n
Not enough answers. \n
Not enough time to even ask all the questions. \n
My mind feels like it’s going to explode. \n
Not enough time in the day to even express my feelings. \n
Not enough time to share my thoughts. \n
It never seems to be the right time. \n
When is the right time? \n
Is it today or tomorrow? \n
When will you be there again for me? \n
You went away so quick I didn’t have a chance to say goodbye. \n
I guess drinking really got a hold of you. \n
Some have the will power and others don’t know how to say no. \n
How could you let drinking get to you? \n
When you have three kids. \n
Now two don’t even live with you. \n
Granted one of them is married. \n
But the other is still a young child. \n
Looks at you with disgrace. \n
You don’t even seem to notice. \n
While your family is breaking apart you just care about your glass filling up. \n
How do you live like that? \n
I know you’re not happy, so what’s bothering you? \n
You’ve been through a lot granted. \n
BUT SO HAVE I! ! \n
Look what you’re doing to me. \n
What you think it doesn’t bother me? \n
It does but I guess that’s what blindness will do to you. \n
When will you notice me? \n
IM RIGHT HERE! ! \n
Pick up the phone and call me sometimes. \n
Why do I always have to be the bigger person? \n
I’m supposed to be the kid. \n
When was I able to be a kid? \n
When will it be my time? \n
I’m always there for everyone else. \n
How come you can’t be there for me? \n
Your always trying to mess up what I accomplish. \n
Putting negative thoughts into my head constantly. \n
Do you want to see me fail? \n
Well I'm going to tell you right now IM NOT GOING TO FAIL! ! \n
How come you hate me so much? \n
What did I do to you? \n
I was always the one that listened to how bad your day was? \n
I was the one who listened all the time \n
Who else was their for you? \n
Dad was always at work. \n
Sam was never home. \n
I was I was their. \n
But you don’t think about that now do you. \n
Since I left you don’t seem to need me anymore. \n
Now you have toked my friend to live with you. \n
But threaten her she will have to leave when she make’s a mistake. \n
How true are you? \n
You shad your tears about how much you miss me. \n
But do you really miss me? \n
Telling people lies after lies. \n
Why do you do what you do? \n
How come you act like that? \n
Can’t you go back to being yourself? \n
You’ve changed and I don’t like it. \n
To be honest not a lot of people like it. \n
But I guess whatever you want to do you will do. \n
But this is my time now. \n
Now you know how I feel. \n
So don’t ask me again. \n<|endoftext|>

CHICAGO sounds rough to the maker of verse; \n
One comfort we have--Cincinnati sounds worse; \n
If we only were licensed to say Chicago! \n
But Worcester and Webster won't let us, you know. \n
No matter, we songsters must sing as we can; \n
We can make some nice couplets with Lake Michigan, \n
And what more resembles a nightingale's voice, \n
Than the oily trisyllable, sweet Illinois? \n
Your waters are fresh, while our harbor is salt, \n
But we know you can't help it--it is n't your fault; \n
Our city is old and your city is new, \n
But the railroad men tell us we're greener than you. \n
You have seen our gilt dome, and no doubt you've been told \n
That the orbs of the universe round it are rolled; \n
But I'll own it to you, and I ought to know best, \n
That this is n't quite true of all stars of the West. \n
You'll go to Mount Auburn,--we'll show you the track,-- \n
And can stay there,--unless you prefer to come back; \n
And Bunker's tall shaft you can climb if you will, \n
But you'll puff like a paragraph praising a pill. \n
You must see--but you have seen--our old Faneuil Hall, \n
Our churches, our school-rooms, our sample-rooms, all; \n
And, perhaps, though the idiots must have their jokes, \n
You have found our good people much like other folks. \n
There are cities by rivers, by lakes, and by seas, \n
Each as full of itself as a cheese-mite of cheese; \n
And a city will brag as a game-cock will crow \n
Don't your cockerels at home--just a little, you know? \n
But we'll crow for you now--here's a health to the boys, \n
Men, maidens, and matrons of fair Illinois, \n
And the rainbow of friendship that arches its span \n
From the green of the sea to the blue Michigan! \n<|endoftext|>

Snow wraps around you, and the air sings to you. \n
The trees are bare, however my southern soul longs to be there. \n
A visit is fine with me. \n

Power is your song for people to be reborn. \n

The Chicago World's Fair was near \n
Ending as a great success bright. \n
Mayor Carter Harrison prepared \n
A closing speech, wise and witty. \n
Thanks to the speeches he had aired, \n

No more would the Mayor speechify. \n

funeral \n
The coffin as I past across the lane \n
Came sudden on my view. It was not here, \n
A sight of every day, as in the streets \n
Of the great city, and we paus'd and ask'd \n
Who to the grave was going. It was one, \n
A village girl, they told us, who had borne \n
An eighteen months strange illness, and had pined \n
With such slow wasting that the hour of death \n
Came welcome to her. We pursued our way \n
To the house of mirth, and with that idle talk \n
That passes o'er the mind and is forgot, \n
We wore away the time. But it was eve \n
When homewardly I went, and in the air \n
Was that cool freshness, that discolouring shade \n
That makes the eye turn inward. Then I heard \n
Over the vale the heavy toll of death \n
Sound slow; it made me think upon the dead, \n
I questioned more and learnt her sorrowful tale. \n
She bore unhusbanded a mother's name, \n
And he who should have cherished her, far off \n
Sail'd on the seas, self-exil'd from his home, \n
For he was poor. Left thus, a wretched one, \n
Scorn made a mock of her, and evil tongues \n
Were busy with her name. She had one ill \n
Heavier, neglect, forgetfulness from him \n
Whom she had loved so dearly. Once he wrote, \n
But only once that drop of comfort came \n
To mingle with her cup of wretchedness; \n
And when his parents had some tidings from him, \n
There was no mention of poor Hannah there, \n
Or 'twas the cold enquiry, bitterer \n
Than silence. So she pined and pined away \n
And for herself and baby toil'd and toil'd, \n
Nor did she, even on her death bed, rest \n
From labour, knitting with her outstretch'd arms \n
Till she sunk with very weakness. Her old mother \n
Omitted no kind office, and she work'd \n
Hard, and with hardest working barely earn'd \n
Enough to make life struggle and prolong \n
The pains of grief and sickness. Thus she lay \n
On the sick bed of poverty, so worn \n
With her long suffering and that painful thought \n
That at her heart lay rankling, and so weak, \n
That she could make no effort to express \n
Affection for her infant; and the child, \n
Whose lisping love perhaps had solaced her \n
With a strange infantine ingratitude \n
Shunn'd her as one indifferent. She was past \n
That anguish, for she felt her hour draw on, \n
And 'twas her only comfoft now to think \n
Upon the grave. 'Poor girl!' her mother said, \n
'Thou hast suffered much!' 'aye mother! there is none \n
'Can tell what I have suffered!' she replied, \n
'But I shall soon be where the weary rest.' \n
And she did rest her soon, for it pleased God \n
To take her to his mercy. \n<|endoftext|>

I often tell my beloved, \n
Please adorn me with beautiful, \n
Jasmine flowers. \n
Like a lovely bride, I should look. \n
Once, I had long shining silky hair, \n
And I loved to wear jasmine flowers, \n
But I cut my hair short. \n
But don't be stingy \n
Tuck jasmine flowers only, in my hair. \n
Cover me with kanjeepuram sari only, \n
Else I will question you. \n
As I love to look today, \n
Like a beautiful bride. \n
Cover me with full of fragrance, \n
As I love perfumes, \n
My eyes to be beautifully drawn with, \n
Eye Liner. \n
Of course, be careful as it may hurt me too. \n
No lipstick as I don't like. \n
Yeah but scented talcum powder would be fine for me. \n
And one big bindi on my forehead. \n
And a small sandal wood paste on top of it. \n
I should look like a beautiful bride. \n
Ain't I? \n
Don't wake up the bride. \n
She is in her deep sleep.... \n
Let her sleep! \n
Note..In this poem, I portrayed a scene of a woman whose husband fulfils her last death wishes. Like a bride she was decorated and taken for funeral. Thats why I said last lines...let her sleep... \n

funeral \n
The day that YOUTH had died, \n
There came to his grave-side, \n
In decent mourning, from the country's ends, \n
Those scatter'd friends \n
Who had lived the boon companions of his prime, \n
And laughed with him and sung with him and wasted, \n
In feast and wine and many-crown'd carouse, \n
The days and nights and dawnings of the time \n
When YOUTH kept open house, \n
Nor left untasted \n
Aught of his high emprise and ventures dear, \n
No quest of his unshar'd -- \n
All these, with loitering feet and sad head bar'd, \n
Followed their old friend's bier. \n
FOLLY went first, \n
With muffled bells and coxcomb still revers'd; \n
And after trod the bearers, hat in hand -- \n
LAUGHTER, most hoarse, and Captain PRIDE with tanned \n
And martial face all grim, and fussy JOY, \n
Who had to catch a train, and LUST, poor, snivelling boy; \n
These bore the dear departed. \n
Behind them, broken-hearted, \n
Came GRIEF, so noisy a widow, that all said, \n
"Had he but wed \n
Her elder sister SORROW, in her stead!" \n
And by her, trying to soothe her all the time, \n
The fatherless children, COLOUR, TUNE, and RHYME \n
(The sweet lad RHYME), ran all-uncomprehending. \n
Then, at the way's sad ending, \n
Round the raw grave they stay'd. Old WISDOM read, \n
In mumbling tone, the Service for the Dead. \n
There stood ROMANCE, \n
The furrowing tears had mark'd her rouged cheek; \n
Poor old CONCEIT, his wonder unassuaged; \n
Dead INNOCENCY's daughter, IGNORANCE; \n
And shabby, ill-dress'd GENEROSITY; \n
And ARGUMENT, too full of woe to speak; \n
PASSION, grown portly, something middle-aged; \n
And FRIENDSHIP -- not a minute older, she; \n
IMPATIENCE, ever taking out his watch; \n
FAITH, who was deaf, and had to lean, to catch \n
Old WISDOM's endless drone. \n
BEAUTY was there, \n
Pale in her black; dry-eyed; she stood alone. \n
Poor maz'd IMAGINATION; FANCY wild; \n
ARDOUR, the sunlight on his greying hair; \n
CONTENTMENT, who had known YOUTH as a child \n
And never seen him since. And SPRING came too, \n
Dancing over the tombs, and brought him flowers -- \n
She did not stay for long. \n
And TRUTH, and GRACE, and all the merry crew, \n
The laughing WINDS and RIVERS, and lithe HOURS; \n
And HOPE, the dewy-eyed; and sorrowing SONG; -- \n
Yes, with much woe and mourning general, \n
At dead YOUTH's funeral, \n
Even these were met once more together, all, \n
Who erst the fair and living YOUTH did know; \n
All, except only LOVE. LOVE had died long ago. \n<|endoftext|>

funeral \n
The death, end of the life journey \n
But not the end itself \n
The joining of self to the universe \n
The place of oblivion we can't explain. \n
The body after death, a corpse \n
To be cremated in such an honor \n
The self, soul and their activities \n
For which the body functioned hitherto. \n
A funeral pyre we makes \n
For its destruction on bodily matters \n
The final destiny it follows \n
Where it becomes flames and ashes. \n
Funeral in varied customs and beliefs \n
Changes of methods and things are one \n
The final journey must be in calm \n
without a return and repetition of the same. \n
Honor the death, the will of god \n
Your actions and life events are reckoned \n
And matters to the humans \n
Let the final journey come when it destines. \n
In a calm and perfect time like a ripe leaf. \n
funeral \n
'Twas in the year of 1888, and on the 19th of November, \n
Which the friends of the late Ex-Provost Rough will long remember, \n
Because 'twas on the 19th of November his soul took its flight \n
To the happy land above, the land of pure delight. \n
Take him for all in all, he was a very good man, \n
And during his Provostship he couldn't be equalled in Great Britain, \n
Which I proclaim to the world without any dread, \n
Because while Provost he reduced the public-houses to three hundred. \n
Whereas at the time there were 620 public-houses in the town, \n
But being a friend of the temperance cauae he did frown, \n
Because he saw the evils of intemperance every day \n
While sitting on the bench, so he resolved to sweep public-houses away. \n
And in doing so the good man, in my opinion, was right, \n
Because the evils of intemperance is an abomination in God's sight; \n
And all those that get drunk are enemies to Him, \n
Likewise enemies to Christ's kingdom, which is a great sin. \n
The late Ex-Provost Rough was President of the Dundee Temperance Society, \n
An office which he filled with great ability; \n
Besides Vice-President of the Scottish Temperance League for many years, \n
And no doubt the friends of temperance for his loss will shed tears. \n
Because many a hungry soul he relieved while in distress, \n
And for doing so I hope the Lord will him bless, \n
For his kindness towards the poor people in Dundee, \n
Besides for his love towards the temperance cause, and his integrity. \n
And when the good man's health began to decline \n
The doctor ordered him to take each day two glasses of wine, \n
But he soon saw the evil of it, and from it he shrunk, \n
The noble old patriarch, for fear of getting drunk. \n
And although the doctor advised him to continue taking the wine, \n
Still the hero of the temperance cause did decline, \n
And told the doctor he wouldn't of wine take any more, \n
So in a short time his spirit fled to heaven, where all troubles are o'er. \n
I'm sure very little good emanates from strong drink, \n
And many people, alas! it leads to hell's brink! \n
Some to the scaffold, and some to a pauper's grave, \n
Whereas if they would abstain from drink, Christ would them save. \n
'Twas on Friday afternoon, in November the 23rd day, \n
That the funeral cortege to the Western Cemetery wended its way, \n
Accompanied by the Magistrates, and amongst those present were- \n
Bailie Macdonald and Bailie Black, also Lord Provost Hunter I do declare. \n
There were also Bailie Foggie, Bailie Craig, and Bailie Stephenson, \n
And Ex-Provost Moncur, and Ex-Provost Ballingall representing the Royal Orphan Institution; \n
Besides there were present the Rev. J. Jenkins and the Rev. J. Masson, \n
With grief depicted in their faces and seemingly woe-begone. \n
There were also Mr Henry Adams, representing the Glover trade, \n
Also Mr J. Carter, who never was afraid \n
To denounce strong drink, and to warn the people from it to flee, \n
While agent of the Temperance Society in Dundee. \n
And when the funeral cortege arrived at the Western burying-ground, \n
Then the clergyman performed the funeral service with a solemn sound; \n
While from the eyes of the spectators fell many a tear \n
For the late Ex-Provost Rough they loved so dear. \n
And when the coffin was lowered into its house of clay, \n
Then the friends of the deceased homewards wended their way, \n
Conversing on the good qualities of the good man, \n
Declaring that the late Ex-Provost Rough couldn't be equalled in Great Britain. \n<|endoftext|>
funeral \n
Three years ago, I passed a little church \n
While I walked on my way \n
Sorrow rang out from the steeple bells \n
As in the cemetery a group of people gathered \n
I stopped to watch for a moment \n
A small coffin being carried to the graveside \n
Where soon it would be laid \n
The priest stood beside it and slowly said \n
“The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away \n
We commit this child into the arms of the Lord \n
For his safe keeping for ever and ever \n
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.” \n
At the graveside I could see in the scene \n
A young girl about nineteen and young man about twenty one \n
Both were heartbroken because it was their child \n
Their one any only son \n
Being laid to rest, but never to be forgotten \n
I turned to go on my way, when I saw from the grave \n
A stairway to the sky appear \n
On each step an angel stood all looking young and fair \n
I stood astonished for a while \n
As up the stairs walked a child \n
From that day to this I wonder all the time \n
What was the meaning of this sign \n
(Date written unknown) \n<|endoftext|>
funeral \n
By his side, whose days are past, \n
Lay bow and quiver! \n
And his eyes that stare aghast \n
Close, with a shiver. \n
God nor man from Death, at last, \n
Love may deliver. \n
Though, of old, we vowed, my dear, \n
Death should not take him; \n
Mourn not thou that we must here \n
Coldly forsake him; \n
Shed above his grave no tear, \n
Tears will not wake him. \n
Cupid lieth cold and dead, \n
Ended his flying, \n
Pale his lips, once rosy-red, \n
Swift was his dying. \n
Place a stone above his head, \n
Turn away, sighing. \n<|endoftext|>
funeral \n
You won't believe this, rightfully so, you'll think it’s not true \n
but a person will do anything, when he starts losing his screw \n
I didn't feel that any one loved me, so I devised one day \n
to test out my theory, in the most bizarre type of way \n
I found a way after considerable thought, to put myself on display \n
and to be able to stay inconspicuous, from a secure distance away \n
I watched them attend my eulogy, peculiar as it may sound \n
enjoying the reception, It was nothing short of spellbound \n
Who could think, a person as crazy as I might be \n
going to such extremes, who would ever foresee \n
to accomplish this great task, of convincing my heart \n
someone would somehow care, if I really did depart \n
In the back of the room, with shades covering my eyes \n
sinking into a chair, surrounded by this chorus of cries \n
who would ever suspect, that this stranger sitting in the back \n
was really not far away, from being deemed a quack \n
When my funeral was about over, I watched those flowers start to bend \n
they too seemed to be saying, haven't you yet been able to mend \n
so I pushed myself up front, in order to get a better look \n
this death looks too real, what if I really did pass over that final brook \n
As I approached my casket, overtaken by this powerful desire \n
could this really be happening, shaking with a cold perspire \n
to escape from this nightmare, there was but one thing to do \n
hastening to relieve myself, running from bed to bathroom, I flew \n
The lesson here to be learned, after thinking about it, was simple and clear \n
we often have these fears, and yet are not always aware \n
what’s important for us, is to truly recognize in ourselves, which is the key \n
understanding our need to feel loved, and the absurd lengths we go, in order to see \n<|endoftext|>

Through airy roads he wings his instant flight \n
To purer regions of celestial light; \n
Enlarg'd he sees unnumber'd systems roll, \n
Beneath him sees the universal whole, \n
Planets on planets run their destin'd round, \n
And circling wonders fill the vast profound. \n
Th' ethereal now, and now th' empyreal skies \n
With growing splendors strike his wond'ring eyes: \n
The angels view him with delight unknown, \n
Press his soft hand, and seat him on his throne; \n
Then smilling thus: 'To this divine abode, \n
'The seat of saints, of seraphs, and of God, \n
'Thrice welcome thou.' The raptur'd babe replies, \n
'Thanks to my God, who snatch'd me to the skies, \n

'E'er yet the tempter had beguil d my heart, \n

'E'er yet the lash for horrid crimes I felt, \n
'E'er vanity had led my way to guilt, \n
'But, soon arriv'd at my celestial goal, \n
'Full glories rush on my expanding soul.' \n
Joyful he spoke: exulting cherubs round \n
Clapt their glad wings, the heav'nly vaults resound. \n
Say, parents, why this unavailing moan? \n
Why heave your pensive bosoms with the groan? \n
To Charles, the happy subject of my song, \n
A brighter world, and nobler strains belong. \n

By thoughtless wishes, and prepost'rous love? \n
Doth his felicity increase your pain? \n
Or could you welcome to this world again \n

Thou too art dead, ---! very kind \n
Hast thou been to me in my childish days, \n
Thou best good creature. I have not forgot \n
How thou didst love thy Charles, when he was yet \n
A prating school-boy: I have not forgot \n
The busy joy on that important day, \n
When, child-like, the poor wanderer was content \n
To leave the bosom of parental love, \n
His childhood's play-place, and his early home, \n
For the rude fosterings of a stranger's hand, \n
Hard uncouth tasks, and school-boy's scanty fare. \n
How did thine eye peruse him round and round, \n
And hardly know him in his yellow coats[1], \n
Red leathern belt, and gown of russet blue! \n
Farewell, good aunt! \n
Go thou, and occupy the same grave-bed \n
Where the dead mother lies. \n
Oh my dear mother, oh thou dear dead saint! \n
Where's now that placid face, where oft hath sat \n
A mother's smile, to think her son should thrive \n
In this bad world, when she was dead and gone; \n
And where a tear hath sat (take shame, O son!) \n
When that same child has prov'd himself unkind. \n
One parent yet is left-a wretched thing, \n
A sad survivor of his buried wife, \n
A palsy-smitten, childish, old, old man, \n
A semblance most forlorn of what he was, \n
A merry cheerful man. A merrier man, \n
A man more apt to frame matter for mirth, \n
Mad jokes, and anticks for a Christmas eve; \n
Making life social, and the laggard time \n
To move on nimbly, never yet did cheer \n
The little circle of domestic friends. \n

funeral \n
The time has not come before \n
And this is new. \n
The light is opening for the day \n
An ingénue displaying her bosom \n
To man’s face- \n
I remember when \n
I was young in following her. \n
Her tassels feeling through the trees \n
And drinking roots, \n
She laughed even while \n
Alone; \n
Giggling, \n
She rode her bicycle across campus. \n
I staid up all night and prayed for her. \n
When tired, she slept \n
In the shade of a house- \n
Eyes half closed. I came to her, \n
She yawned and turned me away. \n
She said she loved me \n
Only when she was drunk, \n
And it was yet that time- \n
So long ago, yesterday.... \n
Then early this morning she came to me \n
And offered me the quaff \n
Of lips. \n
Dripping nectar on the limbs, \n
She said, “Never before now, old man, ” \n
As they lowered me in the grave, \n
Her light budded \n
A valleyide of rubrum, \n
A wedding at my funeral. \n<|endoftext|>
funeral \n
It's the one thing I can't rehearse \n
The final act where I have no lines \n
Or watch the audience in the isles \n
Complain of my performance in the role \n
And sneer derision that he looks so old \n
All powdered up and decked in mould \n
For one day they'll stand at their own curtains end \n
Being chewed by the flowers of their final applause \n
So long to the critics I can't hear you judge \n
Your despondent analysis of my really great lead \n
The only lead I ever had \n
In a role that I was born to play \n
In a role that I was born uncertain \n
Sitting there won't be so lonely \n
All cushioned up in velvet lining \n
Draped in mahogany chesterfield sachet \n
Escorted somewhere near the Hamptons \n
I'll be lead by strong men in maître d' form \n
Perhaps a young splendor will pass me a glance \n
While I'm indisposed to my own private table \n
Starring with thoughts that can't see conclusion \n
They'll be other occupants arranged in their seats \n
No one will see the others fatigue \n
Celebrating forever at our retire leisure \n
In a Funeral for one \n
And party that's just begun \n<|endoftext|>

Night funeral \n
In Harlem: \n
Where did they get \n
Them two fine cars? \n
Insurance man, he did not pay-- \n
His insurance lapsed the other day-- \n
Yet they got a satin box \n
for his head to lay. \n

Night funeral \n

Old preacher man \n
Preached that boy away-- \n
Charged Five Dollars \n

Night funeral \n
In Harlem: \n
When it was all over \n
And the lid shut on his head \n
and the organ had done played \n
and the last prayers been said \n
and six pallbearers \n
Carried him out for dead \n
And off down Lenox Avenue \n
That long black hearse done sped, \n
The street light \n
At his corner \n
Shined just like a tear-- \n
That boy that they was mournin' \n
Was so dear, so dear \n
To them folks that brought the flowers, \n
To that girl who paid the preacher man-- \n
It was all their tears that made \n
That poor boy's \n
Funeral grand. \n

funeral \n
What! and not one to heave the pious sigh! \n
Not one whose sorrow-swoln and aching eye \n
For social scenes, for life's endearments fled, \n
Shall drop a tear and dwell upon the dead! \n
Poor wretched Outcast! I will weep for thee, \n
And sorrow for forlorn humanity. \n
Yes I will weep, but not that thou art come \n
To the stern Sabbath of the silent tomb: \n
For squalid Want, and the black scorpion Care, \n
Heart-withering fiends! shall never enter there. \n
I sorrow for the ills thy life has known \n
As thro' the world's long pilgrimage, alone, \n
Haunted by Poverty and woe-begone, \n
Unloved, unfriended, thou didst journey on: \n
Thy youth in ignorance and labour past, \n
And thine old age all barrenness and blast! \n
Hard was thy Fate, which, while it doom'd to woe, \n
Denied thee wisdom to support the blow; \n
And robb'd of all its energy thy mind, \n
Ere yet it cast thee on thy fellow-kind, \n
Abject of thought, the victim of distress, \n
To wander in the world's wide wilderness. \n
Poor Outcast sleep in peace! the wintry storm \n
Blows bleak no more on thine unshelter'd form; \n
Thy woes are past; thou restest in the tomb;-- \n
I pause--and ponder on the days to come. \n<|endoftext|>

Where slaves have been sold and bought \n
With freedom won not merely by a simple handshake \n
I know it to be true; \n
That down below is an amazing picture \n
Of many a wonderful sea creature \n
That fishermen, endlessly try to capture \n
What about the water sports being featured? \n
Swimming, diving, boating, and waterskiing \n
All written excitingly in the oceans scripture \n
Still the ocean sometimes doesn’t know how to behave \n
When they come marching, those ginormous tidal waves! \n
All those present become a slave to its oceanic graves \n
And yet I know it to be true \n
If we shave all the water of the oceans carpet \n
Living will not be worth it on this planet! \n

The continent's a tamed ox, with all its mountains, \n
Powerful and servile; here is for plowland, here is \n

Cataract for power; it lies behind us at heel \n
All docile between this ocean and the other. If \n
flood troubles the lowlands, or earthquake \n
Cracks walls, it is only a slave's blunder or the \n
natural \n
Shudder of a new made slave. Therefore we happy \n
masters about the solstice \n
Light bonfires on the shore and celebrate our power. \n
The bay's necklaced with fire, the bombs make crystal \n
fountains in the air, the rockets \n
Shower swan's-neck over the night water.... I \n
imagined \n
The stars drew apart a little as if from troublesome \n
children, coldly compassionate; \n
But the ocean neither seemed astonished nor in awe: \n
If this had been the little sea that Xerxes whipped, \n
how it would have feared us. \n

Oh, Ocean! You mighty Ocean! \n
Why you've so much of passion, \n
For this globe, you hug, so tight, \n
To erode this land, left and right? \n
Who tailored you so well, \n
To suit your level as you swell, \n
As you keep this earth afloat, \n
For the sake of our comfort? \n
Mighty rivers into you flow, \n
Their surplus waters, row by row, \n
Still they quench not your thirst, \n
Nor take the heat off your breast. \n
You own a rich seabed, \n
Yet you've tears to shed, \n
That sink into the darkest clouds, \n
To fall back into thirsty rivers. \n
You maintain, in depth, silence, \n
Also make your shore full of noise, \n
With your endless roaring waves, \n
That ebb and tide, across. \n
All the sands the rivers dump, \n
Never let your level go up, \n
Nor all the heat, let by the sun, \n
Push your level down. \n
Your wavy fingers touch my feet, \n
To kindle my feelings, in retreat, \n
Little I guess o'er your submission, \n
Perhaps, an act of your veneration. \n
You are still growing in timeless age, \n
With full of treasures for pillage, \n
O'er the loss of riches, you never grieve, \n
But give this earth all you've. \n
Could this earth, ever green be, \n
Sans your mercy and glee, \n
While you swallow the heat of the sun, \n
To cool the breeze for every one. \n
You build this beach, sand by sand, \n
With your mile long wavy hand, \n
For us to sit and watch you do, \n
Restless in your coat of blue. \n
A silver coat, you borrow from the moon, \n
To thrill the hearts and minds of men, \n
To enchant a pair of love birds, \n
Deep into their merry dreamlands. \n
Your corridors obey Godmens' will, \n
To save their men from kill, \n
The brunt of wars, you silently bore, \n
Harboring all the frigates ashore. \n
Your crowning glory lies near the poles, \n
Where you play different roles, \n
Also far below unfathomable depth, \n
Where one is sure of facing death. \n
In your empire, is there any explosion, \n
In the size of fish population, \n
Also of other countless creatures, \n
That live in your roofless shelters? \n
You mind not our dirty pollution, \n
But give us your full protection, \n
Besides food, water and occupation, \n
In the cross country trade and communication. \n
Millions of years I may need, \n
Your books for me to read, \n
And cover all the pages, \n

Of enduring friendship \n
Throughout the seasons \n
With insects and birds, \n
Foliage and flowers, his co-creators \n

Nostalgic melodies \n

And faces unread. \n
A self-contained emotinal being. \n

Whispering through apertures \n
Of doors, of cores. \n
Spreading the magic of affection, \n
Erasing hatreds from \n
The slates of mind \n
And healing wounds \n
With his balmy libretto, \n
He consoles the heart. \n
Though a maverick in \n
The herds of social climbers, \n
His deep silence evokes \n
Wise thoughts. \n
A translucent rain \n
Wiping the mist of pain, \n
He grows \n
The creepers of camaraderie \n
In his poetry yards. \n
His ailing heart, \n
Varicose legs, \n
Olden heels \n
And clay bound feet, \n
All laborious episodes of \n
A lifetime drama serial. \n
Opening new ways \n
Between conscious and subconscious \n
My mentor, \n
Even with increasing age \n
Holds a bundle of dreams \n
For me, for all \n
Death's arrow is aiming at him - He knows \n

By camouflaging himself in words \n
beautiful and strong. \n

death \n
Don't fear death in earthly travels. \n
Don't fear enemies or friends. \n
Just listen to the words of prayers, \n
To pass the facets of the dreads. \n
Your death will come to you, and never \n
You shall be, else, a slave of life, \n
Just waiting for a dawn's favor, \n
From nights of poverty and strife. \n
She'll build with you a common law, \n
One will of the Eternal Reign. \n
And you are not condemned to slow \n
And everlasting deadly pain. \n<|endoftext|>
death \n
There are cemeteries that are lonely, \n
graves full of bones that do not make a sound, \n
the heart moving through a tunnel, \n
in it darkness, darkness, darkness, \n
like a shipwreck we die going into ourselves, \n
as though we were drowning inside our hearts, \n
as though we lived falling out of the skin into the soul. \n
And there are corpses, \n
feet made of cold and sticky clay, \n
death is inside the bones, \n
like a barking where there are no dogs, \n
coming out from bells somewhere, from graves somewhere, \n
growing in the damp air like tears of rain. \n
Sometimes I see alone \n
coffins under sail, \n
embarking with the pale dead, with women that have dead hair, \n
with bakers who are as white as angels, \n
and pensive young girls married to notary publics, \n
caskets sailing up the vertical river of the dead, \n
the river of dark purple, \n
moving upstream with sails filled out by the sound of death, \n
filled by the sound of death which is silence. \n
Death arrives among all that sound \n
like a shoe with no foot in it, like a suit with no man in it, \n
comes and knocks, using a ring with no stone in it, with no \n
finger in it, \n
comes and shouts with no mouth, with no tongue, with no \n
throat. \n
Nevertheless its steps can be heard \n
and its clothing makes a hushed sound, like a tree. \n
I'm not sure, I understand only a little, I can hardly see, \n
but it seems to me that its singing has the color of damp violets, \n
of violets that are at home in the earth, \n
because the face of death is green, \n
and the look death gives is green, \n
with the penetrating dampness of a violet leaf \n
and the somber color of embittered winter. \n
But death also goes through the world dressed as a broom, \n
lapping the floor, looking for dead bodies, \n
death is inside the broom, \n
the broom is the tongue of death looking for corpses, \n
it is the needle of death looking for thread. \n
Death is inside the folding cots: \n
it spends its life sleeping on the slow mattresses, \n
in the black blankets, and suddenly breathes out: \n
it blows out a mournful sound that swells the sheets, \n
and the beds go sailing toward a port \n
where death is waiting, dressed like an admiral. \n

death \n
it sits outside my window now \n

I slam the screen with a newspaper \n
like slapping at a fly \n

death \n
THE warder looks down at the mid hour of night, \n
On the tombs that lie scatter'd below: \n
The moon fills the place with her silvery light, \n
And the churchyard like day seems to glow. \n
When see! first one grave, then another opes wide, \n
And women and men stepping forth are descried, \n
In cerements snow-white and trailing. \n
In haste for the sport soon their ankles they twitch, \n
And whirl round in dances so gay; \n
The young and the old, and the poor, and the rich, \n
But the cerements stand in their way; \n
And as modesty cannot avail them aught here, \n
They shake themselves all, and the shrouds soon appear \n
Scatter'd over the tombs in confusion. \n
Now waggles the leg, and now wriggles the thigh, \n
As the troop with strange gestures advance, \n
And a rattle and clatter anon rises high, \n
As of one beating time to the dance. \n
The sight to the warder seems wondrously queer, \n
When the villainous Tempter speaks thus in his ear: \n
"Seize one of the shrouds that lie yonder!" \n
Quick as thought it was done! and for safety he fled \n
Behind the church-door with all speed; \n
The moon still continues her clear light to shed \n
On the dance that they fearfully lead. \n
But the dancers at length disappear one by one, \n
And their shrouds, ere they vanish, they carefully don, \n
And under the turf all is quiet. \n
But one of them stumbles and shuffles there still, \n
And gropes at the graves in despair; \n
Yet 'tis by no comrade he's treated so ill \n
The shroud he soon scents in the air. \n
So he rattles the door--for the warder 'tis well \n
That 'tis bless'd, and so able the foe to repel, \n
All cover'd with crosses in metal. \n
The shroud he must have, and no rest will allow, \n
There remains for reflection no time; \n
On the ornaments Gothic the wight seizes now, \n
And from point on to point hastes to climb. \n
Alas for the warder! his doom is decreed! \n
Like a long-legged spider, with ne'er-changing speed, \n
Advances the dreaded pursuer. \n
The warder he quakes, and the warder turns pale, \n
The shroud to restore fain had sought; \n
When the end,--now can nothing to save him avail,-- \n
In a tooth formed of iron is caught. \n
With vanishing lustre the moon's race is run, \n
When the bell thunders loudly a powerful One, \n
And the skeleton fails, crush'd to atoms. \n<|endoftext|>

They put a leather belt around her \n
13 feet of tape and bound her \n
Handcuffs to secure her \n
And only God knows what else, \n
She's illegal, so deport her \n
Said the Empire that brought her \n
She died, \n
Nobody killed her \n
And she never killed herself. \n
It is our job to make her \n
Return to Jamaica \n
Said the Alien Deporters \n
Who deports people like me, \n
It was said she had a warning \n
That the officers were calling \n
On that deadly July morning \n
As her young son watched TV. \n
An officer unplugged the phone \n
Mother and child were now alone \n
When all they wanted was a home \n
A child watch Mummy die, \n
No matter what the law may say \n
A mother should not die this way \n
Let human rights come into play \n
And to everyone apply. \n
I know not of a perfect race \n
I know not of a perfect place \n
I know this is not a simple case \n
Of Yardies on the move, \n
We must talk some Race Relations \n
With the folks from immigration \n
About this kind of deportation \n
If things are to improve. \n
Let it go down in history \n
The word is that officially \n
She died democratically \n
In 13 feet of tape, \n
That Christian was over here \n
Because pirates were over there \n
The Bible sent us everywhere \n
To make Great Britain great. \n
Here lies the extradition squad \n
And we should all now pray to God \n
That as they go about their job \n
They make not one mistake, \n
For I fear as I walk the streets \n
That one day I just may meet \n
Officials who may tie my feet \n
And how would I escape. \n
I see my people demonstrating \n
And educated folks debating \n
The way they're separating \n
The elder from the youth, \n
When all they are demanding \n
Is a little overstanding \n
They too have family planning \n
Now their children want the truth. \n
As I move around I am eyeing \n
So many poets crying \n
And so many poets trying \n
To articulate the grief, \n
I cannot help but wonder \n
How the alien deporters \n
(As they said to press reporters) \n
Can feel absolute relief. \n<|endoftext|>
death \n
We lack all knowledge of this parting. Death \n
does not deal with us. We have no reason \n
to show death admiration, love or hate; \n
his mask of feigned tragic lament gives us \n
a false impression. The world's stage is still \n
filled with roles which we play. While we worry \n
that our performances may not please, \n
death also performs, although to no applause. \n
But as you left us, there broke upon this stage \n
a glimpse of reality, shown through the slight \n
opening through which you dissapeared: green, \n
evergreen, bathed in sunlight, actual woods. \n
We keep on playiing, still anxious, our difficult roles \n
declaiming, accompanied by matching gestures \n
as required. But your presence so suddenly \n
removed from our midst and from our play, at times \n
overcomes us like a sense of that other \n
reality: yours, that we are so overwhelmed \n
and play our actual lives instead of the performance, \n
forgetting altogehter the applause. \n

From rest and sleepe, which but thy pictures bee, \n
Much pleasure, then from thee, much more must flow, \n

Thou art slave to Fate, Chance, kings, and desperate men, \n
And dost with poyson, warre, and sicknesse dwell, \n
And poppie, or charmes can make us sleepe as well, \n

Hail, holy man, arriv'd th' immortal shore, \n

hospital gown always flap \n

FROM dark abodes to fair etherial light \n
Th' enraptur'd innocent has wing'd her flight; \n
On the kind bosom of eternal love \n

This known, ye parents, nor her loss deplore, \n

The dispensations of unerring grace, \n
Should turn your sorrows into grateful praise; \n
Let then no tears for her henceforward flow, \n
No more distress'd in our dark vale below, \n
Her morning sun, which rose divinely bright, \n
Was quickly mantled with the gloom of night; \n
But hear in heav'n's blest bow'rs your Nancy fair, \n
And learn to imitate her language there. \n
"Thou, Lord, whom I behold with glory crown'd, \n

"Infinite love and majesty to paint. \n
"To thee let all their graceful voices raise, \n
"And saints and angels join their songs of praise." \n
Perfect in bliss she from her heav'nly home \n
Looks down, and smiling beckons you to come; \n
Why then, fond parents, why these fruitless groans? \n
Restrain your tears, and cease your plaintive moans. \n
Freed from a world of sin, and snares, and pain, \n
Why would you wish your daughter back again? \n
No--bow resign'd. Let hope your grief control, \n
And check the rising tumult of the soul. \n
Calm in the prosperous, and adverse day, \n
Adore the God who gives and takes away; \n
Eye him in all, his holy name revere, \n
Upright your actions, and your hearts sincere, \n
Till having sail'd through life's tempestuous sea, \n
And from its rocks, and boist'rous billows free, \n
Yourselves, safe landed on the blissful shore, \n
Shall join your happy babe to part no more. \n<|endoftext|>

There’s a mirror likeness between those two \n
shining, youthfully-fledged figures, though \n
one seems paler than the other and more austere, \n
I might even say more perfect, more distinguished, \n
than he, who would take me confidingly in his arms – \n

Then, it might well have been that his wreath \n
of white poppies gently touched my forehead, at times, \n
and drove the pain from my mind with its strange scent. \n
But that is transient. I can only, now, be well, \n
when the other one, so serious and pale, \n
the older brother, lowers his dark torch. – \n

He is haulted by there souls. \n
For he knows in this battle, hatred rules one's goal. \n
He does not fight for hatred, \n
He fights for there lives instead. \n
Cause he knows hatred has no value, when so many are dead. \n
As he lays in death, knowing it will come, \n

For on the battlefield, life is as precious as gold. \n
And one must always choose should it be friend or foe? \n

If we who sight along it round the world, \n
See nothing worthy to have been its mark, \n
It is because like men we look too near, \n

Our missiles always make too short an arc. \n
They fall, they rip the grass, they intersect \n
The curve of earth, and striking, break their own; \n

soldier \n
'Oh! he's nothing but a soldier,' \n
But he's coming here tonight, \n
For I saw him pass this morning, \n
With his uniform so bright. \n
He was coming in from picket, \n
Whilst he sung a sweet refrain, \n
And he kissed his hand at some one \n
Peeping through the window pane. \n
Ah! he rode no dashing charger \n
'With a black and flowing mane,' \n
But his bayonet glistened brightly, \n
As the sun lit up the plain. \n
No waving plume or feather \n
Flashed its crimson in the light - \n
He belonged to the Light Infantry, \n
And he came to war- to fight. \n
'Oh! he's nothing but a soldier,' \n
His trust is in his sword - \n
To carve his way to glory, \n
Through the servile Yankee horde. \n
No pompous pageant heralds him, \n
No sycophants attend, \n
In his belt you see his body guard - \n
His tried and trusty friend. \n
'Oh! he's nothing but a soldier,' \n
And a stranger in our land; \n
His home is in the sunny South, \n
By the blue Gulf's golden strand. \n
But I wish I knew his people, \n
Some little of his past, \n
For father's always telling me \n
About our 'social caste'. \n
'Oh! he's nothing but a soldier,' \n
But his eyes are very fine, \n
And I sometimes think, when passing, \n
They are piercing into mine. \n
Pshaw! 'He's nothing but a soldier,' \n
Come, let me be discreet; \n
But really, for a soldier, \n
His toilet's very neat. \n
'Oh! he's nothing but a soldier,' \n
But last night he came to tea - \n
What an interesting soldier - \n
But then, he's rather free. \n
'Twas two o'clock this morning, \n
Before he took his leave; \n
He has my ring - the fellow! \n
But what's the use to grieve? \n
He has been again to see us, \n
The 'gentleman' in grey; \n
He calls to see us often - \n
Our house is on his way \n
At times he sadly seeks the shade \n
Of yonder grove of trees, \n
I watched him once - this soldier - \n
I saw him on his knees. \n
One day last week I asked him \n
To tell me of his home. \n
He answered, pointing to his camp, \n
'Where'er these brave ones roam.' \n
I asked him once to tell me \n
Of his mother, sister dear; \n
A funeral cortege passed along - \n
Said he, 'You have them here.' \n
'Oh, he's nothing but a soldier,' \n
But this I know right well, \n
He has a heart of softness \n
Where tender virtues dwell; \n
For once when we were talking, \n
And no one else was near, \n
I saw him very plainly \n
Try to hide a startling tear. \n
We are speaking of Manassas, \n
Of that first great bloody day, \n
When a handful of our 'bra'e ones' \n
Held the Yankee hosts at bay. \n
'Twas here he lost his aged sire, \n
While fighting by his side; \n
He sleeps beneath the crimson turf, \n
Where roil'd that bloody tide. \n
'Oh, he's nothing but a soldier,' \n
But within that eye so clear, \n
There lurks no craven spirit, \n
No timid glance of fear; \n
For though at pity's pleading \n
It can melt with tender light, \n
I've seen it flash like lightning \n
Across the brow of night. \n
'Oh, he's nothing but a soldier,' \n
Such as pass us every day. \n
He calls them 'Ragged Devils,' \n
But you know that's just his way. \n
But there is one thing very funny, \n
One thing I can't explain \n
That when this soldier goes away, \n
I wish him back again. \n
'Oh, he's nothing but a soldier,' \n
And a stranger yet to fame; \n
But they tell me in the army, \n
That the 'Boys' all know his name; \n
The Yankees, too, have heard it, \n
They dread his battle shout; \n
They have no wish to meet him, \n
This dreaded Southern scout. \n
'Oh, he's nothing but a soldier,' \n
Yet you'd call his features good; \n
That cut he got at West Point, \n
While fighting under Hood. \n
He has a halting in his gait, \n
A trifle in the knee; \n
He brought it back from Sharpsburg, \n
Where he went with General Lee. \n
'Oh, he's nothing but a soldier,' \n
But his triumphs are not few; \n
He has seen our glorious battle flag \n
In all its trials through; \n
At Seven Pines he followed it, \n
On the heights at Gaines' Mill; \n
At Williamsburg, at West Point, \n
In the smoke of Malvern Hill. \n
Oh, he's nothing but a soldier, \n
But, then, its very queer - \n
I feel somehow when absent \n
I'd rather have him near. \n
He's gone to meet the foeman, \n
To stay his bloody track - \n
O! Heaven shield the soldier, \n
O, God, let him come back! \n
He is back again, this soldier, \n
With his eyes so deep and clear, \n
And his voice like falling waters, \n
Maketh music to my ear. \n
One empty coat-sleeve dangles, \n
Where once a stout arm grew, \n
But this soldier says, in hugging \n
He has no use for two. \n
'Oh, he's nothing but a soldier,' \n
And I know that on his form \n
He bears the scars of conflict \n
And of many a battle storm. \n
But I wouldn't give this soldier, \n
In his simple, humble home, \n
For all your perfumed monkeys, \n
That strut about the town. \n
He is back again, this soldier; \n
He is sitting by my side, \n
Tomorrow, ho! for Texas \n
With his young Virginia bride. \n
True, 'he's nothing but a soldier,' \n
But I'm now his loving wife; \n
Pledged, through good report, or evil, \n
To dwell with him through life. \n<|endoftext|>

Ode to the Fallen soldier, \n
For he has made the ultimate \n
Sacrifice for his world. \n
Ode to his Mother for while \n
She lives, the grief and sadness \n
Take their toll on her mind, as \n
She goes throughout her day, \n
Answering questions like “are \n
You ok? ” and “where is your \n
Son, I haven’t seen him for a while? ” \n
She always answers, “yes I’m fine” \n
Or, “he’s away.” But she knows, inside, \n
She can’t deny. \n
Ode to the son he left behind, \n
For he will grow up without \n
Knowing who his father is, \n
Only what he’s done. Never \n
Will he play catch in the yard, \n
Like the neighbors next door. \n
Never will he hear that “Man to \n
Man” talk, that all boys should. \n
Ode to the music that will never \n
Be heard, for the only music \n
He made, rests in his heart. \n
Ode to the art that will never be \n
Seen, for the only art he made, \n
Remains in a box underground. \n
Ode to the Fallen Soldier, who \n
Died so we could live, the way \n
All mankind should, happy and free. \n<|endoftext|>

If I should die, think only this of me: \n
That there's some corner of a foreign field \n
That is for ever England. There shall be \n
In that rich earth a richer dust concealed; \n
A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware, \n
Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam, \n
A body of England's, breathing English air, \n
Washed by the rivers, blest by suns of home. \n
And think, this heart, all evil shed away, \n
A pulse in the eternal mind, no less \n
Gives somewhere back the thoughts by England given; \n
Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day; \n
And laughter, learnt of friends; and gentleness, \n
In hearts at peace, under an English heaven. \n<|endoftext|>

There is a flag on the door, and joy left on the floor, \n
A woman sobs all day long crying to the tune of an old song \n
A voice cries “Where is he, Where is he? ” \n
This voice haunts the woman and emphasizes all her wants \n
There is letter in the mail that tells the tail \n
She opens the letter asking…. \n
“where is he, where is he.” \n
There is a baby cold and lonely, lonely to come \n
With tears that are not formed yet, nor even a thought \n
In a cradle to the side longing for the second face…… \n
The letter answered the woman……….. \n
“Your husband died a glorious death, and lived a humble life, \n
And yet now we grieve to see that this man is dead” \n

My fear is my weakness, Let my weakness be gone. \n

But push on I'm on a soldier, The stronger of some. \n

Soldier in your chair of anger \n
all alone with your deepest pain. \n
For the way that people now look at you \n
over and over and over again. \n
You fought a war that was not your own \n
on foreign land so far away. \n
Then came home to loved ones family and friends \n
in a much, much different way. \n
Your legs removed your arms now gone \n
we welcomed you back with flags and patriotic songs. \n
But now you sit forgotten and alone \n
while away the bank has taken your home. \n
So why not sit in the anger you feel? \n

You fought to protect a world unknown \n

Daymare demons spiral your head. \n
There is no rest in your soft bed. \n
Images of death reveal. \n
The guilt you hide, but feel. \n
A war of shadows. \n
Where you once fought. \n
In back gardens where children play \n
For only peace you wished and sought. \n
The grass green hills of your childhood remain. \n
But there, there was no death sign \n
Wife and kids you greet at garden gate. \n
They don’t see your inner hate. \n
They don’t see your embroiled conscience, \n
or know the infliction you bare. \n
They’re only too happy to have you home. \n
Home to love and share. \n
You are a soldier home. \n
A soldier home from a war, \n
Trying your guilt to hide. \n
Trying to forget the child you shot, that died. \n
The war was someone else’s. \n
Why should you really care? \n
It only really strikes home, \n
when you see a child dying there. \n
Visions cloud your mind of voices in despair. \n
Why did we have to die so young? \n
Why did our mother’s have to mourn? \n
Soldier from another land, please tell us why? \n
The soldier’s forehead frowns. \n
The answer he can not give. \n
He was only sent there. \n
So other have a chance to live. \n
Now his war is over. \n
Over his home he now resides. \n
But the voices of despair. \n
Still ring in his head. \n
He cries to himself in silence. \n
How can his conscience bare. \n
The purgatory it must go through. \n
Knowing he killed a child fair. \n

Home furthest off grows dearer from the way; \n
And when the army in the Indias lay \n
Friends' letters coming from his native place \n
Were like old neighbours with their country face. \n
And every opportunity that came \n
Opened the sheet to gaze upon the name \n
Of that loved village where he left his sheep \n
For more contented peaceful folk to keep; \n
And friendly faces absent many a year \n
Would from such letters in his mind appear. \n
And when his pockets, chafing through the case, \n
Wore it quite out ere others took the place, \n
Right loath to be of company bereft \n
He kept the fragments while a bit was left. \n<|endoftext|>

My soldier boy has crossed the sea \n
To fight the foeman; \n
But he'll come back to make of me \n
And honest woman. \n
So I am singing all day long, \n
Despite blood-shedding; \n
For though I know he's done me wrong, \n
We'll end by wedding. \n
My soldier boy is home again, \n
So bold and scathless; \n
But oh, my heart is numb with pain \n
Because he's faithless. \n
He's brought with him a French Mam'selle; \n
They plan a marriage; \n
Maybe I'll go - no one will know \n
Of my miscarriage. \n
My soldier boy has made his choice, \n
She'll hold him to it; \n

May he not rue it. \n
But oh, that starry month of May, \n
Love-words wild spoken! \n

He was a brave soldier he died young and brave \n
And for more than six decades he lay in his grave \n
And still at the dawning of each war memorial day \n
At his grave site a young bugler the last post does play. \n
Known as the Unknown Soldier one without a name \n
Still he had a mum and a dad just the same \n
And when he did not return home when the fighting was done \n
They grieved at their loss and they wept for their son. \n
The war to end all wars of all wars 'tis said \n
But more wars are fought and we have more war dead \n
And at the grave of the unknown soldier the last post is played \n
And to honour the war dead another parade. \n
Old war men do tell us young soldiers fight and die \n
For freedom and liberty that is a lie \n
They went to war when young they are now old and gray \n
Some grow old not wiser some are known to say. \n
That they were fighting for freedom and justice they believed to be true \n
And they were quite gallant to give them their due \n
But many deprived of their human rights in the World of today \n
And that does seem a very sad thing for to say. \n
With heads bowed old men showing their years in gray \n
At the grave of the Unknown Soldier at the dawn of the day \n
In silence do listen as a young bugler the last post does play \n
For one who fought and died in a war far away. \n<|endoftext|>

'Sweetheart, take this,' a soldier said, \n
'And bid me brave good-by; \n
It may befall we ne'er shall wed, \n
But love can never die. \n
Be steadfast in thy troth to me, \n
And then, whate'er my lot, \n
'My soul to God, my heart to thee,'- \n
Sweetheart, forget me not! ' \n
The maiden took the tiny flower \n
And nursed it with her tears: \n
Lo! he who left her in that hour \n
Came not in after years. \n
Unto a hero's death he rode \n
'Mid shower of fire and shot; \n
But in the maiden's heart abode \n
The flower, forget-me-not. \n
And when he came not with the rest \n
From out the years of blood, \n
Closely unto her widowed breast \n
She pressed a faded bud; \n
Oh, there is love and there is pain, \n
And there is peace, God wot,- \n
And these dear three do live again \n
In sweet forget-me-not. \n
'T is to an unmarked grave to-day \n
That I should love to go,- \n
Whether he wore the blue or gray, \n
What need that we should know? \n
'He loved a woman,' let us say, \n
And on that sacred spot, \n
To woman's love, that lives for aye, \n
We'll strew forget-me-not. \n

The Militant Soldier Boy \n
Lies dying. In shame, \n
His body lies in disgrace, \n
Because he could no longer face \n
The Innocents. \n
The Innocents, the ones who died \n
At his hand in that foreign land. \n
He saw them in his dreams. \n
He saw them when he was awake, \n
Or walking about his hometown, \n
His place of safety, his refuge. \n
They stood beside him \n
At the altar \n
Of his church, \n
And when he was at work, \n
Until he could no longer face \n
The Innocents. \n
And so, with his Soldier Boy's \n
Tattered Honor gathered about him, \n
His heart gave a sigh. \n
He decided he must die, \n
Shamed and alone, \n
Like the Innocents. \n
Dedicated to all soldiers who must live with the horror of death. \n

Lest the young soldiers be strange in heaven, \n
God bids the old soldier they all adored \n
Come to Him and wait for them, clean, new-shriven, \n
A happy doorkeeper in the House of the Lord. \n
Lest it abash them, the strange new splendour, \n
Lest it affright them, the new robes clean; \n
Here's an old face, now, long-tried, and tender, \n
A word and a hand-clasp as they troop in. \n
'My boys,' he greets them: and heaven is homely, \n

Won back to the world again, \n
Lost and won in a breath, \n
Cruel men are made immortal, \n
Out of your pain born. \n
They have stolen the sun’s power \n
With their feet on your shoulders worn. \n

soldier \n
I mind the river from Mount Frome \n
To Ballanshantie’s Bridge, \n
The Mudgee Hills, and Buckaroo, \n
Lowe’s Peak, and Granite Ridge. \n
The “tailers” in the creek beneath, \n
The rugged she-oak boles, \n
The river cod where shallows linked, \n
The willowed water-holes. \n
I mind the blacksoil river flats, \n
The red soil levels, too, \n
The sidings where below the scrub \n
The golden wattles grew; \n
The track that ran by Tierney’s Gap, \n
The dusk and ghost alarms, \n
The glorious morning on the hills, \n
And all the German farms. \n
I mind the blue-grey gully bush, \n
The slab-and-shingle school, \n
The “soldier birds” that picked the crumbs \n
Beneath the infants’ stool. \n
(Ah! did those little soldier birds, \n
That whispered, ever know \n
That one of us should rise so high \n
And sadly sink so low?) \n
I mind the lessons that we droned \n
In books from Irish schools, \n
The canings and the keepings-in \n
For breaking bounds and rules. \n
Ah! little did the teacher dream \n
That one of us, perchance, \n
Might write in London to be read \n
In Germany and France. \n
I mind the days we played at camp \n
With billy-can and swag, \n
I mind the notes sent home by girls \n
When someone “played the wag.” \n
Ah! little did the master think \n
(Who’d lost the roving star) \n
What truants in their after years \n
Would play the wag so far. \n
I mind when first he gave to me \n
A pen and ink to write, \n
And, last, the “Fourth Class Forms” he made \n
I shared with Lucy White. \n
The other boys were other boys, \n
With cricket ball and bat, \n
They had a fine contempt for girls, \n
But they got over that. \n
The “rounders” where the girls came in— \n
The Tomboy and the rest— \n
The earnest game of Pris’ners’ Base— \n
The game that I liked best. \n
The kangarooing on the ridge, \n
And in the brown moonlight, \n
The “possuming” across the flats, \n
With dogs and gun at night. \n
The “specking” in old diggers’ heaps \n
For “colours” after rain, \n
The horse-shoes saved against the time \n
The circus came again, \n
And sold to Jimmy Siver-right— \n
The blacksmith on the flat; \n
The five-corners, the swimming hole— \n
Oh! I remember that! \n
I mind the holland “dinner bags”— \n
A book bag of green baize— \n
The bread and dripping, bread and meat, \n
And bread and treacle days. \n
The bread and butter swopped for meat, \n
The crumb we swopped for crust— \n
We’ve married—and divorced—since then, \n
And most old homes are dust. \n
It was the time, it was the place— \n
Australia’s hardest page— \n
When boys were cast for farming work \n
At fourteen years of age. \n
It was the time, it was the place, \n
The latter “Early Day,” \n
When boys ride home from old bark schools \n
And to the world away. \n
I’ve drifted through Port Said since then, \n
Naples and Leicester Square, \n
And Collins and Macquarie Streets— \n
I know the secrets there. \n
Ah me! The country boy and girl, \n
The country lass and lad, \n
As innocent as soldier birds, \n
Though we thought we were bad! \n
But, spite of all their daring truth, \n
And some work that shall last, \n
The bitter years of my brave youth \n
Are better in the past. \n
This does not call for bitterness, \n
Nor does it call for tears, \n
The purest little thing perhaps \n
I’ve printed here for years. \n
The railway runs by Mudgee Hills, \n
Old farms are lost or lone, \n
And children’s children sadly go \n
To schools of brick and stone. \n
Yet are the same. The Mudgee Hills \n
And Mudgee skies as fair— \n
And the little grey-clad soldier birds \n
Are just as busy there. \n<|endoftext|>
sorrow \n
I \n
A traveller on the skirt of Sarum's Plain \n
Pursued his vagrant way, with feet half bare; \n
Stooping his gait, but not as if to gain \n
Help from the staff he bore; for mien and air \n
Were hardy, though his cheek seemed worn with care \n
Both of the time to come, and time long fled: \n
Down fell in straggling locks his thin grey hair; \n
A coat he wore of military red \n
But faded, and stuck o'er with many a patch and shred. \n
II \n
While thus he journeyed, step by step led on, \n
He saw and passed a stately inn, full sure \n
That welcome in such house for him was none. \n
No board inscribed the needy to allure \n
Hung there, no bush proclaimed to old and poor \n
And desolate, "Here you will find a friend!" \n
The pendent grapes glittered above the door;-- \n
On he must pace, perchance 'till night descend, \n
Where'er the dreary roads their bare white lines extend. \n
III \n
The gathering clouds grow red with stormy fire, \n
In streaks diverging wide and mounting high; \n
That inn he long had passed; the distant spire, \n
Which oft as he looked back had fixed his eye, \n
Was lost, though still he looked, in the blank sky. \n
Perplexed and comfortless he gazed around, \n
And scarce could any trace of man descry, \n
Save cornfields stretched and stretching without bound; \n
But where the sower dwelt was nowhere to be found. \n
IV \n
No tree was there, no meadow's pleasant green, \n
No brook to wet his lip or soothe his ear; \n
Long files of corn-stacks here and there were seen, \n
But not one dwelling-place his heart to cheer. \n
Some labourer, thought he, may perchance be near; \n
And so he sent a feeble shout--in vain; \n
No voice made answer, he could only hear \n
Winds rustling over plots of unripe grain, \n
Or whistling thro' thin grass along the unfurrowed plain. \n
V \n
Long had he fancied each successive slope \n
Concealed some cottage, whither he might turn \n
And rest; but now along heaven's darkening cope \n
The crows rushed by in eddies, homeward borne. \n
Thus warned he sought some shepherd's spreading thorn \n
Or hovel from the storm to shield his head, \n
But sought in vain; for now, all wild, forlorn, \n
And vacant, a huge waste around him spread; \n
The wet cold ground, he feared, must be his only bed. \n
VI \n
And be it so--for to the chill night shower \n
And the sharp wind his head he oft hath bared; \n
A Sailor he, who many a wretched hour \n
Hath told; for, landing after labour hard, \n
Full long endured in hope of just reward, \n
He to an armed fleet was forced away \n
By seamen, who perhaps themselves had shared \n
Like fate; was hurried off, a helpless prey, \n
'Gainst all that in 'his' heart, or theirs perhaps, said nay. \n
VII \n
For years the work of carnage did not cease, \n
And death's dire aspect daily he surveyed, \n
Death's minister; then came his glad release, \n
And hope returned, and pleasure fondly made \n
Her dwelling in his dreams. By Fancy's aid \n
The happy husband flies, his arms to throw \n
Round his wife's neck; the prize of victory laid \n
In her full lap, he sees such sweet tears flow \n
As if thenceforth nor pain nor trouble she could know. \n
VIII \n
Vain hope! for frand took all that he had earned. \n
The lion roars and gluts his tawny brood \n
Even in the desert's heart; but he, returned, \n
Bears not to those he loves their needful food. \n
His home approaching, but in such a mood \n
That from his sight his children might have run. \n
He met a traveller, robbed him, shed his blood; \n
And when the miserable work was done \n
He fled, a vagrant since, the murderer's fate to shun. \n
IX \n
From that day forth no place to him could be \n
So lonely, but that thence might come a pang \n
Brought from without to inward misery. \n
Now, as he plodded on, with sullen clang \n
A sound of chains along the desert rang; \n
He looked, and saw upon a gibbet high \n
A human body that in irons swang, \n
Uplifted by the tempest whirling by; \n
And, hovering, round it often did a raven fly. \n
X \n
It was a spectacle which none might view, \n
In spot so savage, but with shuddering pain; \n
Nor only did for him at once renew \n
All he had feared from man, but roused a train \n
Of the mind's phantoms, horrible as vain. \n
The stones, as if to cover him from day, \n
Rolled at his back along the living plain; \n
He fell, and without sense or motion lay; \n
But, when the trance was gone, feebly pursued his way. \n
XI \n
As one whose brain habitual phrensy fires \n
Owes to the fit in which his soul hath tossed \n
Profounder quiet, when the fit retires, \n
Even so the dire phantasma which had crossed \n
His sense, in sudden vacancy quite lost, \n
Left his mind still as a deep evening stream. \n
Nor, if accosted now, in thought engrossed, \n
Moody, or inly troubled, would he seem \n
To traveller who might talk of any casual theme. \n
XII \n
Hurtle the clouds in deeper darkness piled, \n
Gone is the raven timely rest to seek; \n
He seemed the only creature in the wild \n
On whom the elements their rage might wreak; \n
Save that the bustard, of those regions bleak \n
Shy tenant, seeing by the uncertain light \n
A man there wandering, gave a mournful shriek, \n
And half upon the ground, with strange affright, \n
Forced hard against the wind a thick unwieldy flight. \n
XIII \n
All, all was cheerless to the horizon's bound; \n
The weary eye--which, wheresoe'er it strays, \n
Marks nothing but the red sun's setting round, \n
Or on the earth strange lines, in former days \n
Left by gigantic arms--at length surveys \n
What seems an antique castle spreading wide; \n
Hoary and naked are its walls, and raise \n
Their brow sublime: in shelter there to bide \n
He turned, while rain poured down smoking on every side. \n
XIV \n
Pile of Stone-henge! so proud to hint yet keep \n
Thy secrets, thou that lov'st to stand and hear \n
The Plain resounding to the whirlwind's sweep, \n
Inmate of lonesome Nature's endless year; \n
Even if thou saw'st the giant wicker rear \n
For sacrifice its throngs of living men, \n
Before thy face did ever wretch appear, \n
Who in his heart had groaned with deadlier pain \n
Than he who, tempest-driven, thy shelter now would gain. \n
XV \n
Within that fabric of mysterious form, \n
Winds met in conflict, each by turns supreme; \n
And, from the perilous ground dislodged, through storm \n
And rain he wildered on, no moon to stream \n
From gulf of parting clouds one friendly beam, \n
Nor any friendly sound his footsteps led; \n
Once did the lightning's faint disastrous gleam \n
Disclose a naked guide-post's double head, \n
Sight which tho' lost at once a gleam of pleasure shed. \n
XVI \n
No swinging sign-board creaked from cottage elm \n
To stay his steps with faintness overcome; \n
'Twas dark and void as ocean's watery realm \n
Roaring with storms beneath night's starless gloom; \n
No gipsy cowered o'er fire of furze or broom; \n
No labourer watched his red kiln glaring bright, \n
Nor taper glimmered dim from sick man's room; \n
Along the waste no line of mournful light \n
From lamp of lonely toll-gate streamed athwart the night. \n
XVII \n
At length, though hid in clouds, the moon arose; \n
The downs were visible--and now revealed \n
A structure stands, which two bare slopes enclose. \n
It was a spot, where, ancient vows fulfilled, \n
Kind pious hands did to the Virgin build \n
A lonely Spital, the belated swain \n
From the night terrors of that waste to shield: \n
But there no human being could remain, \n
And now the walls are named the "Dead House" of the plain. \n
XVIII \n
Though he had little cause to love the abode \n
Of man, or covet sight of mortal face, \n
Yet when faint beams of light that ruin showed, \n
How glad he was at length to find some trace \n
Of human shelter in that dreary place. \n
Till to his flock the early shepherd goes, \n
Here shall much-needed sleep his frame embrace. \n
In a dry nook where fern the floor bestrows \n
He lays his stiffened limbs,--his eyes begin to close; \n
XIX \n
When hearing a deep sigh, that seemed to come \n
From one who mourned in sleep, he raised his head, \n
And saw a woman in the naked room \n
Outstretched, and turning on a restless bed: \n
The moon a wan dead light around her shed. \n
He waked her--spake in tone that would not fail, \n
He hoped, to calm her mind; but ill he sped, \n
For of that ruin she had heard a tale \n
Which now with freezing thoughts did all her powers assail; \n
XX \n
Had heard of one who, forced from storms to shroud, \n
Felt the loose walls of this decayed Retreat \n
Rock to incessant neighings shrill and loud, \n
While his horse pawed the floor with furious heat; \n
Till on a stone, that sparkled to his feet, \n
Struck, and still struck again, the troubled horse: \n
The man half raised the stone with pain and sweat, \n
Half raised, for well his arm might lose its force \n
Disclosing the grim head of a late murdered corse. \n
XXI \n
Such tale of this lone mansion she had learned \n
And, when that shape, with eyes in sleep half drowned, \n
By the moon's sullen lamp she first discerned, \n
Cold stony horror all her senses bound. \n
Her he addressed in words of cheering sound; \n
Recovering heart, like answer did she make; \n
And well it was that, of the corse there found, \n
In converse that ensued she nothing spake; \n
She knew not what dire pangs in him such tale could wake. \n
XXII \n
But soon his voice and words of kind intent \n
Banished that dismal thought; and now the wind \n
In fainter howlings told its 'rage' was spent: \n
Meanwhile discourse ensued of various kind, \n
Which by degrees a confidence of mind \n
And mutual interest failed not to create. \n
And, to a natural sympathy resigned, \n
In that forsaken building where they sate \n
The Woman thus retraced her own untoward fate. \n
XXIII \n
"By Derwent's side my father dwelt--a man \n
Of virtuous life, by pious parents bred; \n
And I believe that, soon as I began \n
To lisp, he made me kneel beside my bed, \n
And in his hearing there my prayers I said: \n
And afterwards, by my good father taught, \n
I read, and loved the books in which I read; \n
For books in every neighbouring house I sought, \n
And nothing to my mind a sweeter pleasure brought. \n
XXIV \n
"A little croft we owned--a plot of corn, \n
A garden stored with peas, and mint, and thyme, \n
And flowers for posies, oft on Sunday morn \n
Plucked while the church bells rang their earliest chime. \n
Can I forget our freaks at shearing time! \n
My hen's rich nest through long grass scarce espied; \n
The cowslip-gathering in June's dewy prime; \n
The swans that with white chests upreared in pride \n
Rushing and racing came to meet me at the water-side. \n
XXV \n
"The staff I well remember which upbore \n
The bending body of my active sire; \n
His seat beneath the honied sycamore \n
Where the bees hummed, and chair by winter fire; \n
When market-morning came, the neat attire \n
With which, though bent on haste, myself I decked; \n
Our watchful house-dog, that would tease and tire \n
The stranger till its barking-fit I checked; \n
The red-breast, known for years, which at my casement pecked. \n
XXVI \n
"The suns of twenty summers danced along,-- \n
Too little marked how fast they rolled away: \n
But, through severe mischance and cruel wrong, \n
My father's substance fell into decay: \n
We toiled and struggled, hoping for a day \n
When Fortune might put on a kinder look; \n
But vain were wishes, efforts vain as they; \n
He from his old hereditary nook \n
Must part; the summons came;--our final leave we took. \n
XXVII \n
"It was indeed a miserable hour \n
When, from the last hill-top, my sire surveyed, \n
Peering above the trees, the steeple tower \n
That on his marriage day sweet music made! \n
Tilt then, he hoped his bones might there be laid \n
Close by my mother in their native bowers: \n
Bidding me trust in God, he stood and prayed;-- \n
I could not pray:--through tears that fell in showers \n
Glimmered our dear-loved home, alas! no longer ours! \n
XXVIII \n
"There was a Youth whom I had loved so long, \n
That when I loved him not I cannot say: \n
'Mid the green mountains many a thoughtless song \n
We two had sung, like gladsome birds in May; \n
When we began to tire of childish play, \n
We seemed still more and more to prize each other; \n
We talked of marriage and our marriage day; \n
And I in truth did love him like a brother, \n
For never could I hope to meet with such another. \n
XXIX \n
"Two years were passed since to a distant town \n
He had repaired to ply a gainful trade: \n
What tears of bitter grief, till then unknown! \n
What tender vows, our last sad kiss delayed! \n
To him we turned:--we had no other aid: \n
Like one revived, upon his neck I wept; \n
And her whom he had loved in joy, he said, \n
He well could love in grief; his faith he kept; \n
And in a quiet home once more my father slept. \n
XXX \n
"We lived in peace and comfort; and were blest \n
With daily bread, by constant toil supplied. \n
Three lovely babes had lain upon my breast; \n
And often, viewing their sweet smiles, I sighed, \n
And knew not why. My happy father died, \n
When threatened war reduced the children's meal: \n
Thrice happy! that for him the grave could hide \n
The empty loom, cold hearth, and silent wheel, \n
And tears that flowed for ills which patience might not heal. \n
XXXI \n
"'Twas a hard change; an evil time was come; \n
We had no hope, and no relief could gain: \n
But soon, with proud parade, the noisy drum \n
Beat round to clear the streets of want and pain. \n
My husband's arms now only served to strain \n
Me and his children hungering in his view; \n
In such dismay my prayers and tears were vain: \n
To join those miserable men he flew, \n
And now to the sea-coast, with numbers more, we drew. \n
XXXII \n
"There were we long neglected, and we bore \n
Much sorrow ere the fleet its anchor weighed; \n
Green fields before us, and our native shore, \n
We breathed a pestilential air, that made \n
Ravage for which no knell was heard. We prayed \n
For our departure; wished and wished--nor knew, \n
'Mid that long sickness and those hopes delayed, \n
That happier days we never more must view. \n
The parting signal streamed--at last the land withdrew. \n
XXXIII \n
"But the calm summer season now was past. \n
On as we drove, the equinoctial deep \n
Ran mountains high before the howling blast, \n
And many perished in the whirlwind's sweep. \n
We gazed with terror on their gloomy sleep, \n
Untaught that soon such anguish must ensue, \n
Our hopes such harvest of affliction reap, \n
That we the mercy of the waves should rue: \n
We reached the western world, a poor devoted crew. \n
XXXIV \n
"The pains and plagues that on our heads came down, \n
Disease and famine, agony and fear, \n
In wood or wilderness, in camp or town, \n
It would unman the firmest heart to hear. \n
All perished--all in one remorseless year, \n
Husband and children! one by one, by sword \n
And ravenous plague, all perished: every tear \n
Dried up, despairing, desolate, on board \n
A British ship I waked, as from a trance restored." \n
XXXV \n
Here paused she of all present thought forlorn, \n
Nor voice nor sound, that moment's pain expressed, \n
Yet Nature, with excess of grief o'erborne, \n
From her full eyes their watery load released. \n
He too was mute; and, ere her weeping ceased, \n
He rose, and to the ruin's portal went, \n
And saw the dawn opening the silvery east \n
With rays of promise, north and southward sent; \n
And soon with crimson fire kindled the firmament. \n
XXXVI \n
"O come," he cried, "come, after weary night \n
Of such rough storm, this happy change to view." \n
So forth she came, and eastward looked; the sight \n
Over her brow like dawn of gladness threw; \n
Upon her cheek, to which its youthful hue \n
Seemed to return, dried the last lingering tear, \n
And from her grateful heart a fresh one drew: \n
The whilst her comrade to her pensive cheer \n
Tempered fit words of hope; and the lark warbled near. \n
XXXVII \n
They looked and saw a lengthening road, and wain \n
That rang down a bare slope not far remote: \n
The barrows glistered bright with drops of rain, \n
Whistled the waggoner with merry note, \n
The cock far off sounded his clarion throat; \n
But town, or farm, or hamlet, none they viewed, \n
Only were told there stood a lonely cot \n
A long mile thence. While thither they pursued \n
Their way, the Woman thus her mournful tale renewed. \n
XXXVIII \n
"Peaceful as this immeasurable plain \n
Is now, by beams of dawning light imprest, \n
In the calm sunshine slept the glittering main; \n
The very ocean hath its hour of rest. \n
I too forgot the heavings of my breast. \n
How quiet 'round me ship and ocean were! \n
As quiet all within me. I was blest, \n
And looked, and fed upon the silent air \n
Until it seemed to bring a joy to my despair. \n
XXXIX \n
"Ah! how unlike those late terrific sleeps, \n
And groans that rage of racking famine spoke; \n
The unburied dead that lay in festering heaps, \n
The breathing pestilence that rose like smoke, \n
The shriek that from the distant battle broke, \n
The mine's dire earthquake, and the pallid host \n
Driven by the bomb's incessant thunderstroke \n
To loathsome vaults, where heart-sick anguish tossed, \n
Hope died, and fear itself in agony was lost! \n
XL \n
"Some mighty gulf of separation past, \n
I seemed transported to another world; \n
A thought resigned with pain, when from the mast \n
The impatient mariner the sail unfurled, \n
And, whistling, called the wind that hardly curled \n
The silent sea. From the sweet thoughts of home \n
And from all hope I was for ever hurled. \n
For me--farthest from earthly port to roam \n
Was best, could I but shun the spot where man might come. \n
XLI \n
"And oft I thought (my fancy was so strong) \n
That I, at last, a resting-place had found; \n
'Here will I dwell,' said I, 'my whole life long, \n
Roaming the illimitable waters round; \n
Here will I live, of all but heaven disowned, \n
And end my days upon the peaceful flood.'-- \n
To break my dream the vessel reached its bound; \n
And homeless near a thousand homes I stood, \n
And near a thousand tables pined and wanted food. \n
XLII \n
"No help I sought; in sorrow turned adrift, \n
Was hopeless, as if cast on some bare rock; \n
Nor morsel to my mouth that day did lift, \n
Nor raised my hand at any door to knock. \n
I lay where, with his drowsy mates, the cock \n
From the cross-timber of an out-house hung: \n
Dismally tolled, that night, the city clock! \n
At morn my sick heart hunger scarcely stung, \n
Nor to the beggar's language could I fit my tongue. \n
XLIII \n
"So passed a second day; and, when the third \n
Was come, I tried in vain the crowd's resort. \n
--In deep despair, by frightful wishes stirred, \n
Near the sea-side I reached a ruined fort; \n
There, pains which nature could no more support, \n
With blindness linked, did on my vitals fall; \n
And, after many interruptions short \n
Of hideous sense, I sank, nor step could crawl: \n
Unsought for was the help that did my life recall. \n
XLIV \n
"Borne to a hospital, I lay with brain \n
Drowsy and weak, and shattered memory; \n
I heard my neighbours in their beds complain \n
Of many things which never troubled me-- \n
Of feet still bustling round with busy glee, \n
Of looks where common kindness had no part, \n
Of service done with cold formality, \n
Fretting the fever round the languid heart, \n
And groans which, as they said, might make a dead man start. \n
XLV \n
"These things just served to stir the slumbering sense, \n
Nor pain nor pity in my bosom raised. \n
With strength did memory return; and, thence \n
Dismissed, again on open day I gazed, \n
At houses, men, and common light, amazed. \n
The lanes I sought, and, as the sun retired, \n
Came where beneath the trees a faggot blazed, \n
The travellers saw me weep, my fate inquired, \n
And gave me food--and rest, more welcome, more desired. \n
XLVI \n
"Rough potters seemed they, trading soberly \n
With panniered asses driven from door to door; \n
But life of happier sort set forth to me, \n
And other joys my fancy to allure-- \n
The bag-pipe dinning on the midnight moor \n
In barn uplighted; and companions boon, \n
Well met from far with revelry secure \n
Among the forest glades, while jocund June \n
Rolled fast along the sky his warm and genial moon. \n
XLVII \n
"But ill they suited me--those journeys dark \n
O'er moor and mountain, midnight theft to hatch! \n
To charm the surly house-dog's faithful bark, \n
Or hang on tip-toe at the lifted latch. \n
The gloomy lantern, and the dim blue match, \n
The black disguise, the warning whistle shrill, \n
And ear still busy on its nightly watch, \n
Were not for me, brought up in nothing ill: \n
Besides, on griefs so fresh my thoughts were brooding still. \n
XLVIII \n
"What could I do, unaided and unblest? \n
My father! gone was every friend of thine: \n
And kindred of dead husband are at best \n
Small help; and, after marriage such as mine, \n
With little kindness would to me incline. \n
Nor was I then for toil or service fit; \n
My deep-drawn sighs no effort could confine; \n
In open air forgetful would I sit \n
Whole hours, with idle arms in moping sorrow knit. \n
XLIX \n
"The roads I paced, I loitered through the fields; \n
Contentedly, yet sometimes self-accused. \n
Trusted my life to what chance bounty yields, \n
Now coldly given, now utterly refused. \n
The ground I for my bed have often used: \n
But what afflicts my peace with keenest ruth, \n
Is that I have my inner self abused, \n
Foregone the home delight of constant truth, \n
And clear and open soul, so prized in fearless youth. \n
L \n
"Through tears the rising sun I oft have viewed, \n
Through tears have seen him towards that world descend \n
Where my poor heart lost all its fortitude: \n
Three years a wanderer now my course I bend-- \n
Oh! tell me whither--for no earthly friend \n
Have I."--She ceased, and weeping turned away; \n
As if because her tale was at an end, \n
She wept; because she had no more to say \n
Of that perpetual weight which on her spirit lay. \n
LI \n
True sympathy the Sailor's looks expressed, \n
His looks--for pondering he was mute the while. \n
Of social Order's care for wretchedness, \n
Of Time's sure help to calm and reconcile, \n
Joy's second spring and Hope's long-treasured smile, \n
'Twas not for 'him' to speak--a man so tried, \n
Yet, to relieve her heart, in friendly style \n
Proverbial words of comfort he applied, \n
And not in vain, while they went pacing side by side. \n
LII \n
Ere long, from heaps of turf, before their sight, \n
Together smoking in the sun's slant beam, \n
Rise various wreaths that into one unite \n
Which high and higher mounts with silver gleam: \n
Fair spectacle,---but instantly a scream \n
Thence bursting shrill did all remark prevent; \n
They paused, and heard a hoarser voice blaspheme, \n
And female cries. Their course they thither bent, \n
And met a man who foamed with anger vehement, \n
LIII \n
A woman stood with quivering lips and pale, \n
And, pointing to a little child that lay \n
Stretched on the ground, began a piteous tale; \n
How in a simple freak of thoughtless play \n
He had provoked his father, who straightway, \n
As if each blow were deadlier than the last, \n
Struck the poor innocent. Pallid with dismay \n
The Soldier's Widow heard and stood aghast; \n
And stern looks on the man her grey-haired Comrade cast. \n
LIV \n
His voice with indignation rising high \n
Such further deed in manhood's name forbade; \n
The peasant, wild in passion, made reply \n
With bitter insult and revilings sad; \n
Asked him in scorn what business there he had; \n
What kind of plunder he was hunting now; \n
The gallows would one day of him be glad;-- \n
Though inward anguish damped the Sailor's brow, \n
Yet calm he seemed as thoughts so poignant would allow. \n
LV \n
Softly he stroked the child, who lay outstretched \n
With face to earth; and, as the boy turned round \n
His battered head, a groan the Sailor fetched \n
As if he saw--there and upon that ground-- \n
Strange repetition of the deadly wound \n
He had himself inflicted. Through his brain \n
At once the griding iron passage found; \n
Deluge of tender thoughts then rushed amain, \n
Nor could his sunken eyes the starting tear restrain. \n
LVI \n
Within himself he said--What hearts have we! \n
The blessing this a father gives his child! \n
Yet happy thou, poor boy! compared with me, \n
Suffering not doing ill--fate far more mild. \n
The stranger's looks and tears of wrath beguiled \n
The father, and relenting thoughts awoke; \n
He kissed his son--so all was reconciled. \n
Then, with a voice which inward trouble broke \n
Ere to his lips it came, the Sailor them bespoke. \n
LVII \n
"Bad is the world, and hard is the world's law \n
Even for the man who wears the warmest fleece; \n
Much need have ye that time more closely draw \n
The bond of nature, all unkindness cease, \n
And that among so few there still be peace: \n
Else can ye hope but with such numerous foes \n
Your pains shall ever with your years increase?"-- \n
While from his heart the appropriate lesson flows, \n
A correspondent calm stole gently o'er his woes. \n
LVIII \n
Forthwith the pair passed on; and down they look \n
Into a narrow valley's pleasant scene \n
Where wreaths of vapour tracked a winding brook, \n
That babbled on through groves and meadows green; \n
A low-roofed house peeped out the trees between; \n
The dripping groves resound with cheerful lays, \n
And melancholy lowings intervene \n
Of scattered herds, that in the meadow graze, \n
Some amid lingering shade, some touched by the sun's rays. \n
LIX \n
They saw and heard, and, winding with the road, \n
Down a thick wood, they dropt into the vale; \n
Comfort, by prouder mansions unbestowed, \n
Their wearied frames, she hoped, would soon regale. \n
Erelong they reached that cottage in the dale: \n
It was a rustic inn;--the board was spread, \n
The milk-maid followed with her brimming pail, \n
And lustily the master carved the bread, \n
Kindly the housewife pressed, and they in comfort fed. \n
LX \n
Their breakfast done, the pair, though loth, must part; \n
Wanderers whose course no longer now agrees. \n
She rose and bade farewell! and, while her heart \n
Struggled with tears nor could its sorrow ease, \n
She left him there; for, clustering round his knees, \n
With his oak-staff the cottage children played; \n
And soon she reached a spot o'erhung with trees \n
And banks of ragged earth; beneath the shade \n
Across the pebbly road a little runnel strayed. \n
LXI \n
A cart and horse beside the rivulet stood; \n
Chequering the canvas roof the sunbeams shone. \n
She saw the carman bend to scoop the flood \n
As the wain fronted her,--wherein lay one, \n
A pale-faced Woman, in disease far gone. \n
The carman wet her lips as well behoved; \n
Bed under her lean body there was none, \n
Though even to die near one she most had loved \n
She could not of herself those wasted limbs have moved. \n
LXII \n
The Soldier's Widow learned with honest pain \n
And homefelt force of sympathy sincere, \n
Why thus that worn-out wretch must there sustain \n
The jolting road and morning air severe. \n
The wain pursued its way; and following near \n
In pure compassion she her steps retraced \n
Far as the cottage. "A sad sight is here," \n
She cried aloud; and forth ran out in haste \n
The friends whom she had left but a few minutes past. \n
LXIII \n
While to the door with eager speed they ran, \n
From her bare straw the Woman half upraised \n
Her bony visage--gaunt and deadly wan; \n
No pity asking, on the group she gazed \n
With a dim eye, distracted and amazed; \n
Then sank upon her straw with feeble moan. \n
Fervently cried the housewife--"God be praised, \n
I have a house that I can call my own; \n
Nor shall she perish there, untended and alone!" \n
LXIV \n
So in they bear her to the chimney seat, \n
And busily, though yet with fear, untie \n
Her garments, and, to warm her icy feet \n
And chafe her temples, careful hands apply. \n
Nature reviving, with a deep-drawn sigh \n
She strove, and not in vain, her head to rear; \n
Then said--"I thank you all; if I must die, \n
The God in heaven my prayers for you will hear; \n
Till now I did not think my end had been so near. \n
LXV \n
"Barred every comfort labour could procure, \n
Suffering what no endurance could assuage, \n
I was compelled to seek my father's door, \n
Though loth to be a burthen on his age. \n
But sickness stopped me in an early stage \n
Of my sad journey; and within the wain \n
They placed me--there to end life's pilgrimage, \n
Unless beneath your roof I may remain; \n
For I shall never see my father's door again. \n
LXVI \n
"My life, Heaven knows, hath long been burthensome; \n
But, if I have not meekly suffered, meek \n
May my end be! Soon will this voice be dumb: \n
Should child of mine e'er wander hither, speak \n
Of me, say that the worm is on my cheek.-- \n
Torn from our hut, that stood beside the sea \n
Near Portland lighthouse in a lonesome creek, \n
My husband served in sad captivity \n
On shipboard, bound till peace or death should set him free. \n
LXVII \n
"A sailor's wife I knew a widow's cares, \n
Yet two sweet little ones partook my bed; \n
Hope cheered my dreams, and to my daily prayers \n
Our heavenly Father granted each day's bread; \n
Till one was found by stroke of violence dead, \n
Whose body near our cottage chanced to lie; \n
A dire suspicion drove us from our shed; \n
In vain to find a friendly face we try, \n
Nor could we live together those poor boys and I; \n
LXVIII \n
"For evil tongues made oath how on that day \n
My husband lurked about the neighbourhood; \n
Now he had fled, and whither none could say, \n
And 'he' had done the deed in the dark wood-- \n
Near his own home!--but he was mild and good; \n
Never on earth was gentler creature seen; \n
He'd not have robbed the raven of its food. \n
My husband's lovingkindness stood between \n
Me and all worldly harms and wrongs however keen." \n
LXIX \n
Alas! the thing she told with labouring breath \n
The Sailor knew too well. That wickedness \n
His hand had wrought; and when, in the hour of death, \n
He saw his Wife's lips move his name to bless \n
With her last words, unable to suppress \n
His anguish, with his heart he ceased to strive; \n
And, weeping loud in this extreme distress, \n
He cried--"Do pity me! That thou shouldst live \n
I neither ask nor wish--forgive me, but forgive!" \n
LXX \n
To tell the change that Voice within her wrought \n
Nature by sign or sound made no essay; \n
A sudden joy surprised expiring thought, \n
And every mortal pang dissolved away. \n
Borne gently to a bed, in death she lay; \n
Yet still while over her the husband bent, \n
A look was in her face which seemed to say, \n
"Be blest; by sight of thee from heaven was sent \n
Peace to my parting soul, the fulness of content." \n
LXXI \n
'She' slept in peace,--his pulses throbbed and stopped, \n
Breathless he gazed upon her face,--then took \n
Her hand in his, and raised it, but both dropped, \n
When on his own he cast a rueful look. \n
His ears were never silent; sleep forsook \n
His burning eyelids stretched and stiff as lead; \n
All night from time to time under him shook \n
The floor as he lay shuddering on his bed; \n
And oft he groaned aloud, "O God, that I were dead!" \n
LXXII \n
The Soldier's Widow lingered in the cot, \n
And, when he rose, he thanked her pious care \n
Through which his Wife, to that kind shelter brought, \n
Died in his arms; and with those thanks a prayer \n
He breathed for her, and for that merciful pair. \n
The corse interred, not one hour heremained \n
Beneath their roof, but to the open air \n
A burthen, now with fortitude sustained, \n
He bore within a breast where dreadful quiet reigned. \n
LXXIII \n
Confirmed of purpose, fearlessly prepared \n
For act and suffering, to the city straight \n
He journeyed, and forthwith his crime declared: \n
"And from your doom," he added, "now I wait, \n
Nor let it linger long, the murderer's fate." \n
Not ineffectual was that piteous claim: \n
"O welcome sentence which will end though late," \n
He said, "the pangs that to my conscience came \n
Out of that deed. My trust, Saviour! is in thy name!" \n
LXXIV \n
His fate was pitied. Him in iron case \n
(Reader, forgive the intolerable thought) \n
They hung not:--no one on 'his' form or face \n
Could gaze, as on a show by idlers sought; \n
No kindred sufferer, to his death-place brought \n
By lawless curiosity or chance, \n
When into storm the evening sky is wrought, \n
Upon his swinging corse an eye can glance, \n
And drop, as he once dropped, in miserable trance. \n<|endoftext|>

Together they stay for life long \n
Together they walk and stand and sleep \n
Together they play, sing and weep \n
Together they stay for life long \n

and if they ever separate \n
they make the world a bad place \n

A day of sorrow, \n
a day of pain, \n
Not knowing who's to blame? \n
Towers standing tall and true, \n
Destroyed by people with something to prove. \n
Millions cried and millions prayed, \n
To save one life the heroes slaved. \n
Clearing the rubble and mounds of debris, \n
With tears in their eyes, they worked fearlessly. \n
Stranges wept for the many and few, \n
Hoping God will pull them throught. \n
I walk throught the valley of the shadow of death; \n
The last words spoken before we laid them to rest. \n
I cry with people I do not know, \n
To see their pain it hurts me so. \n
Maybe one day our pain will end, \n
With love and support from family and friends. \n<|endoftext|>

Sorrow like a ceaseless rain \n
Beats upon my heart. \n
People twist and scream in pain,— \n

This has neither wax nor wane, \n
Neither stop nor start. \n
People dress and go to town; \n

Standing up or sitting down \n
Little matters, or what gown \n
Or what shoes I wear. \n<|endoftext|>

Having failed miserably, \n

a time to think, on things that last; \n
on family, friends and things that matter, \n
on things that endure and do not scattter. \n
A time to laugh and a time to weep, \n
a time for treasured things to keep; \n
a time for reflection on how we feel, \n
a time to mend and a time to heal. \n
A time to live and a time to die, \n
a time for joy and a time to cry; \n
a time to smile and a time for tears, \n
a time for God to calm our fears. \n
A time to despose of loved ones dead, \n
A time to get on with the day ahead; \n
To blot out death and face the 'morrow, \n
To clear the mind and bury sorrow. \n<|endoftext|>

Where life barely exists \n
And sound of rain is lost in ocean of sand \n
Where life pass, years! Seeking the skies \n
Waiting for watery drop \n
Even like a tear that dropp from my eye \n
Its not a sorrow of a princess \n
Whose love is apart \n
Her affection grows everyday \n
But she cannot express her heart \n
Its not agony of a woman \n
Whose man is on way to disaster \n
Nor pain of mother \n
Whose son made devil his master \n
Its not wail of a child \n
Whose dreams are broken like stars \n
Nor pain of those \n
Whose friends are dying in wars \n
Its nota lament after tempest \n

Tear in my eyes \n
Is due to my inner sorrow \n
For the world I live in is crying dying \n
And am I not to grieve over something which is mine? \n

sorrow \n
Can little sweetness be added to sorrow? \n
Can sadness be not pushed aside for tomorrow? \n
When both are interwoven to each other \n
Why to think of them more and bother? \n
Pure or true love can never deceive \n
Warmth and feelings we always receive \n
Best ideas emanate from within and peace be conceived \n
Does that speak of real intention as goal is perceived? \n
Let love speak and not remain or confine within \n
Eyes must reveal and nothing should remain in \n
It is very much essential and must prevail at last \n
Acceptance should be made known very fast \n
I must acknowledge it as God sent gift \n
Why to have in life more tussles and rift? \n
We should never change stand and shift \n
Switch over from one to another should be very swift \n
I am prepared to forgo prestige and pride \n
Why in love it should be sought and hide? \n
Simple admission of true feelings and no guilt \n
Trust the opinion and strong foundation to be built \n
I shall seek no favor in return \n
Let my love grow and cause no concern \n
Earnest desire must be explained in turn \n
Let there be real union without any heart burn \n
May be in my life today is the happiest day \n
I will continue to seek and have my way \n
Let her remain true to her conscience and say \n
Never will we be separated, come what may! \n
Things may prove difficult if it turns out differently \n
Both have to think it honestly and approach separately \n
Time may run out us and not allow us to unite \n
Passion may remain passion only and within ignite \n
We may take steps to see that it doesn’t turn ugly \n
It may be too early also to forecast it so early \n
Still it will remain our top priority to tackle the issue \n
We must get in turn what ever is destined to be due \n
We will not be cowed down with by unexpected events \n
We will face it bravely when it is made known very next moment \n
We will not allow it to happen and take us completely by surprise \n
But all possibilities are definitely there and bound to arise \n
We shall from now on shed no tears and face the reality \n
We shall stand firm and come up bravely for any eventuality \n
It has to be faced with as if dealing with any of the disaster \n
We must carve out the way and destiny as done by master \n<|endoftext|>
sorrow \n
Challenges in life, The ups and downs, \n
It’s all part of life, both smiles and frowns, \n
Like a Ferris wheel, you’re up then down. \n
You wish to hide, or maybe leave town, \n
Reality is real; we all face the fear, \n
We smile with joy; we all shed a tear, \n
Life can be lonely, when no one is near, \n
We often think, we’re not welcome here. \n
The sorrow we feel, that others can’t see, \n
A desire for help, we wish to plea, \n
A sense of loneliness, A desire to flee, \n
You’re not alone, both you and me, \n
Friends are waiting, with the comfort we need, \n
They are waiting; their hearts also bleed, \n
One small gesture, just one small seed, \n
Is all that’s required, for a friend to proceed, \n
To listen and comfort, for someone like you, \n
They want to help. They have been there too, \n
We’re not by ourselves, when life is so blue, \n
Someone can help, with the pain we go through, \n<|endoftext|>

T'was full of melancholy pure. \n
I sat and listened for what seemed to be forever, \n
It seemed to be joy's cure. \n
Never again can you think the same, \n
Once you've heard such a song. \n
Never again can you live the same, \n
Once you know what's truly right and wrong. \n
I fell into pieces, \n
I lost all my hope. \n
I whithered away, \n
There was no way to cope. \n

Love is the most beautiful thing alive.. \n
You might not think its alive, but it is. \n
Love is a living parasite who can make huge changes in their victim. \n
To notice infection you feel it, for example if your heart feels like clouds \n
and if your feets feel like they want to take air. \n
Love is known for its wonderful gift of corrupting humans. \n
It colour is red and blue. Soft colours that makes you calm. \n
There is no cure but as it is alive it also dies. \n<|endoftext|>

animal \n
A was an elegant Ape \n
Who tied up his ears with red tape, \n
And wore a long veil \n
Half revealing his tail \n
Which was trimmed with jet bugles and crape. \n
B was a boastful old Bear \n
Who used to say,--'Hoomh! I declare \n
I can eat--if you'll get me \n
The children, and let me-- \n
Ten babies, teeth, toenails and hair!' \n
C was a Codfish who sighed \n
When snatched from the home of his pride, \n
But could he, embrined, \n
Guess this fragrance behind, \n
How glad he would be that he died! \n
D was a dandified Dog \n
Who said,--'Though it's raining like fog \n
I wear no umbrellah, \n
Me boy, for a fellah \n
Might just as well travel incog!' \n
E was an elderly Eel \n
Who would say,--'Well, I really feel-- \n
As my grandchildren wriggle \n
And shout 'I should giggle'-- \n
A trifle run down at the heel!' \n
F was a Fowl who conceded \n
_Some_ hens might hatch more eggs than _she_ did,-- \n
But she'd children as plenty \n
As eighteen or twenty, \n
And that was quite all that she needed. \n
G was a gluttonous Goat \n
Who, dining one day, _table-d'hote,_ \n
Ordered soup-bone, _au fait_, \n
And fish, _papier-mache_, \n
And a _filet_ of Spring overcoat. \n
H was a high-cultured Hound \n
Who could clear forty feet at a bound, \n
And a coon once averred \n
That his howl could be heard \n
For five miles and three-quarters around. \n
I was an Ibex ambitious \n
To dive over chasms auspicious; \n
He would leap down a peak \n
And not light for a week, \n
And swear that the jump was delicious. \n
J was a Jackass who said \n
He had such a bad cold in his head, \n
If it wasn't for leaving \n
The rest of us grieving, \n
He'd really rather be dead. \n
K was a profligate Kite \n
Who would haunt the saloons every night; \n
And often he ust \n
To reel back to his roost \n
Too full to set up on it right. \n
L was a wary old Lynx \n
Who would say,--'Do you know wot I thinks?-- \n
I thinks ef you happen \n
To ketch me a-nappin' \n
I'm ready to set up the drinks!' \n
M was a merry old Mole, \n
Who would snooze all the day in his hole, \n
Then--all night, a-rootin' \n
Around and galootin'-- \n
He'd sing 'Johnny, Fill up the Bowl!' \n
N was a caustical Nautilus \n
Who sneered, 'I suppose, when they've _caught_ all us, \n
Like oysters they'll serve us, \n
And can us, preserve us, \n
And barrel, and pickle, and bottle us!' \n
O was an autocrat Owl-- \n
Such a wise--such a wonderful fowl! \n
Why, for all the night through \n
He would hoot and hoo-hoo, \n
And hoot and hoo-hooter and howl! \n
P was a Pelican pet, \n
Who gobbled up all he could get; \n
He could eat on until \n
He was full to the bill, \n
And there he had lodgings to let! \n
Q was a querulous Quail, \n
Who said: 'It will little avail \n
The efforts of those \n
Of my foes who propose \n
To attempt to put salt on my tail!' \n
R was a ring-tailed Raccoon, \n
With eyes of the tinge of the moon, \n
And his nose a blue-black, \n
And the fur on his back \n
A sad sort of sallow maroon. \n
S is a Sculpin--you'll wish \n
Very much to have one on your dish, \n
Since all his bones grow \n
On the outside, and so \n
He's a very desirable fish. \n
T was a Turtle, of wealth, \n
Who went round with particular stealth,-- \n
'Why,' said he, 'I'm afraid \n
Of being waylaid \n
When I even walk out for my health!' \n
U was a Unicorn curious, \n
With one horn, of a growth so _luxurious_, \n
He could level and stab it-- \n
If you didn't grab it-- \n
Clean through you, he was so blamed furious! \n
V was a vagabond Vulture \n
Who said: 'I don't want to insult yer, \n
But when you intrude \n
Where in lone solitude \n
I'm a-preyin', you're no man o' culture!' \n
W was a wild _Wood_chuck, \n
And you can just bet that he _could_ 'chuck' \n
He'd eat raw potatoes, \n
Green corn, and tomatoes, \n
And tree roots, and call it all '_good_ chuck!' \n
X was a kind of X-cuse \n
Of a some-sort-o'-thing that got loose \n
Before we could name it, \n
And cage it, and tame it, \n
And bring it in general use. \n
Y is the Yellowbird,--bright \n
As a petrified lump of star-light, \n
Or a handful of lightning- \n
Bugs, squeezed in the tight'ning \n
Pink fist of a boy, at night. \n
Z is the Zebra, of course!-- \n
A kind of a clown-of-a-horse,-- \n
Each other despising, \n
Yet neither devising \n
A way to obtain a divorce! \n
& here is the famous--what-is-it? \n
Walk up, Master Billy, and quiz it: \n
You've seen the _rest_ of 'em-- \n
Ain't this the _best_ of 'em, \n
Right at the end of your visit? \n<|endoftext|>
animal \n
Like the easily startled deer, \n
A horse is prone to fear. \n
Millennia of being prey, \n
Has built an instinct to run away. \n
I'm sure you can understand, \n
That courage and fear go hand in hand. \n
In 2011, Tonk the stallion, \n
Was worthy of a medallion. \n
He ignored the call to flight, \n
And chose to stay and fight, \n
When a 700 pound grizzly bear, \n
Appeared out of thin air, \n
And chased an 8 year old boy, \n
His father's pride and joy. \n
Tonk's rider was Erin Bolster, \n
She had no weapon or holster. \n
Her last name means 'to support', \n
But you never would have thought, \n
She'd look the bear in the eye, \n
And let out a valiant cry, \n
"I'll not stand by, \n
And watch this boy die! " \n
Now Tonk was 18 hands in height, \n
An angel dressed in white. \n
He chose to stay and fight, \n
When other horses took flight. \n
Three times this brave pair, \n
Charged headlong at the bear, \n
Staring into his fearsome face, \n
Until at last he left the place. \n
Afterwards Tonk could not stop shaking, \n
He'd been so close to breaking. \n
Those scary looking jaws, \n
And mighty sharp claws, \n
Had made him so upset, \n
His coat was drenched with sweat. \n
So the bravest animal I know, \n
Is similar to a nervous doe, \n
It's a white Percheron draft horse, \n
Called Tonk of course! \n
David Letterman let the world know, \n
When our heroes appeared on his show. \n
This gentle giant made so many smile, \n
And forget their worries for quite a while. \n<|endoftext|>

Poets are imagery animals \n
Wait for thoughts arrival \n
Think a lot and then write \n
Use head more to ignite \n

But normally they are quiet \n
Allow things to let \n

Now millions come up like flowers \n
Even without rainy showers \n
They are product of fast age \n
Not much to impress with each page \n
One in million stars is praised \n

Poets are known as star family \n
Twinkle little in their own capacity \n
Not all may be able to speak with authority \n
Some may define imagery love and some may praise almighty \n
Some may put with all the times to remember and some with variety \n
It is all about poets tenure and may not be remembered like deity \n
It is their job to create pure imagination \n
Sometimes to be painted with correct relation \n
Not all the incidences pure images \n

Domesticated some of the animals from wild \n

We used them for travel, war, and milking \n
For its skins to make ourselves comfort. \n
Denied justice in its negative health \n
Even killed without hesitation at all \n
Animals are also bound to get justice \n
In this world of injustice sometimes. \n
Slowly and sluggishly humans accepts \n
They makes schemes for their protection \n
But still the road is far away to reach \n

It requires little restrain to act \n
It is good to have appetite for knowledge \n
It may then give enough time for leverage \n
With dedication and efforts it can give result \n
Only inner urge should be controlled and remain well built \n

Code Orange Code Red, today these warnings echo throughout our land, \n
But these warnings just focus our attention on the wickedness of man. \n
Look and see how we have let sin and immorality prosper in our land, \n
Should we not be more concerned about God's Righteous Uplifted Hand? \n
The fears from wars and rumors of wars are simply a sign of the end, \n
However, the extent of man's wickedness is indeed limited my friend. \n
Why have such fears of man who can only kill the body but do no more? \n
And fear not The Lord who can assign you to Eternal Hell forevermore. \n
Man continues to kill because of his depraved heart filled with sin, \n
But God must judge wickedness, because of His Righteousness within. \n
My friend, if you just humble your heart and fear God instead of man, \n
Through His Spirit He will open your eyes to His Loving Eternal Plan. \n
God's Will is for all to come to repentance and through Him be saved, \n
However, God must still judge those who remain wicked and depraved. \n
You can continue to fear man and have your heart filled with strife, \n
Or repent and accept Christ in your heart, and receive Eternal Life. \n
I don't fear any man, for at death I shall be present with The Lord, \n
With no fear of God, you'll live without Him, this you can't afford. \n
Life on this earth is quite brief, while Eternal Life is quite long, \n
So don't continue fearing man, only to find out you were wrong. \n

It is not for them to criticize too minutely the methods the Irish followed, though they might deplore some of their results. During the past few years Ireland had been going through what was tantamount to a revolution. -- EARL SPENCER \n
Red Earl, and will ye take for guide \n
The silly camel-birds, \n
That ye bury your head in an Irish thorn, \n
On a desert of drifting words? \n
Ye have followed a man for a God, Red Earl, \n
As the Lord o' Wrong and Right; \n
But the day is done with the setting sun \n
Will ye follow into the night? \n
He gave you your own old words, Red Earl, \n
For food on the wastrel way; \n
Will ye rise and eat in the night, Red Earl, \n
That fed so full in the day? \n
Ye have followed fast, ye have followed far, \n
And where did the wandering lead? \n
From the day that ye praised the spoken word \n
To the day ye must gloss the deed. \n
And as ye have given your hand for gain, \n
So must ye give in loss; \n
And as ye ha' come to the brink of the pit, \n
So must ye loup across. \n
For some be rogues in grain, Red Earl, \n
And some be rogues in fact, \n
And rogues direct and rogues elect; \n
But all be rogues in pact. \n
Ye have cast your lot with these, Red Earl; \n
Take heed to where ye stand. \n
Ye have tied a knot with your tongue, Red Earl, \n
That ye cannot loose with your hand. \n
Ye have travelled fast, ye have travelled far, \n
In the grip of a tightening tether, \n
Till ye find at the end ye must take for friend \n
The quick and their dead together. \n
Ye have played with the Law between your lips, \n
And mouthed it daintilee; \n
But the gist o' the speech is ill to teach, \n
For ye say: "Let wrong go free." \n
Red Earl, ye wear the Garter fair, \n
And gat your place from a King: \n
Do ye make Rebellion of no account, \n
And Treason a little thing? \n
And have ye weighed your words, Red Earl, \n
That stand and speak so high? \n
And is it good that the guilt o' blood, \n
Be cleared at the cost of a sigh? \n
And is it well for the sake of peace, \n
Our tattered Honour to sell, \n
And higgle anew with a tainted crew -- \n
Red Earl, and is it well? \n
Ye have followed fast, ye have followed far, \n
On a dark and doubtful way, \n
And the road is hard, is hard, Red Earl, \n
And the price is yet to pay. \n
Ye shall pay that price as ye reap reward \n
For the toil of your tongue and pen -- \n
In the praise of the blamed and the thanks of the shamed, \n
And the honour o' knavish men. \n
They scarce shall veil their scorn, Red Earl, \n
And the worst at the last shall be, \n
When you tell your heart that it does not know \n
And your eye that it does not see. \n<|endoftext|>

Red is believing, and then having doubt. \n
Red reeks of revenge, of suffering and hate. \n
Red is being thirsty and having to wait. \n
Red, in a painting, makes one hot and confused, \n
It’s the anger of crying when you feel you’ve been used. \n
Red is that voice, deep in your head, \n
It could keep you back, but pushes ahead. \n
It mocks you silently with a voice full of hate, \n
“You can’t do it, you are weak, and it is your fate.” \n
Red feels like fire, singeing your heart, \n
It’s wanting to be together, but having to part. \n
Red is running through desert and sun, \n
It’s needing a friend, but having none. \n
Red is the heart that’s been broken in two, \n
It’s hearing those lies, and wanting what’s true. \n<|endoftext|>

Red Cliff where General Zhou Yu won his early fame \n
When the Three Kingdoms were in flame. \n

With piled-up rocks to stab the sky \n
And waves to shake them thunderously \n
Churning the frothy mass to mounds of snow, \n

Those ages hide how many a hero! \n
Think back to those old days; \n
that first year when Zhou Yu had just married the Young Qiao. \n

While masts and oars were blotted out in smoke and flame! \n
My wits that stray to realms of old \n
Deserve the scorn of all who feel; \n
Years pass, and hair grows white so soon. \n

One toast continues still -- the River and the Moon! \n<|endoftext|>
red \n
I sit alone, it's all too much, \n
Why can't i just be dead, \n
I need to free the hurt inside, \n
So I cry my tears of red. \n
I watch the blood flow thick and fast, \n
As I cut deeper every day, \n
I open up my body, \n
To bleed my pain away \n
My body is engraved, \n
With the emotions of my heart, \n
My skin's the story of my soul, \n
I'm a living work of art. \n
The words read red and clear, \n
As more blood starts to flow, \n
I'm holding on to life right now, \n
But soon I'll let it go. \n
What have I got to live for, \n
But to hack into my skin? \n
Soon I'll make that final cut, \n
And end all that's within. \n

I \n
Viola, I'm the galloping horse in a battle, \n
The trumpeting elephant in a tide, \n
The growling tiger ready to collide. \n
I'm in the hail storm of an acid rain, \n
the roaring lion sets to die in a fire. \n
Lo, fighting is my Label, a rebel red; \n
In trouble as I fell with a rhyme triple. \n
Rulers have the power just to fire, yet \n
I'm the counter fire, I never retire, but \n
I died in a foul encounter, a mystery. \n
For pollution in their hearts I'm the solution; \n
Hello! My name is revolution, \n
The thunder bolt and the wonder volt! \n
From here does mutiny spreads….. \n
I'm a rebellion dead as the blood I wed. \n
As a child I didn't play on the saar, so what? \n
War is not far, my mouth if I open. Tut! \n
Know not Mozilla yet I mastered warfare guerrilla, \n
Can't sneak like a thief nor slither like a snake, \n
But I tone a slogan, ‘hike-hike my life is at stake.' \n
II \n
Hello-hello fellow class, I did not pass, \n
In the mass I'm one, let me sing for the poor. \n
Stalin, Lenin, Mao and Chou are my bosses, \n
Gun is my friend, pen is my property and \n
I will fight and fight till I create history. \n
I'm the dying spirit of my fellow comrades, \n
A lover of swords and words of Karl Marx. \n
In the deep woods dark, blood I spill. \n
For reasons known and in seasons myriad \n
To change the society into selfless one. \n
I'm the exponent - a Marxist, Maoist and Titoist; \n
The proponent - a Castroist, Guevarist and Trotskyist; \n
The revolutionist - an extremist, radicalist and sydicalist. \n
Quit using spade bit - a bolshie, commie and naxalite \n
as a Leftist, a communist yet the A-one humanist am I. \n
Come, come comrade, oh crimson colored commie! \n
Cheers, do you hear a boisterous welcome? Yo, red - \n
To, tovarish, with gazillion cockades red, a bonvoyage. \n
Heaven and earth you moved so let me bid you adieu; \n
keep chanting - salaam, salaam comrade, lal salaam! \n<|endoftext|>

If the world was crazy, you know what I'd eat? \n
A big slice of soup and a whole quart of meat, \n
A lemonade sandwich, and then I might try \n
Some roasted ice cream or a bicycle pie, \n
A nice notebook salad, and underwear roast, \n
An omelet of hats and some crisp cardboard toast, \n
A thick malted milk made from pencils and daisies, \n
And that's what I'd eat if the world was crazy. \n
If the world was crazy, you know what I'd wear? \n
A chocolate suit and a tie of eclair, \n
Some marshmallow earmuffs, some licorice shoes, \n
And I'd read a paper of peppermint news. \n
I'd call the boys 'Suzy' and I'd call the girls 'Harry,' \n
I'd talk through my ears, and I always would carry \n
A paper unbrella for when it grew hazy \n
To keep in the rain, if the world was crazy. \n
If the world was crazy, you know what I'd do? \n
I'd walk on the ocean and swim in my shoe, \n

When I met somebody I'd say 'G'bye, Joe,' \n
And when I was leaving - then I'd say 'Hello.' \n

Call me crazy, \n
But I’m beginning to think that maybe, \n
Maybe she was right. \n
Perhaps it’s time for you to take flight, \n
Leave me sitting here, cursed, \n
So you can be with the friend who comes first. \n
I defended you, said you were a friend, \n
But I think it’s time for those words to come to an end. \n
I once heard: “Love many, trust few” \n
I thought I trusted you, but now I see that this friendship isn’t true. \n
I waved to you and said “Hi, ” \n
Now I’m waving, but this time saying “Bye.” \n
Soon, I’ll cry and make a big deal, \n
I’ll cry, but I’ll keep this promise sealed. \n
Just like Taylor said, “I can’t breath without you, \n
But I have too.” \n
It’s beginning to get cold \n
It feels like, to you, my heart’s been sold. \n
I go sit on the cold ground out side, \n
And abide for you to choose your side. \n
Have you ever thought that maybe, your wrong, not me? \n
Perhaps that’s the key. \n
Now you can say you’re sorry all you want, \n
But know she was right again, you’re not. \n
You’re not Sorry. \n<|endoftext|>

I wrote this poem when a girl at my school got beaten up by other girls after daring to go for a night out to another village near her own. \n
I left the house looking for fun \n
My mum shouted out 'Don't be long.' \n
I'd suffered before, \n
Echoes in my head: \n
'You don't belong! ! you don't belong.! ! ' \n
Love and Hate, do they equate? \n
I sat on the form, doing the norm: \n
drinking cider and beer, \n
unleashing the fear. \n
Love and Hate, Love and Hate. \n
Then they arrived, full of pride, \n
Crazy eyes, \n
Chanting ' You don't belong! ! you don't belong! ! ' \n
I tried to negate, \n
I could taste their hate. \n
'You don't belong, you don't belong.' \n
The boots went in, \n
Head started to spin, \n
'You don't belong, you don't belong.' \n
When I awoke mum was there, \n
Full of despair, \n
All she said 'I told you don't be long.' \n
Love and Hate, do they equate? \n
'Don't be long.' 'You Don't belong.' \n<|endoftext|>

For when we open up, ours mouths \n
sometimes the words we say, \n
just come out all wrong. \n
A Scottish friend of my wife \n
went to see the Doctor \n
as her pregnancy was over due. \n
The Doctor told her \n
he would give it another week \n
and then he would have to induce her. \n
When she went, home \n
and her husband asked how it went. \n
What she said next must \n
have come as a big surprise. \n
The Doctor said if I haven’t had it \n
in another week, \n
he was going to seduce me. \n
Another friend of Vera’s \n
went to the Doctor one day. \n
He asked, have you come on your cycle? \n
She quickly replied, \n
no my husband brought me in his car. \n
Vera must be learning from them. \n
When we were engaged, \n
my mother gave her \n
a large bunch of peonies. \n
She went to work the next day \n
and told all her friends about the flowers. \n
She then wondered why \n
they were curled up with laughter. \n
She told them about the flowers OK, \n
but her tongue couldn’t get a grip on peonies \n
and something else came out instead. \n
What a crazy world we live in \n
and I wouldn’t change it in anyway. \n

Sometimes i feel like im left out, \n

sometimes \n
Sometimes when the days and nights that separate us \n
Stretch out, an endless void \n
When the distance becomes torturous \n
The ache, unbearably real \n
And the embrace of cold air \n
Cuts deeper than a knife \n
I begin to wonder how will I get through \n
This day, this week, this month without you \n
Why do our souls entwine wondrously, \n
When we can’t meet \n
Why do our bodies yearn so longingly, \n
When the simplest touch is denied \n
Yes ours is a bonding of souls \n
In this life, our bodies far removed \n
But in every life, we will seek each other \n
Ceaselessly journeying together \n
On this path, with petals strewn over stones \n
Finding love, as the light grows. \n<|endoftext|>
sometimes \n
He is tired \n
of Life. \n
Comes in after a hard day's work... \n
...lights a long tipped French cigarette. \n
Takes a long slow drag. \n
Takes a quick sip \n
of an Australian Chardonnay. \n
Switches on(by remote) \n
the Abba DVD \n
sings along to; KNOWING ME...KNOWING YOU. \n
He likes to do \n
the 'Ahhhh...ha! ' bits. \n
The two guys look like \n
trolls...it's the girls \n
he admires. \n
Fancies Agnetha first then \n
fancies he fancies Anfrid too. \n
Surfs the net. \n
Deletes the junk mail. \n
Would like to kill 'em all. \n
He sharpens his scythe \n
wishes someone \n
would updat the symbolic tools. \n
He feels such \n
a fool \n
carting it about \n
& black \n
...was never his colour. \n
'Come to bed, love! ' \n
calls out Mrs. Death \n
(eager to jump on his bones) \n
Death hangs \n
his scythe up. \n
Grins that deathless grin \n
that makes her \n
shiver all over. \n
Death smiles: \n
'Coming love...coming! ' \n<|endoftext|>
sometimes \n
Sometimes there are no words to say \n
why a heart should feel this way. \n
No reason to even question why \n
Just be still, don't even try. \n
Sometimes thinking holds no thought \n
Life's just a net in which we're caught \n
No use in struggling to be free \n
We cannot plan our destiny \n
Sometimes we just have to listen \n
and just go by our intuition \n
No need to try and justify \n
A love we simply can't deny \n<|endoftext|>
sometimes \n
truth has a face \n
with many expressions \n
truth can hurt you in ways you can't imagine \n
truth can make you happy or sad \n
depending on the situation you had \n
truth can kill you or even save you \n
truth can help you or even break you \n
what if today your parents decide \n
to tell you \n
when you were a baby \n
you were adopted \n
after 18 years \n

sometimes \n
what is right can sometimes be wrong, \n
like the right of a state to kill, \n
that to me is wrong, \n
like the right to have slaves \n
that was wrong, but they once \n
thought it was right, \n
something that feels so right \n
may, sometimes, be also be wrong, \n
like feeling love, and too much love \n
for a neighbor or yourself, \n
it can be intoxicating at times, \n
and it can kill you, \n
because what is right exists only \n
in our human minds, \n
limited, too narrow, too \n
confined in our flesh and blood, \n
in the context of our culture, \n
in the frames of our time, \n
to the dictates of religion \n
the liberality of our education, \n
to our biases and prejudices, \n
what we believe in, what we \n
touch with faith in dark places \n
what we try to light with candles, \n
or see in microscopes or see in \n
telescopes, or see with our eyes \n
and hearts wide open, \n
may still be wrong, or \n
still be not right, \n
so what is right after all? \n
Possibly, this can be right, \n
But possibly this can also be wrong, \n
We can always pray. But the doubt \n
Is always there. Cogito ergo sum. \n
Who can really be sure? \n<|endoftext|>
sometimes \n
Sometimes the skies of tomorrow look bright \n
crystal blue and full of hope \n
telling you the best is on its way.. \n
Sometimes the waters of yesterday seem black \n
showing nothing but the pain you've felt \n
the tears you've cried; the sorrow you're forced to hide.. \n
Sometimes the world of Today seems revealing \n
granting you a moment of peace before you take your next step \n
allowing you for just this one heartbeat to let go. \n<|endoftext|>

sometimes you may forget \n
sometimes people may forget \n
how nuture have a power \n

it have shine from long time ago \n
to show the ancient where to go \n

sometimes \n
sometimes when we emote that much \n
like some bleeding hearts \n
blinded by \n
the colors of the blood and sweat \n
of the dying sun \n
we fail to see \n
that the day has ended \n
that it is time to sleep \n
and dream \n
that it is time to give way \n
for other souls to \n
cry to weep to sigh \n
that it is time for some \n
other creatures who died \n
when they were once \n
children \n
to play their forgotten games \n
in the dark \n
sometimes we must accept \n
this is not just ours \n
this is also theirs \n
and the tears that dry \n
on the sand may not be just \n
ours after all \n
we may meet them \n
in due time, but for now let me \n
meet myself, let me drink with it \n
let me know his name \n
we are still strangers of the \n
very shining light. \n<|endoftext|>
sometimes \n
How could I be so stupid? \n
To not see this coming \n
To not believe the people around me \n
He showed me the world \n
But I paid the price for falling in love \n
He was the school hottie and I was just the new girl \n
He smiled a danger smile \n
I just smiled a sly smile \n
When he first talked to me it was love at first sight \n
Until the day he snapped \n
He grabbed me by my waist chain when he saw me with Jonathan \n
When I got home there was a welt on my waist \n
He apologized over and over the next day and I forgave him \n
But it never changed how he treated me \n
People would see the bruises on me but I always had an excuse to protect him \n
Until the day he came up with a new way to “punish” me \n
He would bite me \n
Leaving marks on my arms and neck \n
That’s when my friend decided enough was enough \n
It was hard seeing him being dragged away \n
To see the only one you ever loved being dragged away from your life \n
I still love him no matter what he did \n
The scares are starting to go away \n
But the way he treated me and the way he so wrongly yelled \n
YOU WILL PAY FOR RATTING YOU STUPID B**** \n
Will never leave my head \n
Even after all of this I still LOVE HIM \n<|endoftext|>
sometimes \n
Sometimes I feel alive, \n
Sometimes I feel dead, \n
Sometimes my heart aches, \n
Sometimes it’s all in my head. \n
Sometimes I feel lonely, \n
Sometimes I need my space, \n
Sometimes nothing happens, \n
Sometimes I’ve too much to face. \n
Sometimes things go right, \n
Sometimes things go wrong, \n
Sometimes I fit right it, \n
Sometimes I just don’t belong. \n
Sometimes I make decisions, \n
Sometimes I’m told what to do, \n
Sometimes I find life hard, \n
Sometimes so do you. \n<|endoftext|>
sometimes \n
Sometimes I feel my life’s just a big nightmare \n
Sometimes I wish I could stand up to my greatest fear \n
Sometimes I wish it all were new \n
Sometimes I wish it were happening to you \n
Sometimes I wish people could only see \n
Another side of me \n
Sometimes I wish I were never born \n
So I wouldn’t be here for you to scorn \n
Sometimes I wonder why I’m only a friend \n
Sometimes I wonder will anyone care if my life came to an end \n
Sometimes I wish you were in my shoes, \n
So you could see life from my point of view \n
Sometimes I wonder if I'm just too late \n
Sometimes I wonder if there’s such a thing as “Fate” \n
Sometimes I wonder why there’s night and day \n
Sometimes I wonder why my life’s this way \n
Sometimes I wish I could jump the track \n
Sometimes I wish I could just go back \n
Sometimes I wish I had a risk worth the take \n
Sometimes I wish I could erase every mistake \n
Sometimes I pretend everything is fine \n
Sometimes I wish I was on the frontline \n
Sometimes I wish life would turn out right \n
Sometimes I wish I could win the fight \n
But nothing is right and nothing is fine \n
So I stand-alone and wait for the end of time, \n
If you wish to join me go ahead \n
Cause in the end we’ll all be dead. \n<|endoftext|>
sometimes \n
Sometimes the sky's too bright, \n
Or has too many clouds or birds, \n
And far away's too sharp a sun \n
To nourish thinking of him. \n
Why is my hand too blunt \n
To cut in front of me \n
My horrid images for me, \n
Of over-fruitful smiles, \n
The weightless touching of the lip \n
I wish to know \n
I cannot lift, but can, \n
The creature with the angel's face \n
Who tells me hurt, \n
And sees my body go \n
Down into misery? \n
No stopping. Put the smile \n
Where tears have come to dry. \n
The angel's hurt is left; \n
His telling burns. \n
Sometimes a woman's heart has salt, \n
Or too much blood; \n
I tear her breast, \n
And see the blood is mine, \n
Flowing from her, but mine, \n
And then I think \n
Perhaps the sky's too bright; \n
And watch my hand, \n
But do not follow it, \n
And feel the pain it gives, \n
But do not ache. \n<|endoftext|>
sometimes \n
Sometimes I wonder, \n
Will I come through? \n
Can I make it to the other side? \n
And also, will you? \n
As I walk through the rain, \n
I can count on a few, \n
And when sometimes they leave me, \n
I wonder, should I pursue? \n
God didn’t promise, \n
As I walk through this life, \n
Skies without clouds, \n
Or storm without quiet. \n
Maybe someday, I’ll understand, \n
When I’m coming up to \n
The end of this land. \n
The day is approaching, \n
I know the time is near, \n
When the end of all things \n
Will end all things here. \n
Asking myself this, \n
What still will be left? \n
Can all this nothingness, \n
And this worldly mindset, \n
Be pleasing to the one, \n
Who made the sun rise and set? \n
Why do they taunt? \n
And say, “You are wrong”? \n
When my king is coming and theirs \n
Lies underground. \n
Mine conquered death, \n
Theirs only died, \n
Mine lives again \n
Theirs, death has tied. \n
My silent prayer, \n
Comes from the heart, \n
Lord save these people, \n
And can I be a part? \n
Be a part of your plan, \n
To change many hearts, \n
For the kingdom that lasts, \n
Has neither end nor start. \n
And as you also \n
Walk through the storm, \n
Remember what it’s about, \n
Who you are living for. \n
Not for this world, \n
Nor mans empty gain, \n
You are living for him, \n
Who restored your soul again. \n<|endoftext|>
sometimes \n
There he sits, \n
Listening and talking \n
About things I neither care for \n
Or make any attempt \n
to pay attention to. \n
Referencing his business methodology, \n
he congratulates himself at \n
the skills he has so cleverly defined. \n
I yawn \n
And attempt to stay awake. \n
8 months down I think, \n
4 to go. \n
Hang in there, David. \n
There they sit \n
Conference call \n
After conference call \n
Making plans about nothing \n
Ado \n
To do \n
To done \n
To did \n
To never did at all. \n
And I wag my finger \n
Because here I sit, \n
Attempting to stay awake \n
so to grasp \n
the chain \n
that I once called a dream. \n
Here we sit, \n
Revolving doors \n
And pushup chairs \n
Swiveling \n
Swilling \n
Swatting \n
Sw earing \n
And missing out, \n
Oh how we miss out. \n
Because all we know \n
Is that while we sit, \n
And we talk, \n
Feigning importance \n
And shuffling ideas \n
Of roads \n
upon rows; \n
we find castles, \n
That lead to nowhere. \n
And \n
There I sit, \n
one kind, \n
of a kind, \n
of empty little road, \n
Driven by \n
headless horsemen carriages. \n
No dreams \n
Just a 401k, \n
a stall, \n
And detail men. \n
But still I sit \n
Somewhere, \n
Behind a gate, \n
Over a fence \n
to a chain, \n
which gracelessly \n
leads to \n
a cemetery. \n
Here I sit. \n
Oh, \n
how I sit. \n

Once, there was a white cat \n
Who was really, really fat \n
So fat \n
She looked like a bat \n
Who has eaten a huge rat. \n
The cat was walking in the street \n
Following a beat, with her feet \n
Tic, tac, tic, tac \n
Tictactictactictac \n
Looking for anything to eat \n
Milk, fish, tuna, meat... \n
But what a pity \n
The street was empty \n
So empty \n
Not even a birdie \n
To make her get nasty. \n
The cat kept walking in the street \n
Following a beat, with her feet \n
Tic, tac, tic, tac \n
Tic, tac, tic, tac \n
Looking for somewhere to sleep \n
Bed'n'sheets? Get real! Just a seat... \n
But she didn't find any, what a shame \n
Because she was really lame \n
So lame \n
She had forgotten her own name \n
And from where she originally came. \n
So she kept walking in the street \n
Feeling the heat, and pain in her feet \n
Tic, tac, tic, tac \n
Tic, tac \n
Looking for someone to blame \n
Same situation, same game... \n
Then, the white cat \n
Saw a tiny red hat \n
One hat \n
She ran, jumped and sat \n
In it, what a lucky cat! \n
But since she was really fat \n
She got stuck in the hat \n
So stuck \n
She looked like a rat \n
In a cheese trap. \n
A dog came walking in the street \n
Following a beat, with his feet \n
Tic, tac, tictac \n
Tic, tac, tictac \n
He saw something red \n
So he stopped near the cat's head: \n
'Haha! Cat, you pay the fees \n
For acting so bad with your peers! ' \n
'Help, please' \n
'Call me bad boy, I love to tease \n
I'm getting outta here, say cheers! ' \n
Then a bird came flying in the street \n
With his wings, following a beat \n
Tictactictactictac \n
Tictactictactictac< br>He saw something red \n
So he stopped above the cat's head: \n
'Oh, poor white cat \n
Are you trapped in this hat? ' \n
'Damn I am! ' \n
'Let me help you, sad little cat \n
Here, you're out, care for a chat? ' \n

Welcome to the Colosseum \n
Where pain is pleasure and it is our pleasure to be of service \n
Lay back on the rack \n
The waxing poetics are hot and the iced humor is very dry \n
The fence sitter splinters are sharp but the elitist tongues are sharper \n
There are many painful pleasures which abound \n
We guarantee your total satisfaction \n
Or we'll give you fifty lashes of your back for free \n
For no one ever enters with a smile \n
Who doesn't leave here with a grimace \n

The other day \n
I woke up feeling low \n
I tried not to think about you \n
to stop the inevitable tears that threatened to fall. \n
Funny things tears, they linger yet do not fall. \n
That night I got angry \n
as I walked fron the bus stop to my home \n
My mood slowly dissipated into sadness \n
I felt the bloody tears linger \n
am guessing they showed because some ladies looked at me \n
gossiped and actually stood to stare \n
Funny thing tears are, they know no shame. \n
Yesterday I drunk myself into a stupor \n
because I couldnt bear the thoughts \n
the happy memories, the questions. \n
I smoked because I wanted to burn away my pain \n
my loneliness, my intense craving to end it all \n
Funny things tears, they come when you least expect them \n
Last night I hated you \n
Hated my intense stupid love for you \n
Hated that my life was blank without you \n
I went running, jogging to absolve the pain \n
to numb myself, but pain is stubborn \n
I ran for miles but still felt that swift flash. \n
Funny things tears, they burn. \n
Today I woke up \n
ignoring my phone I tried to resist it \n
to resist the urge to call you, \n
But I did, \n
Lunch, drinks, kisses more promises \n
apologies more excuses \n
smiling, laughing, forgetting \n
Funny thing love it forgets the tears easily. \n
Tonight I sleep soundly \n
But Tommorow I work and the cycle begins. \n
Funny things tears sometimes they cleanse you. \n<|endoftext|>
funny \n
Funny how the very ones who \n
say they carry the light, also \n
bear the responsibility for causing \n
most of the pain in the world. \n
Funny how the loudest whiners \n
are the fanciest diners at the \n
buffet of humanity. \n
Funny how the rich are exempt \n
and the poor breed contempt; \n
how the nations with the most to give \n
play the best game of politics \n
supplying the weaponry that \n
eventually kills \n
even their own children. \n
Funny isn’t it how the world works \n
with its upside down righteousness \n
and its lawful in-justice, while \n
all the best parts of mankind are being \n
sucked out through the holes in the ozone \n
or dissolved completely in the furnace of \n
unrestrained industry, avarice and greed. \n
It’s a funny world alright; \n
funny how nobody’s laughing. \n<|endoftext|>
funny \n
Taking my little concerns and miniature \n
plans too seriously instead of laughing \n
at myself, telling all with shiny eyes of \n
my new ideals, taking new medication \n
enabling me to eat less and sitting still \n
for longer periods \n
The sitting still is happening, but without \n
a large dose of interest, is quite useless, \n
mind growing bored tries to veer off, yet \n
discipline keeps me at my desk without \n
accomplishment, boredom grows as I \n
fail to find islands \n
Of glorious escapism to give my feelings \n
a break from cold emptiness, floundering \n
I cast about, the world shrinking to fit into \n
my aching head changing me into a use- \n
less robot without interest, passion or \n
ideal - immobile \n
Without feeling and emotion - without \n
conscience to power movement of my \n
head and eyes, reading words without \n
understanding anything, unable to set \n
priorities - I have become a useless \n
robot - at least \n
I used to be a funny human being \n<|endoftext|>

Its funny how when you need someone they're never around, \n

A baby boy is born, a sweet, innocent black baby boy. \n
comes to this world as a –child—not a toy. \n
His needs will be different for he is a black male. \n
Proper nurturing is crucial to keep him out of jail. \n
He must know society considers him a stereotype. \n
Lazy, drug user, sexually motivated, full of hype. \n
Speak gently with loving words for him to hear \n
Teach him to be strong, yet gentle enough to shed a tear \n
Put a smile on his face with your warm embrace. \n
Respect him, love him, teach him to have good taste \n
What you see is what you get in your baby boys eyes \n
He may follow in your footsteps, don’t be surprised \n
Teach him with patience, no need for raised voices \n
He must know how to make all the right choices \n
The word “no” is prevalent when raising a boy. \n
He must know what it means when he seeks a certain joy. \n
A mama is put on a pedestal from a male perspective \n
when she falls, it shatters his number one directive \n
Let him know on a daily basis that he is your special joy \n
a gift from God, a blessed black baby boy. \n<|endoftext|>

Favorite people to embrace, \n
Loving smiles and caring looks \n

Above the lemon-rind bitterness that loving and leaving \n
Leaves behind, residual regret resounds off the walls \n
Of my aching but throbbingly alive consciousness \n
Cool clear skies beckon with the promise of freedom \n
Of clarity, peace of mind, rare insight and flight \n
But my attachment to the past is cemented \n
Like the stubborn slivers that truss the clam to its shell \n
And the barnacle to its rock, calm reason and stock taking \n
Do not help sever these ties that bind and gag but only drag \n
Me deeper down into the morass – steaming, fuming \n
With noxious odors and malodorous vapors \n
That simply swell the fog to cumbersome proportions \n
Rise I will though, buoyed by the spirit within my very cells \n
Ringing with life and the promise that the future holds many surprises \n

Almost nearly done; \n
The garden's so young \n
With all what we long, \n
The seeds in the earth \n
There in their first birth. \n
Baby blue eyes \n
Beginning to glow, \n
After winter's goodbyes \n
And old frosty snow; \n

Knowing new life \n

baby \n
As a drenched, drowned bee \n
Hangs numb and heavy from a bending flower, \n
So clings to me \n
My baby, her brown hair brushed with wet tears \n
And laid against her cheek; \n
Her soft white legs hanging heavily over my arm \n
Swinging heavily to my movements as I walk. \n
My sleeping baby hangs upon my life, \n
Like a burden she hangs on me. \n
She has always seemed so light, \n
But now she is wet with tears and numb with pain \n
Even her floating hair sinks heavily, \n
Reaching downwards; \n
As the wings of a drenched, drowned bee \n
Are a heaviness, and a weariness. \n<|endoftext|>

For years together there were no rains \n
We adulated you, my God, impatiently then. \n
Requesting you to allow rains to rain, \n

Hungry we were and in search of bread, \n
In search of water, tears we had to shed. \n
Nothing we could do other than devotion, \n
Expiating always for all the committed sins. \n
No one could stop the harsh man slaughter \n
No one could bring on dry lips a laughter. \n
Then came a day, the day of your glory, \n
Every side fainted with cats and dogs raining. \n

Oh God, do you want us only difficulties to face. \n<|endoftext|>

A LA FRANCE \n
France! ô belle contrée, ô terre généreuse, \n
Que les dieux complaisants formaient pour être heureuse, \n
Tu ne sens point du nord les glaçantes horreurs, \n
Le midi de ses feux t'épargne les fureurs. \n
Tes arbres innocents n'ont point d'ombres mortelles; \n
Ni des poisons épars dans tes herbes nouvelles \n
Ne trompent une main crédule; ni tes bois \n
Des tigres frémissants ne redoutent la voix; \n
Ni les vastes serpents ne traînent sur tes plantes \n
En longs cercles hideux leurs écailles sonnantes. \n
Les chênes, les sapins et les ormes épais \n
En utiles rameaux ombragent tes sommets, \n
Et de Beaune et d'Aï les rives fortunées, \n
Et la riche Aquitaine, et les hauts Pyrénées, \n
Sous leurs bruyants pressoirs font couler en ruisseaux \n
Des vins délicieux mûris sur leurs coteaux. \n
La Provence odorante et de Zéphire aimée \n
Respire sur les mers une haleine embaumée, \n
Au bord des flots couvrant, délicieux trésor, \n
L'orange et le citron de leur tunique d'or, \n
Et plus loin, au penchant des collines pierreuses, \n
Forme la grasse olive aux liqueurs savoureuses, \n
Et ces réseaux légers, diaphanes habits, \n
Où la fraîche grenade enferme ses rubis. \n
Sur tes rochers touffus la chèvre se hérisse, \n
Tes prés enflent de lait la féconde génisse, \n
Et tu vois tes brebis, sur le jeune gazon, \n
Épaissir le tissu de leur blanche toison. \n
Dans les fertiles champs voisins de la Touraine, \n
Dans ceux où l'Océan boit l'urne de la Seine, \n
S'élèvent pour le frein des coursiers belliqueux. \n
Ajoutez cet amas de fleuves tortueux: \n
L'indomptable Garonne aux vagues insensées, \n
Le Rhône impétueux, fils des Alpes glacées, \n
La Seine au flot royal, la Loire dans son sein \n
Incertaine, et la Saône, et mille autres enfin \n
Qui, nourrissant partout, sur tes nobles rivages, \n
Fleurs, moissons et vergers, et bois et pâturages, \n
Rampent au pied des murs d'opulentes cités \n
Sous les arches de pierre à grand bruit emportés. \n
Dirai-je ces travaux, source de l'abondance, \n
Ces ports où des deux mers l'active bienfaisance \n
Amène les tributs du rivage lointain \n
Que visite Phoebus le soir ou le matin? \n
Dirai-je ces canaux, ces montagnes percées, \n
De bassins en bassins ces ondes amassées \n
Pour joindre au pied des monts l'une et l'autre Téthys, \n
Et ces vastes chemins en tous lieux départis, \n
Où l'étranger, à l'aise achevant son voyage, \n
Pense au nom des Trudaine et bénit leur ouvrage? \n
Ton peuple industrieux est né pour les combats. \n
Le glaive, le mousquet n'accablent point ses bras. \n
Il s'élance aux assauts, et son fer intrépide \n
Chassa l'impie Anglais, usurpateur avide. \n
Le ciel les fit humains, hospitaliers et bons, \n
Amis des doux plaisirs, des festins, des chansons; \n
Mais, faibles, opprimés, la tristesse inquiète \n
Glace ces chants joyeux sur leur bouche muette, \n
Pour les jeux, pour la danse appesantit leurs pas, \n
Renverse devant eux les tables des repas, \n
Flétrit de longs soucis, empreinte douloureuse, \n
Et leur front et leur âme. O France! trop heureuse \n
Si tu voyais tes biens, si tu profitais mieux \n
Des dons que tu reçus de la bonté des cieux! \n
Vois le superbe Anglais, l'Anglais dont le courage \n
Ne s'est sentais qu'aux lois d'un sénat libre et sage, \n
Qui t'épie, et, dans l'Inde éclipsant ta splendeur, \n
Sur tes fautes sans nombre élève sa grandeur. \n
Il triomphe, il t'insulte. Oh! combien tes collines \n
Tressailliraient de voir réparer tes ruines, \n
Et pour la liberté donneraient sans regrets \n
Et leur vin, et leur huile, et leurs belles forêts! \n
J'ai vu dans tes hameaux la plaintive misère, \n
La mendicité blême et la douleur amère. \n
Je t'ai vu dans tes biens, indigent laboureur, \n
D'un fisc avare et dur maudissant la rigueur, \n
Versant aux pieds des grands des larmes inutiles, \n
Tout trempé de sueurs pour toi-même infertiles, \n
Découragé de vivre, et plein d'un juste effroi \n
De mettre au jour des fils malheureux comme toi. \n
Tu vois sous les soldats les villes gémissantes; \n
Corvée, impôts rongeurs, tributs, taxes pesantes, \n
Le sel, fils de la terre, ou même l'eau des mers, \n
Sources d'oppression et de fléaux divers; \n
Mille brigands, couverts du nom sacré du prince, \n
S'unir à déchirer une triste province, \n
Et courir à l'envi, de son sang altérés, \n
Se partager entre eux ses membres déchirés! \n
O sainte Égalité! dissipe nos ténèbres, \n
Renverse les verrous, les bastilles funèbres. \n
Le riche indifférent, dans un char promené, \n
De ces gouffres secrets partout environné, \n
Rit avec les bourreaux, s'il n'est bourreau lui-même, \n
Près de ces noirs réduits de la misère extrême, \n
D'une maîtresse impure achète les transports, \n
Chante sur des tombeaux, et boit parmi des morts. \n
Malesherbes, Turgot, ô vous en qui la France \n
Vit luire, hélas! en vain, sa dernière espérance; \n
Ministres dont le coeur a connu la pitié, \n
Ministres dont le nom ne s'est point oublié, \n
Ah! si de telles mains, justement souveraines, \n
Toujours de cet empire avaient tenu les rênes! \n
L'équité clairvoyante aurait régné sur nous; \n
Le faible aurait osé respirer près de vous; \n
L'oppresseur, évitant d'armer d'injustes plaintes, \n
Sinon quelque pudeur, aurait ou quelques craintes; \n
Le délateur impie, opprimé par la faim, \n
Serait mort dans l'opprobre, et tant d'hommes enfin, \n
A l'insu de nos lois, à l'insu, du vulgaire, \n
Foudroyés sons les coups d'un pouvoir arbitraire, \n
De cris non entendus, de funèbres sanglots, \n
Ne feraient point gémir les voûtes des cachots. \n
Non, je ne veux plus vivre en ce séjour servile! \n
J'irai, j'irai bien loin me chercher un asile, \n
Un asile à ma vie en son paisible cours, \n
Une tombe à ma cendre à la fin de mes jours, \n
Où d'un grand au coeur dur l'opulence homicide \n
Du sang d'un peuple entier ne sera point avide, \n
Et ne me dira point, avec un rire affreux, \n
Qu'ils se plaignent sans cesse et qu'ils sont trop heureux; \n
Où, loin des ravisseurs, la main cultivatrice \n
Recueille les dons d'une terre propice; \n
Où mon coeur, respirant sous un ciel étranger, \n
Ne verra plus des maux qu'il ne peut soulager; \n
Où mes yeux, éloignés des publiques misères, \n
Ne verront plus partout les larmes de mes frères, \n
Et la pâle indigence à la mourante voix, \n
Et les crimes puissants qui font trembler les lois. \n
Toi donc, Équité sainte, ô toi, vierge adorée, \n
De nos tristes climats pour longtemps ignorée, \n
Daigne du haut des cieux goûter le libre encens \n
D'une lyre au coeur chaste, aux transports innocents, \n
Qui ne saura jamais, par des voeux mercenaires, \n
Flatter, à prix d'argent, des faveurs arbitraires, \n
Mais qui rendra toujours, par amour et par choix, \n
Un noble et pur hommage aux appuis de tes lois. \n
De voeux pour les humains tous ses chants retentissent: \n
La vérité l'enflamme, et ses cordes frémissent \n
Quand l'air qui l'environne auprès d'elle a porté \n
Le doux nom des vertus et de la liberté. \n<|endoftext|>

Never quelled by yoke or rod, \n
Founders of Jerusalem- \n

Seeker of dead cities, say! \n

Scattered broadcast o'er the lands, \n
Knit in spirit nigh and far, \n
With indissoluble bands. \n
Half the world adores their God, \n

Stripes and scourgings, death and shame. \n

Is capital punishment justice or is it revenge? \n
This is the question that I want to defend. \n
Is it really justice if you have to kill someone? \n
Or is the killing of a being just for your fun? \n
Is a murder really justified if the culprit spends less time in jail? \n
If so then it seems capital punishment is just easy bail. \n
They should be punished and not given an out of jail card, \n
All capital punishment is doing is spending money, cold and hard. \n
Wanting them to die doesn’t seem like justice but revenge? \n
It leaves blood on your hands when there life ends. \n
Life is full of trials and tribulations this is a must, \n
But if you kill a man then it won’t make life any more just. \n
Justice is using authority to give a fair decree, \n
But intended death to a being doesn’t seem fair to me. \n
Revenge is to satisfy in retaliation, \n
But death’s your one hit wonder, one satisfaction. \n
So I will always choose the criminals to defend, \n
Leaving you with your decision: justice or revenge? \n<|endoftext|>

The unfair injury burdened upon the shoulders of the African men and women. \n
The echoes of slavery constantly overshadows America’s path to the future. \n
Memories of yesterdays gone; times that we hope will never return again. \n
The cries from the hurt, forced, chained and scared treading waters to places untold. \n
Tossed up and down upon the waves in the belly of the smelly wooden beast, \n
Chained up together and stacked so tight, there is no more hope for a safe retreat. \n
Longing and hoping for just a few moments of quietness and rest to escape. \n
Quietly yearning for the days past before this humiliating enslavement of defeat. \n
The dreadful hours turn into days; then suddenly followed by weeks and months. \n
The stench of former kings and queens mingles with the rotten flesh of the dead. \n
The useless cargo is buried without ceremony into the darkness of the deep sea. \n
Days later, the wooden beast unloads its scared cargo and is paid for each live head. \n
The dark skinned children of Africa forced to survive upon a distant hateful land. \n
Slaves nightly beaten until just can not take any more so quickly submit instead. \n
Fed like hogs; treated worse than dogs, force to sleep with the master or the wife. \n
If not obedient, the slave might be starved, beaten or have a bullet put in the head. \n
Oh, the scars run so deep through many descendants of the former kings and queens. \n
Forced to survive and fend for themselves; their forced servitude no longer is needed. \n
Required to hide in the dark backwoods of society like a secret no one wanted to be told. \n
Bowing and scraping just so Mr. Johnnie will feel good and hoping not to be mistreated. \n
Life off the plantation, faced with the promises of reconciliation never to be delivered. \n
It was just a lie to make them feel good about their wrongs committed to the African. \n
Promises made were quickly broken and any hope for equality was chased quickly away. \n
The seeds of the American slave should not speak up for fear of the dread white man’s hand. \n
Time progressed as the dreaded years turned into frightening decades of a different century. \n
Multitudes died as racist countrymen hunted them down just because they wanted the right to vote. \n
Politicians and preachers stood idle while the children of African-American slaves were hunted down. \n
Some were brave enough to speak the truth; he got shot and she ended up dangling from the end of a rope. \n
Decades later, things misleadingly seem to have changed a little except the plantation has gotten bigger. \n
No longer shipped over on the wooden beast; can forget freezing inside the plantation cold, battered shed. \n
Life has become more complicated, the necessity has now made every American an unwilling slave. \n
Working hard hoping to make the American dream come true then the job relocates oversees instead. \n
Today, no work, crime is rising and no one is living well on the great American corporate plantation. \n
The greed of the masters overshadows the prosperity dreamed of as new slaves willingly came ashore. \n
To be ground like meat for sausage some sold their very soul on the auction block of aspiration. \n
Only to sadly realize they are really slaves when instead of losing profit, they are often shown the door. \n
The unfair injury once burdened upon the shoulders of the African men and women. \n
The echoes of a slave's past rapidly overtakes America’s path to the unsure future. \n
Memories of yesterdays gone; prosperous times that we hope will somehow return again. \n
The past crimes done, now, cry out for justice because the need for reconciliation still exists. \n<|endoftext|>

Let us see \n<|endoftext|>
justice \n
I was just staggering in the gate \n
with two heavy bags \n
from an exhausting week’s conference \n
when the conman and his accomplice \n
got me right at my own front door – \n
I’m mortified by the memory – \n
they could replace my missing roof tiles \n
in a moment, look, the ladder’s \n
already up there, the accomplice \n
is halfway up, now he’s already \n
on the roof in his plimsolls, now he's \n
shaking the chimney-stack, look, it's loose \n
.... no cash? oh, \n
they’d drive me to the nearest cash-point… \n
well, you can guess the rest – \n
anything for a quiet life… \n
as I dozed off that evening, \n
flushed with anger, blushed with stupidity, \n
too tired to crawl to bed, \n
realizing that conmen have \n
all the skills of hypnotists, \n
enlightenment struck: \n
the next morning, I would wake up \n
150 dollars the poorer but morning-fresh; \n
‘they’ would wake up with the urgent need \n
to seek another mug each day. \n
And I realised that sublime, ruthless, \n
beautiful, tragic, comic, eternal justice \n
is - to be – to live it through as - \n
just as we are; right now… \n
heroes or victims of ourself \n
justice \n
O shy maiden, cooking a time-torn dish, \n
You sail on high seas, always far from beach, \n
Ensconced in thine lofty principled niche, \n
When arrive, is not it too late to reach? \n
I feel thine conscience is still alive, \n
Ye show lady justice blind. But she's lame. \n
Stays and delays her single most ill-fame, \n
What good, in two decades should she arrive? \n
If there be wrong that whole world has well seen, \n
The court it seems is not satisfied still, \n
No crime leaves confession, nor yet signed will, \n
Time, justice contemplates and looks within. \n
A victim of justice is good as killed, \n
But there's one more— whole legal edifice, \n
And the system, with bureaucracy filled, \n
And true victim is the very justice. \n
Ye bank too much on the letter of law, \n
But letter's fine if it carries spirit, \n
Blindfolded, justice can still be in awe, \n
Too much process makes justice no more fit. \n
Thine chairs sticky seem of privileges, \n
Ready to threaten with contempt of court, \n
Lofty chairs too serve public on wages, \n
No one need sit in an isolate fort. \n
And here the courts woke up by public noise; \n
I wish it'd kept its own alarm warnings, \n
But was reposed on procedural poise, \n
When stirred it walked when should fly on all wings. \n
Let courts rid old baggage, all the vain load, \n
It should still run, let jagged get the rough road. \n
The killers of Jessica Lall virtually walked away free. Let's not blame just the powerful and rich perpetrators of the crime. The real culprit here seems to be our legal and judicial system, and the law enforcers. She scarce is the only victim. The true Victim is justice itself. Victim, is our collective conscience as well, and our collective heart hardening fast. \n

family \n
We've got a family album \n
Like a family tree \n
A thrill to turn the pages \n
The pictures we can see \n
Starting off with grands and greats \n
Then slowly down the line \n
Like a book of history \n
A journey through the time \n
Fashions start to alter \n
Mustaches come and go \n
Ladies skirts skip up and down \n
A proper fashion show \n
Top hats change to boaters \n
To caps then none at all \n
Ladies bonnets disappear \n
And so does grannies shawl \n
Picture's change to colour \n
Black and white has gone \n
A different place, a different time \n
So much to look upon \n
But what is so amazing \n
Is the likeness we can see \n
Showing up the genes \n
Right through our family tree \n<|endoftext|>
family \n
A family gives you unconditional love, \n
Strength and guidance they got form above \n
They listen when you need and ear \n
And one thing is they always care \n
When you need a hand \n
They’ll lend you theirs \n
If you’re crying they’ll wipe you tears \n
If you need comfort, you know where to go \n
Their love is never hidden it is always shown \n
They always boast about you to anyone they meet \n
Family, friends and even strangers on the street \n
A family is a precious and kind \n
A family is truly divine \n
A family is God’s gift to everyone \n
They are what make your house your home \n
To be appreciated you don’t have to go far \n
Because your family loves you for who you are \n<|endoftext|>

He was the king \n
Dhamayanthi was certain \n
That the cook was Nalan. \n
She told this to her father \n
“As a cook, Nalan is here.” \n
Vimarasan got confused \n
Vimarasan saw the cook, \n
But with cook’s ugly look, \n
He got confused, how that man \n
Could be his daughter’s Nalan? \n
From the talk he learnt \n
The cook talked like Nalan, \n
So, it could be her Nalan, \n
At first, Vimarasan guessed. \n
This finally, he confirmed.” \n
Show your real shape \n
Vimarasan said, ‘Oh Nalan, \n
Of this great land you own, \n
This is not your shape. \n
Show me your real shape.” \n
King Cobra’s robe \n
Nalan thought for while, \n
And gave a soft smile. \n
He got himself dressed. \n
With the robe he had. \n
(The robe was given \n
By the King Cobra) \n
Charioteer was gone \n
The shape of charioteer, \n
Was no more there, \n
Instead, the great warrior \n
King Nalan stood there. \n
Children found \n
His children shed tears \n
When they saw their father, \n
And fell at his feet \n
As a mark of respect. \n
How Dhamayanthi came? \n
There Dhamayanthi came \n
Wearing half cut sari, the same \n
One she wore in the forest. \n
With tears, she fell at his feet. \n
Tears covered her vision \n
He left her alone in the forest \n
Because her eyes were shut. \n
Now the tears blocked her vision. \n
So, clearly she couldn’t see Nalan. \n
Flowers rained \n
All Devas from the heaven \n
Showered flowers like rain. \n
They said, “Is there anyone \n
So noble like this Nalan? ” \n
Kali’s request \n
Before Nalan, Kali appeared. \n
“Oh king, I’m well pleased. \n
For chastity, it’s your woman. \n
For justice, you’re the one.” \n
“You ask for any boon. \n
I’ll grant the same one.” \n
This Nalan’s story did melt, \n
Even the Kali’s stone heart. \n
Don’t go near \n
Nalan prayed, “Don’t go near \n
Those pious people, who hear \n
My story and trouble them \n
Now or at any time.” \n
Kali’s promise \n
Kali said, “I promise \n
That I’ll not catch those \n
Who hear your story, \n
Or cause them any worry.” \n
Gave a feast \n
Vimarasan gave a feast \n
To Nalan and the rest, \n
To celebrate their reunion \n
After years of separation. \n
Ayodhya King requested \n
Ayodhya King requested \n
“I may kindly be excused, ” \n
He took leave of Nalan, \n
And went back alone. \n<|endoftext|>

Of all the silver and the gold, \n

and listen to the birds that sing. \n
And then O’ God inside of me a voice \n
speaks so soft and sweet! And then I \n
raise my hands to Thee and Thank You \n
for my family. The trees in all their beauty be.... \n
In God's creation speaks to me. The \n
grass, the flowers and all the shrubs \n
and indications of God's love. The \n
mountains, valleys, hills, and vales \n
and even along some lonesome trail \n
and then O’ God inside of me a voice speaks so soft \n
and sweet, and then I raise my hands to Thee \n
and Thank You for my family. We are all created by God above, and \n
brought together by His love. We are one \n
blood, we are all kin, and we are also \n
each others friend. Wherever we travel across this land, we pray that God will \n
hold our hands. From every sea to shining sea, \n
where ever I go, wherever I be the soft sweet \n
voice speaks inside of me, and then I raise \n
my hands to Thee, O’ God, Thank You for my \n

family \n
To my dearest family, some things I'd like to say, \n
But first of all to let you know that I arrived okay. \n
I'm writing this from Heaven, where I dwell with God above, \n
Where there are no tears or sadness, there is just eternal Love. \n
Please do not be unhappy, just because I'm out of sight, \n
Remember that I'm with you, every morning, noon and night. \n
That day I had to leave you, when my life on earth was through, \n
God picked me up and hugged me, and said, ' I welcome you'. \n
'It's good to have you back again. \n
You were missed while you were gone. \n
As for your dearest family, they'll be here later on. \n
I need you here so badly as part of my big plan. \n
There's so much that we have to do, to help our mortal man'. \n
Then God gave me a list of things he wished for me to do. \n
And foremost on that list of mine, is to watch and care for you. \n
I will be beside you, every day of the week and year, \n
And when you're sad I'm standing there, to wipe away the tear. \n
And when you lie in bed at night, the day's chores put to flight, \n
God and I are closest to you in the middle of the night. \n
When you think of my life on Earth, and all those loving years, \n
Because you're only human, there's bound to be some tears. \n
One thing is for certain, though my life on Earth is over, \n
I am closer to you now than I ever was before. \n
And to my many friends, trust God knows what is best. \n
I am not far away from you, I'm just beyond the crest. \n
There are rocky roads ahead for you and many hills to climb, \n
Together we can do it, taking one day at a time. \n
It was my philosophy and please I'd like for you, \n
To give unto the world, so the world will give to you. \n
If you can help someone who's in sorrow or in pain, \n
Then you can say to God at night, my day was not in vain. \n
And now I am contented that my life it was worthwhile, \n
Knowing as I passed along the way, I made somebody smile. \n
When you're walking down the street and I am on your mind, \n
I'm walking in your footsteps, only half a step behind. \n
And when you feel a gentle breeze of wind upon your face, \n
That's me giving you a great big hug, or just a s oft embrace. \n
When it's time for you to go from that body to be free, \n
Remember you are not going, you are coming home to me. \n
I will always love you, from that place way up above, \n
I will be in touch again soon. \n
P.S. God sends his love. \n
For Tammy, my beautiful Aunt \n<|endoftext|>
family \n
When we talk of family, \n
it’s not always about our blood kin. \n
Sometimes it’s about a group of friends \n
whom have become more family \n
than the real ones we have. \n
They are there with comfort \n
whenever tragedy strikes \n
with a kind of love \n
that wraps around you \n
and comforts your troubled soul. \n
You gather your family close to you, \n
so whenever sadness comes along \n
you will know you will have \n
someone to call upon. \n

family \n
They keep it so well hidden \n
This trait they won’t admit \n
In this family it’s forbidden \n
To ever mention it \n
Are they fearful of the flow \n
This trait of theirs brings on? \n
Afraid if people know \n
They’d be oh so woebegone? \n
Their secret hides a social ill \n
It’s an unacceptable addiction \n
This trait results in over-kill \n
It’s an anti-social affliction \n
Convinced they’ve gone astray \n
They crawl into cocoons \n
It appears it’s not okay \n
Their feasting on dried prunes \n
To hell with high society \n
This family won’t succumb \n
To hell with snob propriety \n
They won’t switch from prunes to plums \n
There must be things much worse \n
Though they can’t imagine what \n
Is it really such a curse \n
This secret that they’ve got? \n<|endoftext|>
family \n
Hinemoa, Tui, Maina, \n
All of them were born together; \n
They are quite an extra special \n
Set of babies--wax and leather. \n
Every day they took an airing; \n
Mummy made them each a bonnet; \n
Two were cherry, one was yellow \n
With a bow of ribbon on it. \n
Really, sometimes we would slap them, \n
For if ever we were talking, \n
They would giggle and be silly, \n
Saying, "Mamma, take us walking." \n
But we never really loved them \n
Till one day we left them lying \n
In the garden--through a hail-storm, \n
And we heard the poor dears crying. \n
Half-Past-Six said--"You're a mother! \n
What if Mummy did forget you?" \n
So I said, "Well, you're their Father. \n
Get them!" but I wouldn't let you. \n<|endoftext|>
family \n
A family is a tree \n
with its branches and leaves. \n
Come rain, come shine, \n
it staggers yet lives. \n
A family is a body \n
with its head, hands and fingers. \n
In sickness or in health, \n
it shivers and lingers. \n
A family is a world \n
with its inhabitants, lands and tides. \n
In pressure and turmoils, \n
it quakes but abides. \n
A family is you and I \n
engulfed in love. \n
Come what may, \n
we soar like a dove! \n<|endoftext|>
family \n
Part of my family is grown up and tall. \n
Part of my family is little and small. \n
I'm in the middle and pleased with them all. \n<|endoftext|>
family \n
You put up with it because \n
as tiresome as it is, and as they can sometimes be, \n
somewhere there, there's always love. \n
He may take interest \n
in something to be repaired \n
that's mechanical; and \n
there's cars to wash and clean, \n
hobby things to sort and tidy. \n
Some kids are good or disciplined; \n
but there's never quite the time \n
in their expanding world \n
for doing just what you do \n
for the house.. \n
But in the human heart \n
there's this locked, dusty room - you haven't dared \n
to look inside for years - or indeed \n
since childhood, for some people - \n
full of junk, of cobwebs, \n
broken windows, their sashes jammed, \n
cupboards that won't open, drawers \n
whose contents stop them opening; even \n
the birds have stopped their nesting there; \n
a room of memories that whisper when it's dark \n
It's the room that's family. \n
And surprise - the light still works.. \n
A family can sort and dust and wash and clean and tidy it \n
in less time than they take \n
to slam the door \n
yet only you know that it's done, and how it's done. \n
And you say nothing. \n
Somewhere, two strangers \n
smile at one another \n<|endoftext|>
family \n
Family to me has many meanings \n
For all are full of diverse feelings \n
Love and anger, both within a single one \n
Children who stay and children who run \n
Can one family be better than another? \n
It all depends on how they love each other \n
A family’s love should last forever \n
Bonds of love nothing can sever \n
For the family I have, I am happy and blessed \n
And nothing more truthful have I ever confessed \n
Family has many meanings, but one rises above \n
The greatest meaning of family, is that of love \n<|endoftext|>

Your family loves you \n

Nothing can buy them \n

You away from your \n
Love with your family. \n
Your family will love \n
You even when you \n
Do stupid things \n

Nearly killing yourself. \n

I have loved colours, and not flowers; \n
Their motion, not the swallows wings; \n
And wasted more than half my hours \n
Without the comradeship of things. \n
How is it, now, that I can see, \n
With love and wonder and delight, \n
The children of the hedge and tree, \n
The little lords of day and night? \n
How is it that I see the roads, \n
No longer with usurping eyes, \n
A twilight meeting-place for toads, \n
A mid-day mart for butterflies? \n
I feel, in every midge that hums, \n
Life, fugitive and infinite, \n
And suddenly the world becomes \n
A part of me and I of it. \n<|endoftext|>

Thence take you wing unto the Orcades; \n
There let my verse get glory in the North, \n
Making my sighs to thaw the frozen seas; \n
And let the Bards within that Irish isle, \n
To whom my Muse with fiery wing shall pass, \n
Call back the stiff-neck'd rebels from exile, \n
And mollify the slaught'ring Gallowglass; \n
And when my flowing numbers they rehearse, \n
Let wolves and bears be charmed with my verse. \n<|endoftext|>

Intense heat, with increased glare \n
A time lag, from there to here \n
Waves arrive, earth's atmosphere \n

Waves of light, to those aware \n

theres an ode in every nuance, \n
as loves wonder unlocks, \n
theres rhythm in every sound, \n
every beating of a heart, \n
theres poetry in every union \n
and every couple who are apart \n
and just as there is wonder \n
in every new life created \n
there is sadness and regret, \n
for the unsaid and unfeted \n
just listen for the music \n
that your ears cannot hear, \n
just strain yourself for the melody \n
thats so far and yet so near \n
the wonder of the creator, \n
the magic of the divine \n
is there to feel, for all of us, \n
to soon be yours and mine \n<|endoftext|>
nature \n
Ye green-rob'd Dryads, oft' at dusky Eve \n
By wondering Shepherds seen, to Forests brown, \n
To unfrequented Meads, and pathless Wilds, \n
Lead me from Gardens deckt with Art's vain Pomps. \n
Can gilt Alcoves, can Marble-mimic Gods, \n
Parterres embroider'd, Obelisks, and Urns \n
Of high Relief; can the long, spreading Lake, \n
Or Vista lessening to the Sight; can Stow \n
With all her Attic Fanes, such Raptures raise, \n
As the Thrush-haunted Copse, where lightly leaps \n
The fearful Fawn the rustling Leaves along, \n
And the brisk Squirrel sports from Bough to Bough, \n
While from an hollow Oak the busy Bees \n
Hum drowsy Lullabies? The Bards of old, \n
Fair Nature's Friends, sought such Retreats, to charm \n
Sweet Echo with their Songs; oft' too they met, \n
In Summer Evenings, near sequester'd Bow'rs, \n
Or Mountain-Nymph, or Muse, and eager learnt \n
The moral Strains she taught to mend Mankind. \n
As to a secret Grot Ægeria stole \n
With Patriot Numa, and in silent Night \n
Whisper'd him sacred Laws, he list'ning sat \n
Rapt with her virtuous Voice, old Tyber leant \n
Attentive on his Urn, and husht his Waves. \n
Rich in her weeping Country's Spoils Versailles \n
May boast a thousand Fountains, that can cast \n
The tortur'd Waters to the distant Heav'ns; \n
Yet let me choose some Pine-topt Precipice \n
Abrupt and shaggy, whence a foamy Stream, \n
Like Anio, tumbling roars; or some bleak Heath, \n
Where straggling stand the mournful Juniper, \n
Or Yew-tree scath'd; while in clear Prospect round, \n
From the Grove's Bosom Spires emerge, and Smoak \n
In bluish Wreaths ascends, ripe Harvests wave, \n
Herds low, and Straw-rooft Cotts appear, and Streams \n
Beneath the Sun-beams twinkle -- The shrill Lark, \n
That wakes the Wood-man to his early Task, \n
Or love-sick Philomel, whose luscious Lays \n
Sooth lone Night-wanderers, the moaning Dove \n
Pitied by listening Milkmaid, far excell \n
The deep-mouth'd Viol, the Soul-lulling Lute, \n
And Battle-breathing Trumpet. Artful Sounds! \n
That please not like the Choristers of Air, \n
When first they hail th'Approach of laughing May. \n
Creative Titian, can thy vivid Strokes, \n
Or thine, O graceful Raphael, dare to vie \n
With the rich Tints that paint the breathing Mead? \n
The thousand-colour'd Tulip, Violet's Bell \n
Snow-clad and meek, the Vermil-tinctur'd Rose, \n
And golden Crocus? -- Yet with these the Maid, \n
Phillis or Phoebe, at a Feast or Wake, \n
Her jetty Locks enamels; fairer she, \n
In Innocence and home-spun Vestments drest, \n
Than if coerulean Sapphires at her Ears \n
Shone pendant, or a precious Diamond-Cross \n
Heav'd gently on her panting Bosom white. \n
Yon' Shepherd idly stretcht on the rude Rock, \n
Listening to dashing Waves, and Sea-Mews Clang \n
High-hovering o'er his Head, who views beneath \n
The Dolphin dancing o'er the level Brine, \n
Feels more true Bliss than the proud Ammiral, \n
Amid his Vessels bright with burnish'd Gold \n
And silken Streamers, tho' his lordly Nod \n
Ten thousand War-worn Mariners revere. \n
And great Æneas gaz'd with more Delight \n
On the rough Mountain shagg'd with horrid Shades, \n
(Where Cloud-compelling Jove, as Fancy dream'd, \n
Descending shook his direful Ægis black) \n
Than if he enter'd the high Capitol \n
On golden Columns rear'd, a conquer'd World \n
Contributing to deck its stately Head: \n
More pleas'd he slept in poor Evander's Cott \n
On shaggy Skins, lull'd by sweet Nightingales, \n
Than if a Nero, in an Age refin'd, \n
Beneath a gorgeous Canopy had plac'd \n
His royal Guest, and bade his Minstrels sound \n
Soft slumb'rous Lydian Airs to sooth his Rest. \n
Happy the first of Men, ere yet confin'd \n
To smoaky Cities; who in sheltering Groves, \n
Warm Caves, and deep-sunk Vallies liv'd and lov'd, \n
By Cares unwounded; what the Sun and Showers, \n
And genial Earth untillag'd could produce, \n
They gather'd grateful, or the Acorn brown, \n
Or blushing Berry; by the liquid Lapse \n
Of murm'ring Waters call'd to slake their Thirst, \n
Or with fair Nymphs their Sun-brown Limbs to bathe; \n
With Nymphs who fondly clasp'd their fav'rite Youths, \n
Unaw'd by Shame, beneath the Beechen Shade, \n
Nor Wiles, nor artificial Coyness knew. \n
Then Doors and Walls were not; the melting Maid \n
Nor Frowns of Parents fear'd, nor Husband's Threats; \n
Nor had curs'd Gold their tender Hearts allur'd; \n
Then Beauty was not venal. Injur'd Love, \n
O whither, God of Raptures, art thou fled? \n
While Avarice waves his golden Wand around, \n
Abhorr'd Magician, and his costly Cup \n
Prepares with baneful Drugs, t'enchant the Souls \n
Of each low-thoughted Fair to wed for Gain. \n
What tho' unknown to those primæval Sires, \n
The well-arch'd Dome, peopled with breathing Forms \n
By fair Italia's skilful Hand, unknown \n
The shapely Column, and the crumbling Busts \n
Of awful Ancestors in long Descent? \n
Yet why should Man mistaken deem it nobler \n
To dwell in Palaces, and high-rooft Halls, \n
Than in God's Forests, Architect supreme! \n
Say, is the Persian Carpet, than the Field's \n
Or Meadow's Mantle gay, more richly wov'n'; \n
Or softer to the Votaries of Ease, \n
Than bladed Grass, perfum'd with dew-dropt Flow'rs? \n
O Taste corrupt! that Luxury and Pomp \n
In specious Names of polish'd Manners veil'd, \n
Should proudly banish Nature's simple Charms. \n
Tho' the fierce North oft smote with Iron Whip \n
Their shiv'ring Limbs, tho' oft the bristly Boar \n
Or hungry Lion 'woke them with their Howls, \n
And scar'd them from their Moss-grown Caves to rove, \n
Houseless and cold in dark, tempestuous Nights; \n
Yet were not Myriads in embattled Fields \n
Swept off at once, nor had the raving Seas \n
O'erwhelm'd the foundering Bark, and helpless Crew; \n
In vain the glassy Ocean smil'd to tempt \n
The jolly Sailor, unsuspecting Harm, \n
For Commerce was unknown. Then Want and Pine \n
Sunk to the Grave their fainting Limbs; but Us \n
Excess and endless Riot doom to die. \n
They cropt unweetingly, the poisonous Herb \n
But wiser we spontaneously provide \n
Rare powerful Roots, to quench Life's chearful Lamp. \n
What are the Lays of artful Addison, \n
Coldly correct, to Shakespear's Warblings wild? \n
Whom on the winding Avon's willow'd Banks \n
Fair Fancy found, and bore the smiling Babe \n
To a close Cavern: (still the Shepherds shew \n
The sacred Place, whence with religious Awe \n
They hear, returning from the Field at Eve, \n
Strange Whisperings of sweet Music thro' the Air) \n
Here, as with Honey gather'd from the Rock, \n
She fed the little Prattler, and with Songs \n
Oft' sooth'd his wondering Ears, with deep Delight \n
On her soft Lap he sat, and caught the Sounds. \n
Oft' near some crowded City would I walk, \n
Listening the far-off Noises, rattling Carrs, \n
Loud Shouts of Joy, sad Shrieks of Sorrow, Knells \n
Full slowly tolling, Instruments of Trade, \n
Striking mine Ears with one deep-swelling Hum. \n
Or wandering near the Sea, attend the Sounds \n
Of hollow Winds, and ever-beating Waves. \n
Ev'n when wild Tempests swallow up the Plains, \n
And Boreas' Blasts, big Hail, and Rains combine \n
To shake the Groves and Mountains, would I sit, \n
Pensively musing on th'outragious Crimes \n
That wake Heav'n's Vengeance: at such solemn Hours, \n
Dæmons and Goblins thro' the dark Air shriek, \n
While Hecat with her black-brow'd Sisters nine, \n
Rides o'er the Earth, and scatters Woes and Deaths. \n
Then too, they say, in drear Ægyptian Wilds \n
The Lion and the Tiger prowl for Prey \n
With Roarings loud! the list'ning Traveller \n
Starts Fear-struck, while the hollow-echoing Vaults \n
Of Pyramids encrease the deathful Sounds. \n
But let me never fail in cloudless Nights, \n
When silent Cynthia in her silver Car \n
Thro' the blue Concave slides, when shine the Hills, \n
Twinkle the Streams, and Woods look tipt with Gold, \n
To seek some level Mead, and there invoke \n
Old Midnight's Sister Contemplation sage, \n
(Queen of the rugged Brow, and stern-fixt Eye) \n
To lift my Soul above this little Earth, \n
This Folly-fetter'd World; to purge my Ears, \n
That I may hear the rolling Planets Song, \n
And tuneful-turning Spheres: If this debarr'd, \n
The little Fayes that dance in neighbouring Dales, \n
Sipping the Night-dew, while they laugh and love, \n
Shall charm me with a‰rial Notes. -- As thus \n
I wander musing, lo, what awful Forms \n
Yonder appear! sharp-ey'd Philosophy \n
Clad in dun Robes, an Eagle on his Wrist, \n
First meets my Eye; next, Virgin Solitude \n
Serene, who blushes at each Gazer's Sight; \n
Then Wisdom's hoary Head, with Crutch in Hand, \n
Trembling, and bent with Age; last Virtue's self \n
Smiling, in White array'd, who with her leads \n
Fair Innocence, that prattles by her Side, \n
A naked Boy! -- Harrass'd with Fear I stop, \n
I gaze, when Virtue thus -- "Whoe'er thou art, \n
"Mortal, by whom I deign to be beheld, \n
"In these my Midnight-Walks; depart, and say \n
"That henceforth I and my immortal Train \n
"Forsake Britannia's Isle; who fondly stoops \n
"To Vice, her favourite Paramour." -- She spoke, \n
And as she turn'd, her round and rosy Neck, \n
Her flowing Train, and long, ambrosial Hair, \n
Breathing rich Odours, I enamour'd view. \n
O who will bear me then to Western Climes, \n
(Since Virtue leaves our wretched Land) to Shades \n
Yet unpolluted with Iberian Swords; \n
With simple Indian Swains, that I may hunt \n
The Boar and Tiger thro' Savannah's wild? \n
There fed on Dates and Herbs, would I despise \n
The far-fetch'd Cates of Luxury, and Hoards \n
Of narrow-hearted Avarice; nor heed \n
The distant Din of the tumultuous World. \n
So when rude Whirlwinds rouze the roaring Main, \n
Beneath fair Thetis sits, in coral Caves, \n
Serenely gay, nor sinking Sailors Cries \n
Disturb her sportive Nymphs, who round her form \n
The light fantastic Dance, or for her Hair \n
Weave rosy Crowns, or with according Lutes \n
Grace the soft Warbles of her honied Voice. \n<|endoftext|>

A buzzing of the Bees, \n
As they go on their mission. \n
A cool-breese blowing in the trees. \n

Caressing the mind so intensely \n
Seemingly just to play a part \n
Or perhaps for the fun of it. \n

Sometimes deeply doth groan. \n
When by an unwillingly nature \n

nature \n
When I behold a forest spread \n
With silken trees upon thy head; \n
And when I see that other dress \n
Of flowers set in comeliness; \n
When I behold another grace \n
In the ascent of curious lace, \n
Which, like a pinnacle, doth shew \n
The top, and the top-gallant too; \n
Then, when I see thy tresses bound \n
Into an oval, square, or round, \n
And knit in knots far more than I. \n
Can tell by tongue, or True-love tie; \n
Next, when those lawny films I see \n
Play with a wild civility; \n
And all those airy silks to flow, \n
Alluring me, and tempting so-- \n
I must confess, mine eye and heart \n
Dotes less on nature than on art. \n<|endoftext|>
nature \n
As a fond mother, when the day is o'er, \n
Leads by the hand her little child to bed, \n
Half willing, half reluctant to be led, \n
And leave his broken playthings on the floor, \n
Still gazing at them through the open door, \n
Nor wholly reassured and comforted \n
By promises of others in their stead, \n
Which though more splendid, may not please him more; \n
So Nature deals with us, and takes away \n
Our playthings one by one, and by the hand \n
Leads us to rest so gently, that we go \n
Scarce knowing if we wish to go or stay, \n
Being too full of sleep to understand \n
How far the unknown transcends the what we know. \n<|endoftext|>

It is no vulgar nature I have wived. \n
Secretive, sensitive, she takes a wound \n
Deep to her soul, as if the sense had swooned, \n
And not a thought of vengeance had survived. \n
No confidences has she: but relief \n
Must come to one whose suffering is acute. \n
O have a care of natures that are mute! \n
They punish you in acts: their steps are brief. \n
What is she doing? What does she demand \n
From Providence or me? She is not one \n
Long to endure this torpidly, and shun \n
The drugs that crowd about a woman's hand. \n
At Forfeits during snow we played, and I \n
Must kiss her. 'Well performed!' I said: then she: \n
''Tis hardly worth the money, you agree?' \n
Save her? What for? To act this wedded lie! \n<|endoftext|>
nature \n
Is this a time to be cloudy and sad, \n
When our mother Nature laughs around; \n
When even the deep blue heavens look glad, \n
And gladness breathes from the blossoming ground? \n
There are notes of joy from the hang-bird and wren, \n
And the gossip of swallows through all the sky; \n
The ground-squirrel gaily chirps by his den, \n
And the wilding bee hums merrily by. \n
The clouds are at play in the azure space, \n
And their shadows at play on the bright green vale, \n
And here they stretch to the frolic chase, \n
And there they roll on the easy gale. \n
There's a dance of leaves in that aspen bower, \n
There's a titter of winds in that beechen tree, \n
There's a smile on the fruit, and a smile on the flower, \n
And a laugh from the brook that runs to the sea. \n
And look at the broad-faced sun, how he smiles \n
On the dewy earth that smiles in his ray, \n
On the leaping waters and gay young isles; \n
Ay, look, and he'll smile thy gloom away. \n<|endoftext|>

daughter \n
Seven stars in the still water, \n
And seven in the sky; \n
Seven sins on the King's daughter, \n
Deep in her soul to lie. \n
Red roses are at her feet, \n
(Roses are red in her red-gold hair) \n
And O where her bosom and girdle meet \n
Red roses are hidden there. \n
Fair is the knight who lieth slain \n
Amid the rush and reed, \n
See the lean fishes that are fain \n
Upon dead men to feed. \n
Sweet is the page that lieth there, \n
(Cloth of gold is goodly prey,) \n
See the black ravens in the air, \n
Black, O black as the night are they. \n
What do they there so stark and dead? \n
(There is blood upon her hand) \n
Why are the lilies flecked with red? \n
(There is blood on the river sand.) \n
There are two that ride from the south and east, \n
And two from the north and west, \n
For the black raven a goodly feast, \n
For the King's daughter rest. \n
There is one man who loves her true, \n
(Red, O red, is the stain of gore!) \n
He hath duggen a grave by the darksome yew, \n
(One grave will do for four.) \n
No moon in the still heaven, \n
In the black water none, \n
The sins on her soul are seven, \n
The sin upon his is one. \n<|endoftext|>
daughter \n
The dusky warriors stood in groups around the funeral pyre, \n
The scowl upon their knotted brows betrayed their vengeful ire. \n
It needed not the cords, the stake, the rites so stern and rude, \n
To tell it was to be a scene of cruelty and blood. \n
Yet ’mid those guilt-stained men could any vile enough be found \n
To harm the victim who there stood, in helpless thraldom bound? \n
A girl of slight and fragile form, of gentle child-like grace, \n
Though woman’s earnest thoughtfulness beamed in that sweet young face. \n
Oh! lovely was that winsome child of a dark and rugged line, \n
And e’en mid Europe’s daughters fair, surpassing might she shine: \n
For ne’er had coral lips been wreathed by brighter, sunnier smile, \n
Or dark eyes beamed with lustrous light, more full of winsome wile. \n
With glowing cheek and curving lip, she stood, in silent pride, \n
A queen in simple majesty, though captive bound and tied, \n
Nor could that sight of death, though fit to turn a strong heart weak, \n
Chase back the deep scorn from her brow, the color from her cheek. \n
And, yet, it was not wonderful, that haughty, high-born grace, \n
She stood amid her direst foes, a Princess of her race; \n
Knowing they’d met to wreak on her their hatred ’gainst her name, \n
To doom her to a fearful death, to pangs of fire and flame. \n
But, mindful of the teachings stern of childhood’s early years, \n
She had firmly vowed no plaints of hers, or womanish weak tears \n
Would glad her foes but, as became her rank and lineage high, \n
That she would, like a Huron maid, nobly and bravely die. \n
One moment,—then her proud glance fled, her form she humbly bowed, \n
A softened light stole o’er her brow, she prayed to heaven aloud: \n
“Hear me, Thou Great and Glorious One, Protector of my race, \n
Whom, in the far-off Spirit land, I’ll soon see face to face! \n
”Pour down Thy blessings on my tribe, may they triumphant rise \n
Above the guileful Iroquois—Thine and our enemies; \n
And give me strength to bear each pang with courage high and free, \n
That, dying thus, I may be fit to reign, oh God! with Thee.“ \n
Her prayer was ended, and again, like crowned and sceptred Queen, \n
She wore anew her lofty smile, her high and royal mien, \n
E’en though the Chief the signal gave, and quick two warriors dire, \n
Sprang forth to lead the dauntless girl to the lit funeral pyre. \n
Back, with an eye of flashing scorn, recoiled she from their grasp, \n
”Nay, touch me not, I’d rather meet the coil of poisoned asp! \n
My aged sire, and all my tribe will learn with honest pride \n
That, as befits a Huron’s child, their chieftain’s daughter died!“ \n
She dashed aside her tresses dark with bright and fearless smile, \n
And like a fawn she bounded on the fearful funeral pile; \n
And even while those blood-stained men fulfilled their cruel part \n
They praised that maiden’s courage rare, her high and dauntless heart. \n<|endoftext|>

This picture does the story express \n
Of Moses in the bulrushes. \n
How livelily the painter's hand \n
By colours makes us understand! \n
Moses that little infant is. \n
This figure is his sister. This \n
Fine stately lady is no less \n
A personage than a princess, \n
Daughter of Pharaoh, Egypt's king; \n
Whom Providence did hither bring \n
This little Hebrew child to save. \n
See how near the perilous wave \n
He lies exposëd in the ark, \n
His rushy cradle, his frail bark! \n
Pharaoh, king of Egypt land, \n
In his greatness gave command \n
To his slaves, they should destroy \n
Every new-born Hebrew boy. \n
This Moses was an Hebrew's son. \n
When he was born, his birth to none \n
His mother told, to none revealed, \n
But kept her goodly child concealed. \n
Three months she hid him; then she wrought \n
With bulrushes this ark, and brought \n
Him in it to this river's side, \n
Carefully looking far and wide \n
To see that no Egyptian eye \n
Her ark-hid treasure should espy. \n
Among the river-flags she lays \n
The child. Near him his sister stays. \n
We may imagine her affright, \n
When the king's daughter is in sight. \n
Soon the princess will perceive \n
The ark among the flags, and give \n
Command to her attendant maid \n
That its contents shall be displayed. \n
Within the ark the child is found, \n
And now he utters mournful sound. \n
Behold he weeps, as if he were \n
Afraid of cruel Egypt's heir! \n
She speaks, she says, 'This little one \n
I will protect, though he the son \n
Be of an Hebrew.' Every word \n
She speaks is by the sister heard.- \n
And now observe, this is the part \n
The painter chose to show his art. \n
Look at the sister's eager eye, \n
As here she seems advancing nigh. \n
Lowly she bends, says, 'Shall I go \n
And call a nurse to thee? I know \n
A Hebrew woman liveth near, \n
Great lady, shall I bring her here?' \n
See! Pharaoh's daughter answers, 'Go.'- \n
No more the painter's art can show. \n
He cannot make his figures move.- \n
On the light wings of swiftest love \n
The girl will fly to bring the mother \n
To be the nurse, she'll bring no other. \n
To her will Pharaoh's daughter say, \n
'Take this child from me away: \n
For wages nurse him. To my home \n
At proper age this child may come. \n
When to our palace he is brought, \n
Wise masters shall for him be sought \n
To train him up, befitting one \n
I would protect as my own son. \n
And Moses be a name unto him, \n
Because I from the waters drew him.' \n<|endoftext|>
daughter \n
In Gerald's Cottage by the hill, \n
Old Gerald and his child, \n
Innocent Maud, dwelt happily; \n
He toil'd, and she beguiled \n
The long day at her spinning-wheel, \n
In the garden now grown wild. \n
At Gerald's stroke the jay awoke; \n
Till noon hack follow'd hack, \n
Before the nearest hill had time \n
To give its echo back; \n
And evening mists were in the lane \n
Ere Gerald's arm grew slack. \n
Meanwhile, below the scented heaps \n
Of honeysuckle flower, \n
That made their simple cottage-porch \n
A cool, luxurious bower, \n
Maud sat beside her spinning-wheel, \n
And spun from hour to hour. \n
The growing thread thro' her fingers sped; \n
Round flew the polish'd wheel; \n
Merrily rang the notes she sang \n
At every finish'd reel; \n
From the hill again, like a glad refrain, \n
Follow'd the rapid peal. \n
But all is changed. The rusting axe \n
Reddens a wither'd bough; \n
A spider spins in the spinning-wheel, \n
And Maud sings wildly now; \n
And village gossips say she knows \n
Grief she may not avow. \n
Her secret's this: In the sweet age \n
When heaven's our side the lark, \n
She follow'd her old father, where \n
He work'd from dawn to dark, \n
For months, to thin the crowded groves \n
Of the old manorial Park. \n
She fancied and he felt she help'd; \n
And, whilst he hack'd and saw'd, \n
The rich Squire's son, a young boy then, \n
Whole mornings, as if awed, \n
Stood silent by, and gazed in turn \n
At Gerald and on Maud. \n
And sometimes, in a sullen tone, \n
He offer'd fruits, and she \n
Received them always with an air \n
So unreserved and free, \n
That shame-faced distance soon became \n
Familiarity. \n
Therefore in time, when Gerald shook \n
The woods, no longer coy, \n
The young heir and the cottage-girl \n
Would steal out to enjoy \n
The sound of one another's talk, \n
A simple girl and boy. \n
Spring after Spring, they took their walks \n
Uncheck'd, unquestion'd; yet \n
They learn'd to hide their wanderings \n
By wood and rivulet, \n
Because they could not give themselves \n
A reason why they met. \n
Once Maud came weeping back. ‘Poor Child!’ \n
Was all her father said: \n
And he would steady his old hand \n
Upon her hapless head, \n
And think of her as tranquilly \n
As if the child were dead. \n
But he is gone: and Maud steals out, \n
This gentle day of June; \n
And having sobb'd her pain to sleep, \n
Help'd by the stream's soft tune, \n
She rests along the willow-trunk, \n
Below the calm blue noon. \n
The shadow of her shame and her \n
Deep in the stream, behold! \n
Smiles quake over her parted lips: \n
Some thought has made her bold; \n
She stoops to dip her fingers in, \n
To feel if it be cold. \n
'Tis soft and warm, and runs as 'twere \n
Perpetually at play: \n
But then the stream, she recollects, \n
Bears everything away. \n
There is a dull pool hard at hand \n
That sleeps both night and day. \n
She marks the closing weeds that shut \n
The water from her sight; \n
They stir awhile, but now are still; \n
Her arms fall down; the light \n
Is horrible, and her countenance \n
Is pale as a cloud at night. \n
Merrily now from the small church-tower \n
Clashes a noisy chime; \n
The larks climb up thro' the heavenly blue, \n
Carolling as they climb: \n
Is it the twisting water-eft \n
That dimples the green slime? \n
The pool reflects the scarlet West \n
With a hot and guilty glow; \n
The East is changing ashy pale; \n
But Maud will never go \n
While those great bubbles struggle up \n
From the rotting weeds below. \n
The light has changed. A little since \n
You scarcely might descry \n
The moon, now gleaming sharp and bright, \n
From the small cloud slumbering nigh; \n
And, one by one, the timid stars \n
Step out into the sky. \n
The night blackens the pool; but Maud \n
Is constant at her post, \n
Sunk in a dread, unnatural sleep, \n
Beneath the skiey host \n
Of drifting mists, thro' which the moon \n
Is riding like a ghost. \n<|endoftext|>

That evening jogging on the beach with my friends \n
miles and miles away from home i was alone \n
the sea was rolling and unrolling its carpet of blue and grey \n

It was Earl Haldan's daughter, \n
She looked across the sea; \n
She looked across the water; \n
And long and loud laughed she: \n
'The locks of six princesses \n
Must be my marriage fee, \n
So hey bonny boat, and ho bonny boat! \n
Who comes a wooing me?' \n
It was Earl Haldan's daughter, \n
She walked along the sand; \n
When she was aware of a knight so fair, \n
Came sailing to the land. \n
His sails were all of velvet, \n
His mast of beaten gold, \n
And 'Hey bonny boat, and ho bonny boat! \n
Who saileth here so bold?' \n
'The locks of five princesses \n
I won beyond the sea; \n
I clipt their golden tresses, \n
To fringe a cloak for thee. \n
One handful yet is wanting, \n
But one of all the tale; \n
So hey bonny boat, and ho bonny boat! \n
Furl up thy velvet sail!' \n
He leapt into the water, \n
That rover young and bold; \n
He gript Earl Haldan's daughter, \n
He clipt her locks of gold: \n
'Go weep, go weep, proud maiden, \n
The tale is full to-day. \n
Now hey bonny boat, and ho bonny boat! \n
Sail Westward ho! away!' \n

Written in Illustration of a Tableau Vivant \n
Is she not lovely! Oh! when, long ago, \n
My own dead mother gazed upon my face, \n
As I stood blushing near in bridal snow, \n
I had not half her beauty and her grace. \n
Yet that fond mother praised, the world caressed, \n
And ONE adored me -- how shall HE who soon \n
Shall wear my gentle flower upon his breast, \n
Prize to its utmost worth the priceless boon? \n
Shall he not gird her, guard her, make her rich, \n
(Not as the world is rich, in outward show,) \n
With all the love and watchful kindness which \n
A wise and tender manhood may bestow? \n
Oh! I shall part from her with many tears, \n
My earthly treasure, pure and undefiled! \n
And not without a weight of anxious fears \n
For the new future of my darling child. \n
And yet -- for well I know that virgin heart -- \n
No wifely duty will she leave undone; \n
Nor will her love neglect that woman's art \n
Which courts and keeps a love already won. \n
In no light girlish levity she goes \n
Unto the altar where they wait her now, \n
But with a thoughtful, prayerful heart that knows \n
The solemn purport of a marriage vow. \n
And she will keep, with all her soul's deep truth, \n
The lightest pledge which binds her love and life; \n
And she will be -- no less in age than youth \n
My noble child will be -- a noble wife. \n
And he, her lover! husband! what of him? \n
Yes, he will shield, I think, my bud from blight! \n
Yet griefs will come -- enough! my eyes are dim \n
With tears I must not shed -- at least, to-night. \n
Bless thee, my daughter! -- Oh! she is so fair! -- \n
Heaven bend above thee with its starriest skies! \n

She's doen her to the Jew's castell, \n
Where a' were fast asleep: \n
'Gin ye be there, my sweet Sir Hugh, \n
I pray you to me speak.' \n
'Gae hame, gae hame, my mither dear, \n
Prepare my winding-sheet, \n
And at the back o merry Lincoln \n
The morn I will you meet.' \n
Now Lady Maisry is gane hame, \n
Make him a winding-sheet, \n
And at the back o merry Lincoln, \n
The dead corpse did her meet. \n
And a the bells o merry Lincoln \n
Without men's hands were rung, \n
And a' the books o merry Lincoln \n
Were read without man's tongue, \n
And neer was such a burial \n
Sin Adam's days begun. \n<|endoftext|>
daughter \n
Looking into my daughter’s eyes I read \n
Beneath the innocence of morning flesh \n
Concealed, hintings of death she does not heed. \n
Coldest of winds have blown this hair, and mesh \n
Of seaweed snarled these miniatures of hands; \n
The night’s slow poison, tolerant and bland, \n
Has moved her blood. Parched years that I have seen \n
That may be hers appear: foul, lingering \n
Death in certain war, the slim legs green. \n
Or, fed on hate, she relishes the sting \n
Of others’ agony; perhaps the cruel \n
Bride of a syphilitic or a fool. \n
These speculations sour in the sun. \n
I have no daughter. I desire none. \n<|endoftext|>
song \n
"Sleep, weary ones, while ye may -- \n
Sleep, oh, sleep!" \n
Eugene Field. \n
Thro' May time blossoms, with whisper low, \n
The soft wind sang to the dead below: \n
"Think not with regret on the Springtime's song \n
And the task ye left while your hands were strong. \n
The song would have ceased when the Spring was past, \n
And the task that was joyous be weary at last." \n
To the winter sky when the nights were long \n
The tree-tops tossed with a ceaseless song: \n
"Do ye think with regret on the sunny days \n
And the path ye left, with its untrod ways? \n
The sun might sink in a storm cloud's frown \n
And the path grow rough when the night came down." \n
In the grey twilight of the autumn eves, \n
It sighed as it sang through the dying leaves: \n
"Ye think with regret that the world was bright, \n
That your path was short and your task was light; \n
The path, though short, was perhaps the best \n
And the toil was sweet, that it led to rest." \n<|endoftext|>
song \n
I came to the door of the House of Love \n
And knocked as the starry night went by; \n
And my true love cried "Who knocks?" and I said \n
"It is I." \n
And Love looked down from a lattice above \n
Where the roses were dry as the lips of the dead: \n
"There is not room in the House of Love \n
For you both," he said. \n
I plucked a leaf from the porch and crept \n
Away through a desert of scoffs and scorns \n
To a lonely place where I prayed and wept \n
And wove me a crown of thorns. \n
I came once more to the House of Love \n
And knocked, ah, softly and wistfully, \n
And my true love cried "Who knocks?" and I said \n
"None now but thee." \n
And the great doors opened wide apart \n
And a voice rang out from a glory of light, \n
"Make room, make room for a faithful heart \n
In the House of Love, to-night." \n<|endoftext|>
song \n
Ornamental clouds \n
compose an evening love song; \n
a road leaves evasively. \n

we stretch out and which mingle \n
with these black horizontals. \n<|endoftext|>
song \n
I. \n
If souls could sing to heaven's high King \n
As blackbirds pipe on earth, \n
How those delicious courts would ring \n
With gusts of lovely mirth! \n
What white-robed throng could lift a song \n
So mellow with righteous glee \n
As this brown bird that all day long \n
Delights my hawthorn tree. \n
Hark! That's the thrush \n
With speckled breast \n
From yon white bush \n
Chaunting his best, \n
Te Deum! Te Deum laudamus! \n
II. \n
If earthly dreams be touched with gleams \n
Of Paradisal air, \n
Some wings, perchance, of earth may glance \n
Around our slumbers there; \n
Some breaths of may might drift our way \n
With scents of leaf and loam, \n
Some whistling bird at dawn be heard \n
From those old woods of home. \n
Hark! That's the thrush \n
With speckled breast \n
From yon white bush \n
Chaunting his best, \n
Te Deum! Te Deum laudamus! \n
III. \n
No King or priest shall mar my feast \n
Where'er my soul may range. \n
I have no fear of heaven's good cheer \n
Unless our Master change. \n
But when death's night is dying away, \n
If I might choose my bliss, \n
My love should say, at break of day, \n
With her first waking kiss:-- \n
Hark! That's the thrush \n
With speckled breast, \n
From yon white bush \n
Chaunting his best, \n
Te Deum! Te Deum laudamus! \n<|endoftext|>
song \n
Know'st thou not at the fall of the leaf \n
How the heart feels a languid grief \n
Laid on it for a covering, \n
And how sleep seems a goodly thing \n
In Autumn at the fall of the leaf? \n
And how the swift beat of the brain \n
Falters because it is in vain, \n
In Autumn at the fall of the leaf \n
Knowest thou not? and how the chief \n
Of joys seems—not to suffer pain? \n
Know'st thou not at the fall of the leaf \n
How the soul feels like a dried sheaf \n
Bound up at length for harvesting, \n
And how death seems a comely thing \n
In Autumn at the fall of the leaf? \n<|endoftext|>
song \n
I shot an arrow into the air, \n
It fell to earth, I knew not where; \n
For, so swiftly it flew, the sight \n
Could not follow it in its flight. \n
I breathed a song into the air, \n
It fell to earth, I knew not where; \n
For who has sight so keen and strong, \n
That it can follow the flight of song? \n
Long, long afterward, in an oak \n
I found the arrow, still unbroke; \n
And the song, from beginning to end, \n
I found again in the heart of a friend. \n<|endoftext|>
song \n
My love, we will go, we will go, I and you, \n
And away in the woods we will scatter the dew; \n
And the salmon behold, and the ousel too, \n
My love, we will hear, I and you, we will hear, \n
The calling afar of the doe and the deer. \n
And the bird in the branches will cry for us clear, \n
And the cuckoo unseen in his festival mood; \n
And death, oh my fair one, will never come near \n
In the bosom afar of the fragrant wood. \n<|endoftext|>
song \n
INSCRIPTION FOR AN ANTIQUE PITCHER, \n
Come, old friend! sit down and listen! \n
From the pitcher, placed between us, \n
How the waters laugh and glisten \n
In the head of old Silenus! \n
Old Silenus, bloated, drunken, \n
Led by his inebriate Satyrs; \n
On his breast his head is sunken, \n
Vacantly he leers and chatters. \n
Fauns with youthful Bacchus follow; \n
Ivy crowns that brow supernal \n
As the forehead of Apollo, \n
And possessing youth eternal. \n
Round about him, fair Bacchantes, \n
Bearing cymbals, flutes, and thyrses, \n
Wild from Naxian groves, or Zante's \n
Vineyards, sing delirious verses. \n
Thus he won, through all the nations, \n
Bloodless victories, and the farmer \n
Bore, as trophies and oblations, \n
Vines for banners, ploughs for armor. \n
Judged by no o'erzealous rigor, \n
Much this mystic throng expresses: \n
Bacchus was the type of vigor, \n
And Silenus of excesses. \n
These are ancient ethnic revels, \n
Of a faith long since forsaken; \n
Now the Satyrs, changed to devils, \n
Frighten mortals wine-o'ertaken. \n
Now to rivulets from the mountains \n
Point the rods of fortune-tellers; \n
Youth perpetual dwells in fountains; \n
Not in flasks, and casks, and cellars. \n
Claudius, though he sang of flagons \n
And huge tankards filled with Rhenish, \n
From that fiery blood of dragons \n
Never would his own replenish. \n
Even Redi, though he chaunted \n
Bacchus in the Tuscan valleys, \n
Never drank the wine he vaunted \n
In his dithyrambic sallies. \n
Then with water fill the pitcher \n
Wreathed about with classic fables, \n
Ne'er Falernian threw a richer \n
Light upon Lucullus' tables. \n
Come, old friend, sit down and listen! \n
As it passes thus between us, \n
How its wavelets laugh and glisten \n
In the head of old Silenus! \n<|endoftext|>
song \n
Over hill, over dale, \n
Thorough bush, thorough brier, \n
Over park, over pale, \n
Thorough flood, thorough fire! \n
I do wander everywhere, \n
Swifter than the moon's sphere; \n
And I serve the Fairy Queen, \n
To dew her orbs upon the green; \n
The cowslips tall her pensioners be; \n
In their gold coats spots you see; \n
Those be rubies, fairy favours; \n
In those freckles live their savours; \n
I must go seek some dewdrops here, \n
And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear. \n<|endoftext|>
song \n
Again rejoicing nature sees \n
Her robe assume its vernal hues, \n
Her leafy looks wave in the breeze, \n
All freshly steep'd in morning dews. \n
And maun I still on Menie doat, \n
And bear the scorn that's in her ee? \n
For it's jet, jet black, an' it's like a hawk, \n
An' it winna let a body be! \n
In vain to me the cowslips blaw, \n
In vain to me the vi'lets spring; \n
In vain to me, in glen or shaw, \n
The mavis and the lintwhite sing. \n
And maun I still... \n
The merry ploughboy cheers his team, \n
Wi' joy the tentie seedsman stalks, \n
But life to me 's a weary dream, \n
A dream of ane that never wauks. \n
And maun I still... \n
The wanton coot the water skims, \n
Among the reeds the ducklings cry, \n
The stately swan majestic swims, \n
And every thing is blest but I. \n
And maun I still... \n
The shepherd steeks his faulding slap, \n
And owre the moorlands whistles shill, \n
Wi' wild, unequal, wand'ring step, \n
I meet him on the dewy hill. \n
And maun I still... \n
And when the lark, 'tween light and dark, \n
Blythe waukens by the daisy's side, \n
And mounts and sings on fluttering wings, \n
A woe-worn ghaist I hameward glide. \n
And maun I still... \n
Come, Winter, with thine angry howl, \n
And raging bend the naked tree; \n
Thy gloom will soothe my cheerless soul, \n
When Nature all is sad like me! \n
And maun I still... \n<|endoftext|>
song \n
You swallowed everything, like distance. \n
Like the sea, like time. \n
In you everything sank! \n
It was the happy hour of assault and the kiss. \n

Pilot's dread, fury of a blind diver, \n
turbulent drunkenness of love, \n
in you everything sank! \n<|endoftext|>
song \n
My own dear love, he is strong and bold \n
And he cares not what comes after. \n
His words ring sweet as a chime of gold, \n
And his eyes are lit with laughter. \n
He is jubilant as a flag unfurled -- \n
Oh, a girl, she'd not forget him. \n
My own dear love, he is all my world, -- \n
And I wish I'd never met him. \n
My love, he's mad, and my love, he's fleet, \n
And a wild young wood-thing bore him! \n
The ways are fair to his roaming feet, \n
And the skies are sunlit for him. \n
As sharply sweet to my heart he seems \n
As the fragrance of acacia. \n
My own dear love, he is all my dreams, -- \n
And I wish he were in Asia. \n
My love runs by like a day in June, \n
And he makes no friends of sorrows. \n
He'll tread his galloping rigadoon \n
In the pathway of the morrows. \n
He'll live his days where the sunbeams start, \n
Nor could storm or wind uproot him. \n
My own dear love, he is all my heart, -- \n
And I wish somebody'd shoot him. \n<|endoftext|>
song \n
The princess has her lovers, \n
A score of knights has she, \n
And each can sing a madrigal, \n
And praise her gracefully. \n
But Love that is so bitter \n
Hath put within her heart \n
A longing for the scornful knight \n
Who silent stands apart. \n
And tho' the others praise and plead, \n
She maketh no reply, \n
Yet for a single word from him, \n
I ween that she would die. \n<|endoftext|>

song \n
A song of Enchantment I sang me there, \n
In a green-green wood, by waters fair, \n
Just as the words came up to me \n
I sang it under the wild wood tree. \n
Widdershins turned I, singing it low, \n
Watching the wild birds come and go; \n
No cloud in the deep dark blue to be seen \n
Under the thick-thatched branches green. \n
Twilight came: silence came: \n
The planet of Evening's silver flame; \n
By darkening paths I wandered through \n
Thickets trembling with drops of dew. \n
But the music is lost and the words are gone \n
Of the song I sang as I sat alone, \n
Ages and ages have fallen on me - \n
On the wood and the pool and the elder tree. \n<|endoftext|>
song \n
Dark, dark, lay the drifters, against the red west, \n
As they shot their long meshes of steel overside; \n
And the oily green waters were rocking to rest \n
When Kilmeny went out, at the turn of the tide. \n
And nobody knew where that lassie would roam, \n
For the magic that called her was tapping unseen. \n
It was well nigh a week ere Kilmeny came home, \n
And nobody knew hwere Kilmeny had been. \n
She'd a gun at her bow that was Newcastle's best, \n
And a gun at her stern that was fresh from the Clyde, \n
And a secret her skipper had never confessed, \n
Not even at dawn, to his newly wed bride; \n
And a wireless that whispered above like a gnome, \n
The laughter of London, the boasts of Berlin. \n
O, it may have been mermaids that lured her from home, \n
But nobody knew where Kilmeny had been. \n
It was dark when Kilmeny came home from her quest, \n
With her bridge dabbled red where her skipper had died; \n
But she moved like a bride with a rose at her breast; \n
And "Well done,Kilmeny!" the admiral cried. \n
Now at sixty-four fathom a conger may come, \n
And nose at the bones of a drowned submarine; \n
But late in the evening Kilmeny came home, \n
And nobody knew where Kilmeny had been. \n
There's a wandering shadow that stares at the foam, \n
Though they sing all night to old England, their queen, \n
Late, late in the evening Kilmeny came home, \n
And nobody knew where Kilmeny had been. \n<|endoftext|>
song \n
AFOOT and light-hearted, I take to the open road, \n
Healthy, free, the world before me, \n
The long brown path before me, leading wherever I choose. \n
Henceforth I ask not good-fortune--I myself am good fortune; \n
Henceforth I whimper no more, postpone no more, need nothing, \n
Strong and content, I travel the open road. \n
The earth--that is sufficient; \n
I do not want the constellations any nearer; \n
I know they are very well where they are; \n
I know they suffice for those who belong to them. 10 \n
(Still here I carry my old delicious burdens; \n
I carry them, men and women--I carry them with me wherever I go; \n
I swear it is impossible for me to get rid of them; \n
I am fill'd with them, and I will fill them in return.) \n
You road I enter upon and look around! I believe you are not all that \n
is here; \n
I believe that much unseen is also here. \n
Here the profound lesson of reception, neither preference or denial; \n
The black with his woolly head, the felon, the diseas'd, the \n
illiterate person, are not denied; \n
The birth, the hasting after the physician, the beggar's tramp, the \n
drunkard's stagger, the laughing party of mechanics, \n
The escaped youth, the rich person's carriage, the fop, the eloping \n
couple, 20 \n
The early market-man, the hearse, the moving of furniture into the \n
town, the return back from the town, \n
They pass--I also pass--anything passes--none can be interdicted; \n
None but are accepted--none but are dear to me. \n
You air that serves me with breath to speak! \n
You objects that call from diffusion my meanings, and give them \n
shape! \n
You light that wraps me and all things in delicate equable showers! \n
You paths worn in the irregular hollows by the roadsides! \n
I think you are latent with unseen existences--you are so dear to me. \n
You flagg'd walks of the cities! you strong curbs at the edges! \n
You ferries! you planks and posts of wharves! you timber-lined sides! \n
you distant ships! 30 \n
You rows of houses! you window-pierc'd façades! you roofs! \n
You porches and entrances! you copings and iron guards! \n
You windows whose transparent shells might expose so much! \n
You doors and ascending steps! you arches! \n
You gray stones of interminable pavements! you trodden crossings! \n
From all that has been near you, I believe you have imparted to \n
yourselves, and now would impart the same secretly to me; \n
From the living and the dead I think you have peopled your impassive \n
surfaces, and the spirits thereof would be evident and amicable \n
with me. \n
The earth expanding right hand and left hand, \n
The picture alive, every part in its best light, \n
The music falling in where it is wanted, and stopping where it is not \n
wanted, 40 \n
The cheerful voice of the public road--the gay fresh sentiment of the \n
road. \n
O highway I travel! O public road! do you say to me, Do not leave me? \n
Do you say, Venture not? If you leave me, you are lost? \n
Do you say, I am already prepared--I am well-beaten and undenied-- \n
adhere to me? \n
O public road! I say back, I am not afraid to leave you--yet I love \n
you; \n
You express me better than I can express myself; \n
You shall be more to me than my poem. \n
I think heroic deeds were all conceiv'd in the open air, and all \n
great poems also; \n
I think I could stop here myself, and do miracles; \n
(My judgments, thoughts, I henceforth try by the open air, the \n
road;) 50 \n
I think whatever I shall meet on the road I shall like, and whoever \n
beholds me shall like me; \n
I think whoever I see must be happy. \n
From this hour, freedom! \n
From this hour I ordain myself loos'd of limits and imaginary lines, \n
Going where I list, my own master, total and absolute, \n
Listening to others, and considering well what they say, \n
Pausing, searching, receiving, contemplating, \n
Gently, but with undeniable will, divesting myself of the holds that \n
would hold me. \n
I inhale great draughts of space; \n
The east and the west are mine, and the north and the south are \n
mine. 60 \n
I am larger, better than I thought; \n
I did not know I held so much goodness. \n
All seems beautiful to me; \n
I can repeat over to men and women, You have done such good to me, I \n
would do the same to you. \n
I will recruit for myself and you as I go; \n
I will scatter myself among men and women as I go; \n
I will toss the new gladness and roughness among them; \n
Whoever denies me, it shall not trouble me; \n
Whoever accepts me, he or she shall be blessed, and shall bless me. \n
Now if a thousand perfect men were to appear, it would not amaze \n
me; 70 \n
Now if a thousand beautiful forms of women appear'd, it would not \n
astonish me. \n
Now I see the secret of the making of the best persons, \n
It is to grow in the open air, and to eat and sleep with the earth. \n
Here a great personal deed has room; \n
A great deed seizes upon the hearts of the whole race of men, \n
Its effusion of strength and will overwhelms law, and mocks all \n
authority and all argument against it. \n
Here is the test of wisdom; \n
Wisdom is not finally tested in schools; \n
Wisdom cannot be pass'd from one having it, to another not having it; \n
Wisdom is of the Soul, is not susceptible of proof, is its own \n
proof, 80 \n
Applies to all stages and objects and qualities, and is content, \n
Is the certainty of the reality and immortality of things, and the \n
excellence of things; \n
Something there is in the float of the sight of things that provokes \n
it out of the Soul. \n
Now I reëxamine philosophies and religions, \n
They may prove well in lecture-rooms, yet not prove at all under the \n
spacious clouds, and along the landscape and flowing currents. \n
Here is realization; \n
Here is a man tallied--he realizes here what he has in him; \n
The past, the future, majesty, love--if they are vacant of you, you \n
are vacant of them. \n
Only the kernel of every object nourishes; \n
Where is he who tears off the husks for you and me? 90 \n
Where is he that undoes stratagems and envelopes for you and me? \n
Here is adhesiveness--it is not previously fashion'd--it is apropos; \n
Do you know what it is, as you pass, to be loved by strangers? \n
Do you know the talk of those turning eye-balls? \n
Here is the efflux of the Soul; \n
The efflux of the Soul comes from within, through embower'd gates, \n
ever provoking questions: \n
These yearnings, why are they? These thoughts in the darkness, why \n
are they? \n
Why are there men and women that while they are nigh me, the sun- \n
light expands my blood? \n
Why, when they leave me, do my pennants of joy sink flat and lank? \n
Why are there trees I never walk under, but large and melodious \n
thoughts descend upon me? 100 \n
(I think they hang there winter and summer on those trees, and always \n
drop fruit as I pass;) \n
What is it I interchange so suddenly with strangers? \n
What with some driver, as I ride on the seat by his side? \n
What with some fisherman, drawing his seine by the shore, as I walk \n
by, and pause? \n
What gives me to be free to a woman's or man's good-will? What gives \n
them to be free to mine? \n
The efflux of the Soul is happiness--here is happiness; \n
I think it pervades the open air, waiting at all times; \n
Now it flows unto us--we are rightly charged. \n
Here rises the fluid and attaching character; \n
The fluid and attaching character is the freshness and sweetness of \n
man and woman; 110 \n
(The herbs of the morning sprout no fresher and sweeter every day out \n
of the roots of themselves, than it sprouts fresh and sweet \n
continually out of itself.) \n
Toward the fluid and attaching character exudes the sweat of the love \n
of young and old; \n
From it falls distill'd the charm that mocks beauty and attainments; \n
Toward it heaves the shuddering longing ache of contact. \n
Allons! whoever you are, come travel with me! \n
Traveling with me, you find what never tires. \n
The earth never tires; \n
The earth is rude, silent, incomprehensible at first--Nature is rude \n
and incomprehensible at first; \n
Be not discouraged--keep on--there are divine things, well envelop'd; \n
I swear to you there are divine things more beautiful than words can \n
tell. 120 \n
Allons! we must not stop here! \n
However sweet these laid-up stores--however convenient this dwelling, \n
we cannot remain here; \n
However shelter'd this port, and however calm these waters, we must \n
not anchor here; \n
However welcome the hospitality that surrounds us, we are permitted \n
to receive it but a little while. \n
Allons! the inducements shall be greater; \n
We will sail pathless and wild seas; \n
We will go where winds blow, waves dash, and the Yankee clipper \n
speeds by under full sail. \n
Allons! with power, liberty, the earth, the elements! \n
Health, defiance, gayety, self-esteem, curiosity; \n
Allons! from all formules! 130 \n
From your formules, O bat-eyed and materialistic priests! \n
The stale cadaver blocks up the passage--the burial waits no longer. \n
Allons! yet take warning! \n
He traveling with me needs the best blood, thews, endurance; \n
None may come to the trial, till he or she bring courage and health. \n
Come not here if you have already spent the best of yourself; \n
Only those may come, who come in sweet and determin'd bodies; \n
No diseas'd person--no rum-drinker or venereal taint is permitted \n
here. \n
I and mine do not convince by arguments, similes, rhymes; \n
We convince by our presence. 140 \n
Listen! I will be honest with you; \n
I do not offer the old smooth prizes, but offer rough new prizes; \n
These are the days that must happen to you: \n
You shall not heap up what is call'd riches, \n
You shall scatter with lavish hand all that you earn or achieve, \n
You but arrive at the city to which you were destin'd--you hardly \n
settle yourself to satisfaction, before you are call'd by an \n
irresistible call to depart, \n
You shall be treated to the ironical smiles and mockings of those who \n
remain behind you; \n
What beckonings of love you receive, you shall only answer with \n
passionate kisses of parting, \n
You shall not allow the hold of those who spread their reach'd hands \n
toward you. \n
Allons! after the GREAT COMPANIONS! and to belong to them! 150 \n
They too are on the road! they are the swift and majestic men; they \n
are the greatest women. \n
Over that which hinder'd them--over that which retarded--passing \n
impediments large or small, \n
Committers of crimes, committers of many beautiful virtues, \n
Enjoyers of calms of seas, and storms of seas, \n
Sailors of many a ship, walkers of many a mile of land, \n
Habitués of many distant countries, habitués of far-distant dwellings, \n
Trusters of men and women, observers of cities, solitary toilers, \n
Pausers and contemplators of tufts, blossoms, shells of the shore, \n
Dancers at wedding-dances, kissers of brides, tender helpers of \n
children, bearers of children, \n
Soldiers of revolts, standers by gaping graves, lowerers down of \n
coffins, 160 \n
Journeyers over consecutive seasons, over the years--the curious \n
years, each emerging from that which preceded it, \n
Journeyers as with companions, namely, their own diverse phases, \n
Forth-steppers from the latent unrealized baby-days, \n
Journeyers gayly with their own youth--Journeyers with their bearded \n
and well-grain'd manhood, \n
Journeyers with their womanhood, ample, unsurpass'd, content, \n
Journeyers with their own sublime old age of manhood or womanhood, \n
Old age, calm, expanded, broad with the haughty breadth of the \n
universe, \n
Old age, flowing free with the delicious near-by freedom of death. \n
Allons! to that which is endless, as it was beginningless, \n
To undergo much, tramps of days, rests of nights, 170 \n
To merge all in the travel they tend to, and the days and nights they \n
tend to, \n
Again to merge them in the start of superior journeys; \n
To see nothing anywhere but what you may reach it and pass it, \n
To conceive no time, however distant, but what you may reach it and \n
pass it, \n
To look up or down no road but it stretches and waits for you-- \n
however long, but it stretches and waits for you; \n
To see no being, not God's or any, but you also go thither, \n
To see no possession but you may possess it--enjoying all without \n
labor or purchase--abstracting the feast, yet not abstracting \n
one particle of it; \n
To take the best of the farmer's farm and the rich man's elegant \n
villa, and the chaste blessings of the well-married couple, and \n
the fruits of orchards and flowers of gardens, \n
To take to your use out of the compact cities as you pass through, \n
To carry buildings and streets with you afterward wherever you \n
go, 180 \n
To gather the minds of men out of their brains as you encounter \n
them--to gather the love out of their hearts, \n
To take your lovers on the road with you, for all that you leave them \n
behind you, \n
To know the universe itself as a road--as many roads--as roads for \n
traveling souls. \n
The Soul travels; \n
The body does not travel as much as the soul; \n
The body has just as great a work as the soul, and parts away at last \n
for the journeys of the soul. \n
All parts away for the progress of souls; \n
All religion, all solid things, arts, governments,--all that was or \n
is apparent upon this globe or any globe, falls into niches and \n
corners before the procession of Souls along the grand roads of \n
the universe. \n
Of the progress of the souls of men and women along the grand roads \n
of the universe, all other progress is the needed emblem and \n
sustenance. \n
Forever alive, forever forward, 190 \n
Stately, solemn, sad, withdrawn, baffled, mad, turbulent, feeble, \n
dissatisfied, \n
Desperate, proud, fond, sick, accepted by men, rejected by men, \n
They go! they go! I know that they go, but I know not where they go; \n
But I know that they go toward the best--toward something great. \n
Allons! whoever you are! come forth! \n
You must not stay sleeping and dallying there in the house, though \n
you built it, or though it has been built for you. \n
Allons! out of the dark confinement! \n
It is useless to protest--I know all, and expose it. \n
Behold, through you as bad as the rest, \n
Through the laughter, dancing, dining, supping, of people, 200 \n
Inside of dresses and ornaments, inside of those wash'd and trimm'd \n
faces, \n
Behold a secret silent loathing and despair. \n
No husband, no wife, no friend, trusted to hear the confession; \n
Another self, a duplicate of every one, skulking and hiding it goes, \n
Formless and wordless through the streets of the cities, polite and \n
bland in the parlors, \n
In the cars of rail-roads, in steamboats, in the public assembly, \n
Home to the houses of men and women, at the table, in the bed-room, \n
everywhere, \n
Smartly attired, countenance smiling, form upright, death under the \n
breast-bones, hell under the skull-bones, \n
Under the broadcloth and gloves, under the ribbons and artificial \n
flowers, \n
Keeping fair with the customs, speaking not a syllable of itself, 210 \n
Speaking of anything else, but never of itself. \n
Allons! through struggles and wars! \n
The goal that was named cannot be countermanded. \n
Have the past struggles succeeded? \n
What has succeeded? yourself? your nation? nature? \n
Now understand me well--It is provided in the essence of things, that \n
from any fruition of success, no matter what, shall come forth \n
something to make a greater struggle necessary. \n
My call is the call of battle--I nourish active rebellion; \n
He going with me must go well arm'd; \n
He going with me goes often with spare diet, poverty, angry enemies, \n
desertions. \n
Allons! the road is before us! 220 \n
It is safe--I have tried it--my own feet have tried it well. \n
Allons! be not detain'd! \n
Let the paper remain on the desk unwritten, and the book on the shelf unopen'd! \n
Let the tools remain in the workshop! let the money remain unearn'd! \n
Let the school stand! mind not the cry of the teacher! \n
Let the preacher preach in his pulpit! let the lawyer plead in the court, and the judge expound the law. \n
Mon enfant! I give you my hand! \n
I give you my love, more precious than money, \n
I give you myself, before preaching or law; \n
Will you give me yourself? will you come travel with me? 230 \n
Shall we stick by each other as long as we live? \n<|endoftext|>

And the grasshopper laughs in the merry scene, \n
When Mary and Susan and Emily \n
With their sweet round mouths sing 'Ha, ha he!' \n
When the painted birds laugh in the shade, \n
Where our table with cherries and nuts is spread: \n
Come live, and be merry, and join with me, \n
To sing the sweet chorus of 'Ha, ha, he!' \n<|endoftext|>

money \n
My belly aches for precious food \n
my androgens are in the mood, \n
one foot already in the grave \n
the other one acts rather brave. \n
Each calendar does lie a bit \n
and one has placed me in the shit. \n
A silver lining in my hair \n
and shaped I am just like a pear. \n
So many early warning wrinkles \n
and endless, unproductive tinkles, \n
some clerks now dare to call me dear \n
a wonder that I still can hear. \n
I see my cute optometrist \n
with glassy eyes, inside the mist \n
and when I pay for groceries \n
I reach and take the first green peace \n
out of the wallet, giving gladly, \n
my sight has sunk to 'rather badly', \n
it is my cottonpickin head \n
that wants to keep from being dead. \n
I pay the charlatan and quack \n
to feed me pills and fix my back. \n
While longing for longevity \n
I do forget that one small key \n
has been created for my soul \n
when God designed it to a role. \n
But, never one to listen much \n
I aim to commandeer a touch \n
of real immortality \n
all for a lousy service fee. \n
And when I'm down to my last coin \n
and angels beckon me to join \n
I'll have no choice and will not care \n
and, like a blinded forest hare \n
I do remain in place and freeze \n
then give the world a final sneeze. \n
I think the words above might say \n
it matters not what we can pay \n
and that we would be well advised \n
not to be cut or analysed. \n
There comes a time when your own number \n
unlocks the door to endless slumber. \n
So I shall keep my hard-earned cash \n
by now it is a hefty stash. \n
And take it to the Never-Never \n
a move that labels me as clever. \n
So, having been on earth a scrooge \n
the benefits shall be quite huge. \n
Make-over for the mind and bod \n
and pay the man, in this case, God. \n<|endoftext|>

indivduals inject the money dope into there vains \n

people who lack it want it \n

money is infatuation it can bring you sex from a whore \n
but it blinds you from the ones you should adore \n
it affects brain it brings stress to your state of mind, it leaves your head with a receeded hair line \n
it pollutes the world because money is toxicity, it causes you to over eat and it leaves you with obesity \n
it can be a stab in the back a kick in the ass, it can leave you in the street wishin you were in the past \n
it produces greed it plants the seed of something you cant live without and something you need \n
it speaks every language and its never ignored, we give money to the church because they say its for the lord \n
thats bullshit, if in worship we are the performers, and God is the audience that we see, shouldnt worship be free? \n
survival of the fittest in this time people are working from 9 to 5 for the nickel dime \n
a cancer in society a false form piety \n
a fake form of religion shared by the royalty with an undying loyalty \n
without it you have fear of where are you going to be next year \n
gives you a sense of importance that you can sit but really your nothing but a piece of shit \n
money creates a nation that divides within a class you reside with the rules that you have to abide \n

Watch your world spin & rock \n
Money talks \n
But when it fucks with you \n
Money sucks \n

With money, you are my property \n

Chasing you from block to block \n
The previous known vagabond \n
People now no longer mock \n
You ceased being a laughing stock \n
Now they want a share of your buck \n
Ignoring money talk, is not that simple \n
Many have thrown away their principles \n
Listening to money talk \n
It is the master of love & hate \n
It is the master of a smile & a frown \n
It is the master of respect & disrespect \n
It’s the difference between a good & a bad friend \n
Money talks \n
If you listen to it \n
You become its slave \n
The only path it paves \n
Waits silently to crush you \n
With an evil gigantic wave \n

money \n
I’m delighted by the velocity of money as it whistles through the windows \n
of Lower East Side \n
Delighted by skyscrapers rising the old grungy apartments falling on \n
84th Street \n
Delighted by inflation that drives me out on the street \n
After all what good’s the family farm, why eat turkey by thousands every \n
Thanksgiving? \n
Why not have Star Wars? Why have the same old America?!? \n
George Washington wasn’t good enough! Tom Paine pain in the neck, \n
Whitman what a jerk! \n
I’m delighted by double digit interest rates in the Capitalist world \n
I always was a communist, now we’ll win \n
an usury makes the walls thinner, books thicker & dumber \n
Usury makes my poetry more valuable \n
my manuscripts worth their weight in useless gold - \n
Now everybody’s atheist like me, nothing’s sacred \n
buy and sell your grandmother, eat up old age homes, \n
Peddle babies on the street, pretty boys for sale on Times Square - \n
You can shoot heroin, I can sniff cocaine, \n
macho men can fite on the Nicaraguan border and get paid with paper! \n
The velocity’s what counts as the National Debt gets higher \n
Everybody running after the rising dollar \n
Crowds of joggers down broadway past City Hall on the way to the Fed \n
Nobody reads Dostoyevsky books so they’ll have to give a passing ear \n
to my fragmented ravings in between President’s speeches \n
Nothing’s happening but the collapse of the Economy \n
so I can go back to sleep till the landlord wins his eviction suit in court. \n<|endoftext|>

Could it be possible to live without money? \n
Why can’t man live without money in the world? \n
Long back I saw an African movie about this; \n
It is called “Gods Must Be Crazy! ” \n
One can get the idea to live without money! \n
Even today people are living life in farm houses \n
Far away from the civilised world of materialism \n
Without needing money for any purpose there! \n
In the forest and farm houses far away from towns \n
Life of the people needs no money at all it seems! \n
We can live without money but not without hunger! \n
Nature has given hunger and also all things to survive; \n
It is man’s own creation to live as slaves of comforts \n
In the world where nothing is permanent in time bound life! \n<|endoftext|>

He is sixty his hair dyed brown and she is a natural blond of nineteen \n
And strolling hand in hand along the beach road every evening they are seen \n
His grandchildren as old as she is it is so true what they say \n
That money does speak every language and it has always been this way. \n
In a World where money matters men of money seem to rule \n
And with a rolls royce in his garage and an indoor heated swimming pool \n
She must see him as a good catch though he is years beyond his prime \n
And he is smitten by her beauty and he buys her a good time. \n
One less attractive young woman for to woo for the single young males of the town \n
For the fellow in his sixties she has turned all suitors down \n
Those who say love only matters must believe in their own lie \n
She has knocked back men of her own age for to be with the wealthy older guy. \n
To those who talk of love and passion pay no heed to what they say \n
For in a World where money matters the sugar daddy leads the way \n
To find himself a young beauty he doesn't even have to try \n
For in a World where money matters there's little money cannot buy. \n
He is sixty his hair dyed brown and he goes walking hand in hand \n
With a young beauty of nineteen and that's not hard to understand \n
For in a World where money matters he is a known millionaire \n
And the young males of him jealous doesn't life seem very unfair? \n<|endoftext|>

laughter \n
The sound of laughter is a thing of beauty for laughter spreads the very gift of joy \n
That people they are drawn to happy people is not that hard for to understand why \n
Since everybody wishes to be happy and laughter it spreads happiness around \n
And only the heartless could not like the sound of laughter for laughter is a very happy sound, \n
Than laughter there is no more happy feeling laugh and the World laughs with you seems so true \n
But if you feel sad and for yourself feeling sorry the saddest person in the World is you \n
Even your friends would rather not be with you if they see you as one who worship gloom \n
The happy people attract people to them and in their presence happiness does bloom, \n
The sound of laughter sends out laughter ripples it is a sound one always loves to hear \n
And laughter it gives rise to smiling faces and never fails to fill the cup of cheer \n
The sad one who feels comfort in self pity is the one others do not wish to know \n
But if you are one who laughs away your worries your friends in numbers seem to grow and grow \n
And who could not but love the sound of laughter to it there always is a joyful ring \n
It seems to send happiness out in ripples it is a joyful and infectious thing. \n<|endoftext|>
laughter \n
If we can laugh, our heart-aches disappear! \n
Our minds become freed off tensions and stress; \n
If we make others laugh, they lose their fear, \n
And become dear, starting to us caress. \n
Laughter is good for both the young and old; \n
Laughter can turn a foe into a friend; \n
Laughter can help forget our woes, be bold; \n
Laughter can bring to grief, an early end. \n
Laughter is life’s most precious medicine; \n
Laughter is soothing balm for all our ills; \n
Laughter is euphoric much more than wine, \n
Causing no harm to one/ increasing bills. \n
Then laugh and be merry, whenever you can, \n
For, that’s the way to live life better, man. \n<|endoftext|>
laughter \n
The children are playing football in the park off of the street \n
The joy in their laughter it does sound so sweet \n
'Tis true youth is such a marvellous thing \n
Like the flowers of the fields that bloom lovely in Spring. \n
The joy of their laughter bring back memories to me \n
Of happy boyhood days of any cares free \n
In the Town park on Summer evenings we kicked the football \n
Such wonderful memories are good to recall \n
The years went so quickly and time did not wait \n
And I've grown grayer and slower and I'm putting on weight \n
The future belongs to the youth of today \n
Though they too will grow to learn that time quickly ticks away. \n
Some of those I went to school with now with the dead lay \n
And some are grand parents and their grand children play \n
The games they themselves played they run up and down \n
In pursuit of the football in the park by the Town. \n
As I walk to the bottle shop for to buy beer \n
The laughter of the children playing football I hear \n
Their best days approaching and mine in the past \n
But time keeps on ticking and nothing does last. \n<|endoftext|>

laughter \n
I love to get a dance right. \n
When a dance does go wrong \n
makes me laugh uncontrollably. \n
I hold my sides - \n
I am convulsed with laughter, \n
I am literally paralyzed, \n
I see people befuddled, \n
looking utterly lost. \n
they are wandering around aimlessly, \n
or rooted to the spot \n
like a deer caught in headlights. \n
No joke makes me laugh uncontrollably. \n
Yes, I may guffaw, I may laugh - \n
but uncontrollable laughter, \n
deep purging, \n
healing laughter, \n
happens very-very seldom in my life. \n
But it happened in my last dance. \n
I was convulsed with laughter - \n
convulsed is the only correct word. \n
How often, in life, are you convulsed in laughter? - \n
and of course, being convulsed, \n
I was clogging up the middle, \n
causing further confusion. \n<|endoftext|>
laughter \n
Laughter makes merry— \n
It’s good for your health. \n
And pausing to laugh \n
Brings “physical' wealth. \n
It releases endorphins \n
(Stored in the brain) , \n
And builds up cells \n
To combat the pain. \n
So when life bites \n
And problems sting, \n
Open up your heart \n
And let laughter ring. \n

Your Laughter \n
Original Poem by Pablo Neruda \n
Hindi translation by Rajnish Manga \n
laughter \n
Not with libations, but with shouts and laughter \n
We drenched the altars of Love's sacred grove, \n
Shaking to earth green fruits, impatient after \n
The launching of the colored moths of Love. \n
Love's proper myrtle and his mother's zone \n
We bound about our irreligious brows, \n
And fettered him with garlands of our own, \n
And spread a banquet in his frugal house. \n
Not yet the god has spoken; but I fear \n
Though we should break our bodies in his flame, \n
And pour our blood upon his altar, here \n
Henceforward is a grove without a name, \n
A pasture to the shaggy goats of Pan, \n
Whence flee forever a woman and a man. \n<|endoftext|>

Hold not thy laughter \n
For that joyful sound \n
I am forever after, seeking when you are around \n
Waiting for it to chortle, in the background \n
Hold not thy laughter \n
As it fights to escapes thy lips \n
To send me on joyful trips \n
Your giggles and cackles \n
Harmlessly tend to baffle \n
Your happy facial expressions \n
Paint only a gleeful picture of inspiration \n
As we rejoice to thy jubilant noises in full attention \n
Hold not thy laughter from the heart \n
Hold not thy laughter until we part \n
Hold not thy laughter as we make a start \n
When I dispel in my gloom \n
Thy laughter delivers me \n
Safely from my state of doom \n
Sadness runs outside from my room \n
Happiness inside glows with a boom \n
As my rosy cheeks mirthfully blossom \n
Hold not thy laughter as we cheerfully chat \n
Hold not thy laughter when you publicly fart \n
Hold not thy laughter whatever the format \n
A giggle, a chuckle, a titter not a snigger \n
Laugh it out whether thin or fat \n
Fill the air, my dear \n
Laugh it out before it scats out flat \n

'Laughter is the best medicine, ' \n
To everyone, this is well known, \n
But now-a-days, it's rarely seen \n
'Cause of more stress and strain. \n
In the good olden days, \n
There were royal ways, \n
For a king's laughter, \n
Got thro' a Court Jester. \n
To a Joker's club, \n
Or a Theatre pub, \n
One has to go today, \n
For buying one's joy. \n
Anger leads one to tension, \n
And laughter to relaxation, \n
But still why one chooses frustration, \n
Paying health a little attention? \n
It's said, 'An apple a day \n
Keeps the doctor away, ' \n
Why a free-laugh, daily one can't try, \n
Rather going for an apple to buy? \n
This way one can be happy, \n
To lead a long life healthy, \n
And can grow further wealthy, \n
No more medicines, no more worry. \n<|endoftext|>

memory \n
When I look upon a photograph. \n
Not so long ago, not so faded. \n
A picture of my beloved big brother. \n
The memories had filled my mind. \n
The times we cried and the times we laughed. \n
How brother watches over me, \n
Makes sure I'm not hurt. \n
When I was sick, he made my lunch. \n
We'd go on shopping trips. \n
We thought we would grow old together. \n
Through the years we thought it was true. \n
Brother and I worked on model trains. \n
Then time had come to call. \n
My big brother had to go. \n
He passed away, he went to eternal sleep. \n
God is holding him as he sleeps. \n
Until he comes to call. \n
All I have are memories and a photograph. \n
In memory of big brother Paul. \n<|endoftext|>
memory \n
Now that we're almost settled in our house \n
I'll name the friends that cannot sup with us \n
Beside a fire of turf in th' ancient tower, \n
And having talked to some late hour \n
Climb up the narrow winding stairs to bed: \n
Discoverers of forgotten truth \n
Or mere companions of my youth, \n
All, all are in my thoughts to-night being dead. \n
Always we'd have the new friend meet the old \n
And we are hurt if either friend seem cold, \n
And there is salt to lengthen out the smart \n
In the affections of our heart, \n
And quarrels are blown up upon that head; \n
But not a friend that I would bring \n
This night can set us quarrelling, \n
For all that come into my mind are dead. \n
Lionel Johnson comes the first to mind, \n
That loved his learning better than mankind. \n
Though courteous to the worst; much falling he \n
Brooded upon sanctity \n
Till all his Greek and Latin learning seemed \n
A long blast upon the horn that brought \n
A little nearer to his thought \n
A measureless consummation that he dreamed. \n
And that enquiring man John Synge comes next, \n
That dying chose the living world for text \n
And never could have rested in the tomb \n
But that, long travelling, he had come \n
Towards nightfall upon certain set apart \n
In a most desolate stony place, \n
Towards nightfall upon a race \n
Passionate and simple like his heart. \n
And then I think of old George Pollexfen, \n
In muscular youth well known to Mayo men \n
For horsemanship at meets or at racecourses, \n
That could have shown how pure-bred horses \n
And solid men, for all their passion, live \n
But as the outrageous stars incline \n
By opposition, square and trine; \n
Having grown sluggish and contemplative. \n
They were my close companions many a year. \n
A portion of my mind and life, as it were, \n
And now their breathless faces seem to look \n
Out of some old picture-book; \n
I am accustomed to their lack of breath, \n
But not that my dear friend's dear son, \n
Our Sidney and our perfect man, \n
Could share in that discourtesy of death. \n
For all things the delighted eye now sees \n
Were loved by him: the old storm-broken trees \n
That cast their shadows upon road and bridge; \n
The tower set on the stream's edge; \n
The ford where drinking cattle make a stir \n
Nightly, and startled by that sound \n
The water-hen must change her ground; \n
He might have been your heartiest welcomer. \n
When with the Galway foxhounds he would ride \n
From Castle Taylor to the Roxborough side \n
Or Esserkelly plain, few kept his pace; \n
At Mooneen he had leaped a place \n
So perilous that half the astonished meet \n
Had shut their eyes; and where was it \n
He rode a race without a bit? \n
And yet his mind outran the horses' feet. \n
We dreamed that a great painter had been born \n
To cold Clare rock and Galway rock and thorn, \n
To that stern colour and that delicate line \n
That are our secret discipline \n
Wherein the gazing heart doubles her might. \n
Soldier, scholar, horseman, he, \n
And yet he had the intensity \n
To have published all to be a world's delight. \n
What other could so well have counselled us \n
In all lovely intricacies of a house \n
As he that practised or that understood \n
All work in metal or in wood, \n
In moulded plaster or in carven stone? \n
Soldier, scholar, horseman, he, \n
And all he did done perfectly \n
As though he had but that one trade alone. \n
Some burn damp faggots, others may consume \n
The entire combustible world in one small room \n
As though dried straw, and if we turn about \n
The bare chimney is gone black out \n
Because the work had finished in that flare. \n
Soldier, scholar, horseman, he, \n
As 'twere all life's epitome. \n
What made us dream that he could comb grey hair? \n
I had thought, seeing how bitter is that wind \n
That shakes the shutter, to have brought to mind \n
All those that manhood tried, or childhood loved \n
Or boyish intellect approved, \n
With some appropriatc commentary on each; \n
Until imagination brought \n
A fitter welcome; but a thought \n
Of that late death took all my heart for speech. \n<|endoftext|>
memory \n
To finger-sponge crust crumbs of fruit meringue \n
(Grass prickling through the blanket-tablecloth); \n
To climb the shading oak; to roll and hang \n
Inverted from a branch, as if a sloth; \n
And, after dropping neatly from the branch, \n
To pull a cup off of a tube of cups; \n
To grab a towel hurriedly to stanch \n
A soda which, on opening, erupts— \n
This was to be there thirty years ago, \n
A time constrained and hurtful, yet the day \n
Now has the settled warmth of a tableau. \n
Cloud stacks stand whitely, farmlands stretch away, \n
While her two brothers, in a make-believe \n
World Series, wave their baseball gloves and run \n
About the meadow as they stab and heave \n
Each other blinding high-flies in the sun. \n
Her uncle, to distract and to compose \n
An argument between his daughters, lies \n
Upon his back and eye-catchingly blows \n
Smoke rings which grayly loosen as they rise. \n
Her parents will divorce within a year, \n
But neither fully grasps the crisis yet: \n
They kneel and wrap leftovers and appear \n
Absorbed in a congenial tête-à-tête. \n
And she can walk the meadow at her ease, \n
Switching the tall grass with an osier wand; \n
Can hear the white-throats in the woods reprise \n
The long rich notes with which they correspond; \n
Can spread and duck through a barbed wire fence; \n
Can sit on, horseback style, a fallen tree \n
While grasshoppers perform leaps so immense \n
They seem beyond the claims of gravity. \n
This idyll will be, she intuits, brief; \n
The fabric of the family will tear. \n
Yet this can't change the bittersweet belief \n
That pleasure's no less true for being rare; \n
Nor can it wholly undermine her sense \n
That though well-muscled follies hound and press, \n
What counts most is her own intelligence, \n
However cramped by grief and loneliness. \n
And even now, a cousin waves to her \n
And blows a summons through a trumpet-fist: \n
She's off to pick wildflowers and would prefer \n
To do so with a comrade botanist. \n
Investigating where the field declines \n
To marsh land, the two harvest or reprieve \n
Pinks, yellow bells, and long-spurred columbines \n
Till voices call them that it's time to leave. \n
Regretting his departure from the wild, \n
A stuffed bear's carried off; the sun moves west; \n
Her aunt holds on her hip her youngest child; \n
The slushed ice is dumped brusquely from its chest. \n
Caps are screwed back on thermoses and jars; \n
Her two ball-playing brothers pool their talents, \n
Porting between them a hamper to the cars, \n
Their outer arms held straining out for balance. \n
And if the meadows grow more darkly gold, \n
As though withdrawing now from living fact, \n
The blanket brushed, she and her mother fold \n
It up in squares increasingly compact. \n
She shinnies out the oak to roll and swing \n
A last time underneath the limb's rough girth, \n
Then hangs by hands, and lets go, fathoming \n
The distance of her drop back to the earth. \n<|endoftext|>
memory \n
Farewell, too little and too lately known, \n
Whom I began to think and call my own; \n
For sure our souls were near allied, and thine \n
Cast in the same poetic mould with mine. \n
One common note on either lyre did strike, \n
And knaves and fools we both abhorred alike. \n
To the same goal did both our studies drive; \n
The last set out the soonest did arrive. \n
Thus Nisus fell upon the slippery place, \n
While his young friend performed and won the race. \n
O early ripe! to thy abundant store \n
What could advancing age have added more? \n
It might (what Nature never gives the young) \n
Have taught the numbers of thy native tongue. \n
But satire needs not those, and wit will shine \n
Through the harsh cadence of a rugged line. \n
A noble error, and but seldom made, \n
When poets are by too much force betrayed. \n
Thy generous fruits, though gathered ere their prime, \n
Still showed a quickness; and maturing time \n
But mellows what we write to the dull sweets of rhyme. \n
Once more, hail and farewell! farewell, thou young, \n
But ah too short, Marcellus of our tongue! \n
Thy brows with ivy and with laurels bound; \n
But fate and gloomy night encompass thee around. \n<|endoftext|>
memory \n
FIVE-AND-TWENTY years have gone \n
Since old William pollexfen \n
Laid his strong bones down in death \n
By his wife Elizabeth \n
In the grey stone tomb he made. \n
And after twenty years they laid \n
In that tomb by him and her \n
His son George, the astrologer; \n
And Masons drove from miles away \n
To scatter the Acacia spray \n
Upon a melancholy man \n
Who had ended where his breath began. \n
Many a son and daughter lies \n
Far from the customary skies, \n
The Mall and Eades's grammar school, \n
In London or in Liverpool; \n
But where is laid the sailor John \n
That so many lands had known, \n
Quiet lands or unquiet seas \n
Where the Indians trade or Japanese? \n
He never found his rest ashore, \n
Moping for one voyage more. \n
Where have they laid the sailor John? \n
And yesterday the youngest son, \n
A humorous, unambitious man, \n
Was buried near the astrologer, \n
Yesterday in the tenth year \n
Since he who had been contented long. \n
A nobody in a great throng, \n
Decided he would journey home, \n
Now that his fiftieth year had come, \n
And 'Mr. Alfred' be again \n
Upon the lips of common men \n
Who carried in their memory \n
His childhood and his family. \n
At all these death-beds women heard \n
A visionary white sea-bird \n
Lamenting that a man should die; \n
And with that cry I have raised my cry. \n<|endoftext|>
memory \n
You are but a memory to my dear heart \n
that dwindles as each day passes me by. \n
My heart yearns for you, but you're not there, \n
only your memory is, and that hurts even more. \n
The tears are all too real and they follow the pain \n
my heart feels when it misses you so. \n
Memory upon memory floods the gates \n
and soon I begin to drown in them. \n
Each better than the last but all so sweet and real. \n
The memory is real but its fading too fast \n
its uncontrolable, and its evaporating \n
like dew drops in the sun. \n
I try to gather them up quickly, place them in a jar, but \n
the time is quicker than I, and it speeds up the sun's steal. \n
O I wish you could be here and not just your memory \n
because you are by far better than the thought of the past. \n
As each sunset brings forth a new day, \n
I think about the memory, and the pain it brings \n
is too immense but the tears are even bigger. \n
You are but a memory that is quickly fading \n
and only you can fix that my dear. \n
Though my heart hurts so much from the pain \n
only you can save me. \n
Like each sunset brings forth a new time, \n
this sunset will bring you to me. \n
And love back into the mourning heart \n<|endoftext|>
memory \n
I \n
In Casterbridge there stood a noble pile, \n
Wrought with pilaster, bay, and balustrade \n
In tactful times when shrewd Eliza swayed. - \n
On burgher, squire, and clown \n
It smiled the long street down for near a mile \n
II \n
But evil days beset that domicile; \n
The stately beauties of its roof and wall \n
Passed into sordid hands. Condemned to fall \n
Were cornice, quoin, and cove, \n
And all that art had wove in antique style. \n
III \n
Among the hired dismantlers entered there \n
One till the moment of his task untold. \n
When charged therewith he gazed, and answered bold: \n
"Be needy I or no, \n
I will not help lay low a house so fair! \n
IV \n
"Hunger is hard. But since the terms be such - \n
No wage, or labour stained with the disgrace \n
Of wrecking what our age cannot replace \n
To save its tasteless soul - \n
I'll do without your dole. Life is not much! \n
V \n
Dismissed with sneers he backed his tools and went, \n
And wandered workless; for it seemed unwise \n
To close with one who dared to criticize \n
And carp on points of taste: \n
To work where they were placed rude men were meant. \n
VI \n
Years whiled. He aged, sank, sickened, and was not: \n
And it was said, "A man intractable \n
And curst is gone." None sighed to hear his knell, \n
None sought his churchyard-place; \n
His name, his rugged face, were soon forgot. \n
VII \n
The stones of that fair hall lie far and wide, \n
And but a few recall its ancient mould; \n
Yet when I pass the spot I long to hold \n
As truth what fancy saith: \n
"His protest lives where deathless things abide!" \n<|endoftext|>
memory \n
Divorced, but friends again at last, \n
we walk old ground together \n
in bright blue uncomplicated weather. \n
We laugh and pause \n
to hack to bits these tiny dinosaurs, \n
prehistoric, crenelated, cast \n
between the tractor ruts in mud. \n
On the green, a junior Douglas Fairbanks, \n
swinging on the chestnut's unlit chandelier, \n
defies the corporation spears-- \n
a single rank around the bole, \n
rusty with blood. \n
Green, tacky phalluses curve up, romance \n
A gust--the old flag blazes on its pole. \n
In the village bakery \n
the pastry babies pass \n
from milky slump to crusty cadaver, \n
from crib to coffin--without palaver. \n
All's over in a flash, \n
too silently... \n
Tonight the arum lilies fold \n
back napkins monogrammed in gold, \n
crisp and laundered fresh. \n
Those crustaceous gladioli, on the sly, \n
reveal the crimson flower-flesh \n
inside their emerald armor plate. \n
The uncooked herrings blink a tearful eye. \n
The candles palpitate. \n
The Oistrakhs bow and scrape \n
in evening dress, on Emi-tape. \n
Outside the trees are bending over backwards \n
to please the wind : the shining sword \n
grass flattens on its belly. \n
The white-thorn's frillies offer no resistance. \n
In the fridge, a heart-shaped jelly \n
strives to keep a sense of balance. \n
I slice up the onions. You sew up a dress. \n
This is the quiet echo--flesh-- \n
white muscle on white muscle, \n
intimately folded skin, \n
finished with a satin rustle. \n
One button only to undo, sewn up with shabby thread. \n
It is the onion, memory, \n
that makes me cry. \n
Because there's everything and nothing to be said, \n
the clock with hands held up before its face, \n
stammers softly on, trying to complete a phrase-- \n
while we, together and apart, \n
repeat unfinished festures got by heart. \n
And afterwards, I blunder with the washing on the line-- \n
headless torsos, faceless lovers, friends of mine. \n<|endoftext|>
memory \n
Thou youngest virgin-daughter of the skies, \n
Made in the last promotion of the Blest; \n
Whose palms, new pluck'd from Paradise, \n
In spreading branches more sublimely rise, \n
Rich with immortal green above the rest: \n
Whether, adopted to some neighbouring star, \n
Thou roll'st above us, in thy wand'ring race, \n
Or, in procession fix'd and regular, \n
Mov'd with the Heavens' majestic pace: \n
Or, call'd to more superior bliss, \n
Thou tread'st, with seraphims, the vast abyss. \n
What ever happy region is thy place, \n
Cease thy celestial song a little space; \n
(Thou wilt have time enough for hymns divine, \n
Since Heav'n's eternal year is thine.) \n
Hear then a mortal Muse thy praise rehearse, \n
In no ignoble verse; \n
But such as thy own voice did practise here, \n
When thy first fruits of poesy were giv'n; \n
To make thyself a welcome inmate there: \n
While yet a young probationer, \n
And Candidate of Heav'n. \n
If by traduction came thy mind, \n
Our wonder is the less to find \n
A soul so charming from a stock so good; \n
Thy father was transfus'd into thy blood: \n
So wert thou born into the tuneful strain, \n
(An early, rich, and inexhausted vein.) \n
But if thy preexisting soul \n
Was form'd, at first, with myriads more, \n
It did through all the mighty poets roll, \n
Who Greek or Latin laurels wore, \n
And was that Sappho last, which once it was before. \n
If so, then cease thy flight, O Heav'n-born mind! \n
Thou hast no dross to purge from thy rich ore: \n
Nor can thy soul a fairer mansion find, \n
Than was the beauteous frame she left behind: \n
Return, to fill or mend the choir, of thy celestial kind. \n
May we presume to say, that at thy birth, \n
New joy was sprung in Heav'n as well as here on earth. \n
For sure the milder planets did combine \n
On thy auspicious horoscope to shine, \n
And ev'n the most malicious were in trine. \n
Thy brother-angels at thy birth \n
Strung each his lyre, and tun'd it high, \n
That all the people of the sky \n
Might know a poetess was born on earth; \n
And then if ever, mortal ears \n
Had heard the music of the spheres! \n
And if no clust'ring swarm of bees \n
On thy sweet mouth distill'd their golden dew, \n
'Twas that, such vulgar miracles, \n
Heav'n had not leisure to renew: \n
For all the blest fraternity of love \n
Solemniz'd there thy birth, and kept thy Holyday above. \n
O Gracious God! How far have we \n
Profan'd thy Heav'nly gift of poesy? \n
Made prostitute and profligate the Muse, \n
Debas'd to each obscene and impious use, \n
Whose harmony was first ordain'd above \n
For tongues of angels, and for hymns of love? \n
O wretched we! why were we hurried down \n
This lubrique and adult'rate age, \n
(Nay added fat pollutions of our own) \n
T'increase the steaming ordures of the stage? \n
What can we say t'excuse our Second Fall? \n
Let this thy vestal, Heav'n, atone for all! \n
Her Arethusian stream remains unsoil'd, \n
Unmix'd with foreign filth, and undefil'd, \n
Her wit was more than man, her innocence a child! \n
Art she had none, yet wanted none: \n
For Nature did that want supply, \n
So rich in treasures of her own, \n
She might our boasted stores defy: \n
Such noble vigour did her verse adorn, \n
That it seem'd borrow'd, where 'twas only born. \n
Her morals too were in her bosom bred \n
By great examples daily fed, \n
What in the best of Books, her Father's Life, she read. \n
And to be read her self she need not fear, \n
Each test, and ev'ry light, her Muse will bear, \n
Though Epictetus with his lamp were there. \n
Ev'n love (for love sometimes her Muse express'd) \n
Was but a lambent-flame which play'd about her breast: \n
Light as the vapours of a morning dream, \n
So cold herself, whilst she such warmth express'd, \n
'Twas Cupid bathing in Diana's stream. \n
Born to the spacious empire of the Nine, \n
One would have thought, she should have been content \n
To manage well that mighty government; \n
But what can young ambitious souls confine? \n
To the next realm she stretch'd her sway, \n
For painture near adjoining lay, \n
A plenteous province, and alluring prey. \n
A chamber of dependences was fram'd, \n
(As conquerors will never want pretence, \n
When arm'd, to justify th'offence) \n
And the whole fief, in right of poetry she claim'd. \n
The country open lay without defence: \n
For poets frequent inroads there had made, \n
And perfectly could represent \n
The shape, the face, with ev'ry lineament: \n
And all the large domains which the Dumb-sister sway'd, \n
All bow'd beneath her government, \n
Receiv'd in triumph wheresoe'er she went, \n
Her pencil drew, what e'er her soul design'd, \n
And oft the happy draught surpass'd the image in her mind. \n
The sylvan scenes of herds and flocks, \n
And fruitful plains and barren rocks, \n
Of shallow brooks that flow'd so clear, \n
The bottom did the top appear; \n
Of deeper too and ampler floods, \n
Which as in mirrors, show'd the woods; \n
Of lofty trees, with sacred shades, \n
And perspectives of pleasant glades, \n
Where nymphs of brightest form appear, \n
And shaggy satyrs standing near, \n
Which them at once admire and fear. \n
The ruins too of some majestic piece, \n
Boasting the pow'r of ancient Rome or Greece, \n
Whose statues, friezes, columns broken lie, \n
And tho' defac'd, the wonder of the eye, \n
What Nature, art, bold fiction e'er durst frame, \n
Her forming hand gave feature to the name. \n
So strange a concourse ne'er was seen before, \n
But when the peopl'd Ark the whole creation bore. \n
The scene then chang'd, with bold erected look \n
Our martial king the sight with reverence strook: \n
For not content t'express his outward part, \n
Her hand call'd out the image of his heart, \n
His warlike mind, his soul devoid of fear, \n
His high-designing thoughts, were figur'd there, \n
As when, by magic, ghosts are made appear. \n
Our phoenix queen was portray'd too so bright, \n
Beauty alone could beauty take so right: \n
Her dress, her shape, her matchless grace, \n
Were all observ'd, as well as heav'nly face. \n
With such a peerless majesty she stands, \n
As in that day she took the crown from sacred hands: \n
Before a train of heroines was seen, \n
In beauty foremost, as in rank, the queen! \n
Thus nothing to her genius was deny'd, \n
But like a ball of fire the further thrown, \n
Still with a greater blaze she shone, \n
And her bright soul broke out on ev'ry side. \n
What next she had design'd, Heaven only knows, \n
To such immod'rate growth her conquest rose, \n
That fate alone its progress could oppose. \n
Now all those charms, that blooming grace, \n
The well-proportion'd shape, and beauteous face, \n
Shall never more be seen by mortal eyes; \n
In earth the much lamented virgin lies! \n
Not wit, not piety could fate prevent; \n
Nor was the cruel destiny content \n
To finish all the murder at a blow, \n
To sweep at once her life, and beauty too; \n
But, like a harden'd felon, took a pride \n
To work more mischievously slow, \n
And plunder'd first, and then destroy'd. \n
O double sacrilege on things divine, \n
To rob the relique, and deface the shrine! \n
But thus Orinda died: \n
Heav'n, by the same disease, did both translate, \n
As equal were their souls, so equal was their fate. \n
Meantime her warlike brother on the seas \n
His waving streamers to the winds displays, \n
And vows for his return, with vain devotion, pays. \n
Ah, generous youth, that wish forbear, \n
The winds too soon will waft thee here! \n
Slack all thy sails, and fear to come, \n
Alas, thou know'st not, thou art wreck'd at home! \n
No more shalt thou behold thy sister's face, \n
Thou hast already had her last embrace. \n
But look aloft, and if thou ken'st from far, \n
Among the Pleiad's, a new-kindl'd star, \n
If any sparkles, than the rest, more bright, \n
'Tis she that shines in that propitious light. \n
When in mid-air, the golden trump shall sound, \n
To raise the nations under ground; \n
When in the valley of Jehosophat, \n
The Judging God shall close the book of fate; \n
And there the last Assizes keep, \n
For those who wake, and those who sleep; \n
When rattling bones together fly, \n
From the four corners of the sky, \n
When sinews o'er the skeletons are spread, \n
Those cloth'd with flesh, and life inspires the dead; \n
The sacred poets first shall hear the sound, \n
And foremost from the tomb shall bound: \n
For they are cover'd with the lightest ground, \n
And straight, with in-born vigour, on the wing, \n
Like mounting larks, to the new morning sing. \n
There thou, sweet saint, before the choir shall go, \n
As harbinger of Heav'n, the way to show, \n
The way which thou so well hast learn'd below. \n<|endoftext|>

memory \n
Soul of the Poet ! wheresoe'er, \n
Reclaimed from earth, thy genius plume \n
Her wings of immortality ; \n
Suspend thy harp in happier sphere, \n
And with thine influence illume \n
The gladness of our jubilee. \n
And fly like fiends from secret spell, \n
Discord and Strife, at Burn's name, \n
Exorcised by his memory ; \n
For he was chief of bards that swell \n
The heart with songs of social flame, \n
And high delicious revelry. \n
And Love's own strain to him was given, \n
To warble all its ecstacies \n
With Pythian words unsought, unwilled,— \n
Love, the surviving gift of Heaven \n
The choicest sweet of Paradise, \n
In life's else bitter cup distilled. \n
Who that has melted o'er his lay \n
To Mary's soul, in Heaven above , \n
But pictured sees, in fancy strong, \n
The landscape and the livelong day \n
That smiled upon their mutual love ? \n
Who that has felt forgets the song ? \n
Nor skilled one flame alone to fan: \n
His country's high-souled peasantry \n
What patriot-pride he taught !—how much \n
To weigh the inborn worth of man ! \n
And rustic life and poverty \n
Grow beautiful beneath his touch. \n
Him, in his clay-built cot, the Muse \n
Entranced, and showed him all the forms, \n
Of fairy-light and wizard gloom, \n
(That only gifted Poet views,) \n
The Genii of the floods and storms, \n
And martial shades from Glory's tomb. \n
On Bannock-field what thoughts arouse \n
The swain whom Burns's song inspires ! \n
Beat not his Caledonian veins, \n
As o'er the heroic turf he ploughs, \n
With all the spirit of his sires, \n
And all their scorn of death and chains ? \n
And see the Scottish exile, tanned \n
By many a far and foreign clime, \n
Bend o'er his home-born verse, and weep \n
In memory of his native land, \n
With love that scorns the lapse of time, \n
And ties that stretch beyond the deep. \n
Encamped by Indian rivers wild, \n
The soldier resting on his arms, \n
In Burns's carol sweet recalls \n
The scenes that blessed him when a child, \n
And glows and gladdens at the charms \n
Of Scotia's woods and waterfalls. \n
O deem not, 'midst this worldly strife, \n
An idle art the Poet brings: \n
Let high Philosophy control, \n
And sages calm the stream of life, \n
'T is he refines its fountain-springs, \n
The nobler passions of the soul. \n
It is the muse that consecrates \n
The native banner of the brave, \n
Unfurling, at the trumpet's breath, \n
Rose, thistle, harp ; 't is she elates \n
To sweep the field or ride the wave, \n
A sunburst in the storm of death. \n
And thou, young hero , when thy pall \n
Is crossed with mournful sword and plume, \n
When public grief begins to fade, \n
And only tears of kindred fall, \n
Who but the bard shall dress thy tomb, \n
And greet with fame thy gallant shade ? \n
Such was the soldier—Burns, forgive \n
That sorrows of mine own intrude \n
In strains to thy great memory due. \n
In verse like thine, oh ! Could he live, \n
The friend I mourned—the brave—the good \n
Edward that died at Waterloo !* \n
Farewell, high chief of Scottish song ! \n
That couldst alternately impart \n
Wisdom and rapture in thy page, \n
And brand each vice with satire strong, \n
Whose lines are mottoes of the heart? \n
Whose truths electrify the sage. \n
Farewell ! and ne'er may Envy dare \n
To wring one baleful poison drop \n
From the crushed laurels of thy bust ; \n
But while the lark sings sweet in air, \n
Still may the grateful pilgrim stop, \n
To bless the spot that holds thy dust. \n<|endoftext|>
memory \n
Shall the great soul of Newton quit this earth, \n
To mingle with his stars; and every muse, \n
Astonish'd into silence, shun the weight \n
Of honours due to his illustrious name? \n
But what can man?--Even now the sons of light, \n
In strains high-warbled to seraphic lyre, \n
Hail his arrival on the coast of bliss. \n
Yet am not I deterr'd, though high the theme, \n
And sung to harps of angels, for with you, \n
Ethereal flames! ambitious, I aspire \n
In Nature's general symphony to join. \n
And what new wonders can ye show your guest! \n
Who, while on this dim spot, where mortals toil \n
Clouded in dust, from motion's simple laws, \n
Could trace the secret hand of Providence, \n
Wide-working through this universal frame. \n
Have ye not listen'd while he bound the suns \n
And planets to their spheres! th' unequal task \n
Of humankind till then. Oft had they roll'd \n
O'er erring man the year, and oft disgrac'd \n
The pride of schools, before their course was known \n
Full in its causes and effects to him, \n
All-piercing sage! who sat not down and dream'd \n
Romantic schemes, defended by the din \n
Of specious words, and tyranny of names; \n
But, bidding his amazing mind attend, \n
And with heroic patience years on years \n
Deep-searching, saw at last the system dawn, \n
And shine, of all his race, on him alone. \n
What were his raptures then! how pure! how strong! \n
And what the triumphs of old Greece and Rome, \n
By his diminish'd, but the pride of boys \n
In some small fray victorious! when instead \n
Of shatter'd parcels of this earth usurp'd \n
By violence unmanly, and sore deeds \n
Of cruelty and blood, Nature herself \n
Stood all subdu'd by him, and open laid \n
Her every latent glory to his view. \n
All intellectual eye, our solar-round \n
First gazing through, he by the blended power \n
Of gravitation and projection saw \n
The whole in silent harmony revolve. \n
From unassisted vision hid, the moons \n
To cheer remoter planets numerous pour'd, \n
By him in all their mingled tracts were seen. \n
He also fix'd the wandering Queen of Night, \n
Whether she wanes into a scanty orb, \n
Or, waxing broad, with her pale shadowy light, \n
In a soft deluge overflows the sky. \n
Her every motion clear-discerning, he \n
Adjusted to the mutual main, and taught \n
Why now the mighty mass of water swells \n
Resistless, heaving on the broken rocks, \n
And the full river turning; till again \n
The tide revertive, unattracted, leaves \n
A yellow waste of idle sands behind. \n
Then breaking hence, he took his ardent flight \n
Through the blue infinite; and every star, \n
Which the clear concave of a winter's night \n
Pours on the eye, or astronomic tube, \n
Far-stretching, snatches from the dark abyss, \n
Or such as farther in successive skies \n
To fancy shine alone, at his approach \n
Blaz'd into suns, the living centre each \n
Of an harmonious system: all combin'd, \n
And rul'd unerring by that single power, \n
Which draws the stone projected to the ground. \n
O unprofuse magnificence divine! \n
O wisdom truly perfect! thus to call \n
From a few causes such a scheme of things, \n
Effects so various, beautiful, and great, \n
An universe complete! and O belov'd \n
Of Heaven! whose well-purg'd penetrative eye, \n
The mystic veil transpiercing, inly scann'd \n
The rising, moving, wide-establish'd frame. \n
He, first of men, with awful wing pursu'd \n
The comet through the long elliptic curve, \n
As round innumerous worlds he wound his way, \n
Till, to the forehead of our evening sky \n
Return'd, the blazing wonder glares anew, \n
And o'er the trembling nations shakes dismay. \n
The heavens are all his own, from the wild rule \n
Of whirling vortices and circling spheres \n
To their first great simplicity restor'd. \n
The schools astonish'd stood; but found it vain \n
To keep at odds with demonstration strong, \n
And, unawaken'd, dream beneath the blaze \n
Of truth. At once their pleasing visions fled, \n
With the gay shadows of the morning mix'd, \n
When Newton rose, our philosophic sun! \n
Th' aërial flow of sound was known to him, \n
From whence it first in wavy circles breaks, \n
Till the touch'd organ takes the message in. \n
Nor could the darting beam of speed immense \n
Escape his swift pursuit and measuring eye. \n
Ev'n Light itself, which every thing displays, \n
Shone undiscover'd, till his brighter mind \n
Untwisted all the shining robe of day; \n
And, from the whitening undistinguish'd blaze, \n
Collecting every ray into his kind, \n
To the charm'd eye educ'd the gorgeous train \n
Of parent colours. First the flaming red \n
Sprung vivid forth; the tawny orange next; \n
And next delicious yellow; by whose side \n
Fell the kind beams of all-refreshing green. \n
Then the pure blue, that swells autumnal skies \n
Ethereal played; and then, of sadder hue, \n
Emerg'd the deepen'd indigo, as when \n
The heavy-skirted evening droops with frost; \n
While the last gleamings of refracted light \n
Died in the fainting violet away. \n
These, when the clouds distil the rosy shower, \n
Shine out distinct adown the wat'ry bow; \n
While o'er our heads the dewy vision bends \n
Delightful, melting on the fields beneath. \n
Myriads of mingling dyes from these result, \n
And myriads still remain--infinite source \n
Of beauty, ever flushing, ever new. \n
Did ever poet image aught so fair, \n
Dreaming in whisp'ring groves by the hoarse brook? \n
Or prophet, to whose rapture heaven descends? \n
Ev'n now the setting sun and shifting clouds, \n
Seen, Greenwich, from thy lovely heights, declare \n
How just, how beauteous the refractive law. \n
The noiseless tide of time, all bearing down \n
To vast eternity's unbounded sea, \n
Where the green islands of the happy shine, \n
He stemm'd alone; and, to the source (involv'd \n
Deep in primeval gloom) ascending, rais'd \n
His lights at equal distances, to guide \n
Historian wilder'd on his darksome way. \n
But who can number up his labours? who \n
His high discoveries sing? When but a few \n
Of the deep-studying race can stretch their minds \n
To what he knew--in fancy's lighter thought \n
How shall the muse then grasp the mighty theme? \n
What wonder thence that his devotion swell'd \n
Responsive to his knowledge? For could he, \n
Whose piercing mental eye diffusive saw \n
The finish'd university of things \n
In all its order, magnitude, and parts, \n
Forbear incessant to adore that Power \n
Who fills, sustains, and actuates the whole? \n
Say, ye who best can tell, ye happy few, \n
Who saw him in the softest lights of life, \n
All unwithheld, indulging to his friends \n
The vast unborrow'd treasures of his mind, \n
oh, speak the wondrous man! how mild, how calr \n
How greatly humble, how divinely good, \n
How firm establish'd on eternal truth; \n
Fervent in doing well, with every nerve \n
Still pressing on, forgetful of the past, \n
And panting for perfection; far above \n
Those little cares and visionary joys \n
That so perplex the fond impassion'd heart \n
Of ever-cheated, ever-trusting man. \n
This, Conduitt, from thy rural hours we hope; \n
As through the pleasing shade where nature pours \n
Her every sweet in studious ease you walk, \n
The social passions smiling at thy heart \n
That glows with all the recollected sage. \n
And you, ye hopeless gloomy-minded tribe, \n
You who, unconscious of those nobler flights \n
That reach impatient at immortal life, \n
Against the prime endearing privilege \n
Of being dare contend,--say, can a soul \n
Of such extensive, deep, tremendous powers, \n
Enlarging still, be but a finer breath \n
Of spirits dancing through their tubes awhile, \n
And then for ever lost in vacant air? \n
But hark! methinks I hear a warning voice, \n
Solemn as when some awful change is come, \n
Sound through the world--" 'Tis done!--the measure's full; \n
And I resign my charge."--Ye mouldering stones \n
That build the towering pyramid, the proud \n
Triumphal arch, the monument effac'd \n
By ruthless ruin, and whate'er supports \n
The worship'd name of hoar antiquity-- \n
Down to the dust! What grandeur can ye boast \n
While Newton lifts his column to the skies, \n
Beyond the waste of time. Let no weak drop \n
Be shed for him. The virgin in her bloom \n
Cut off, the joyous youth, and darling child-- \n
These are the tombs that claim the tender tear \n
And elegiac song. But Newton calls \n
For other notes of gratulation high, \n
That now he wanders through those endless worlds \n
He here so well descried, and wondering talks, \n
And hymns their Author with his glad compeers. \n
O Britain's boast! whether with angels thou \n
Sittest in dread discourse, or fellow-blest, \n
Who joy to see the honour of their kind; \n
Or whether, mounted on cherubic wing, \n
Thy swift career is with the whirling orbs, \n
Comparing things with things, in rapture lost, \n
And grateful adoration for that light \n
So plenteous ray'd into thy mind below \n
From Light Himself; oh, look with pity down \n
On humankind, a frail erroneous race! \n
Exalt the spirit of a downward world! \n
O'er thy dejected country chief preside, \n
And be her Genius call'd! her studies raise, \n
Correct her manners, and inspire her youth; \n
For, though deprav'd and sunk, she brought thee forth, \n
And glories in thy name! she points thee out \n
To all her sons, and bids them eye thy star: \n
While, in expectance of the second life, \n
When time shall be no more, thy sacred dust \n
Sleeps with her kings, and dignifies the scene. \n<|endoftext|>

Oh Britain! dear Isle, when the annals of story \n

When the strains of each poet shall sing of their glory, \n

When the olive and palm in thy chaplet are blended, \n
When thy arts, and thy fame, and thy commerce increase, \n
When thy arms through the uttermost coasts are extended, \n
And thy war is triumphant, and happy thy peace; \n

Conveying thy mandates to every shore, \n

Remember the man who in sorrow and danger, \n
When thy glory was set, and thy spirit was low, \n
When thy hopes were o'erturned by the arms of the stranger, \n
And thy banners displayed in the halls of the foe, \n
Stood forth in the tempest of doubt and disaster, \n
Unaided, and single, the danger to brave. \n
Asserted thy claims, and the rights of his master, \n
Preserved thee to conquer, and saved thee to save. \n<|endoftext|>

memory \n
(Nicola Sacco -- Bartolomeo Vanzetti) \n
Executed August 23, 1927 \n
I \n
As men have loved their lovers in times past \n
And sung their wit, their virtue and their grace, \n
So have we loved sweet Justice to the last, \n
That now lies here in an unseemly place. \n
The child will quit the cradle and grow wise \n
And stare on beauty till his senses drown; \n
Yet shall be seen no more by mortal eyes \n
Such beauty as here walked and here went down. \n
Like birds that hear the winter crying plain \n
Her courtiers leave to seek the clement south; \n
Many have praised her, we alone remain \n
To break a fist against the lying mouth \n
Of any man who says this was not so: \n
Though she be dead now, as indeed we know. \n
II \n
Where can the heart be hidden in the ground \n
And be at peace, and be at peace forever, \n
Under the world, untroubled by the sound \n
Of mortal tears, that cease from pouring never? \n
Well for the heart, by stern compassion harried, \n
If death be deeper than the churchmen say, -- \n
Gone from this world indeed what's graveward carried, \n
And laid to rest indeed what's laid away. \n
Anguish enough while yet the indignant breather \n
Have blood to spurt upon the oppressor's hand; \n
Who would eternal be, and hang in ether \n
A stuffless ghost above his struggling land, \n
Retching in vain to render up the groan \n
That is not there, being aching dust's alone? \n<|endoftext|>
memory \n
After the funeral, mule praises, brays, \n
Windshake of sailshaped ears, muffle-toed tap \n
Tap happily of one peg in the thick \n
Grave's foot, blinds down the lids, the teeth in black, \n
The spittled eyes, the salt ponds in the sleeves, \n
Morning smack of the spade that wakes up sleep, \n
Shakes a desolate boy who slits his throat \n
In the dark of the coffin and sheds dry leaves, \n
That breaks one bone to light with a judgment clout' \n
After the feast of tear-stuffed time and thistles \n
In a room with a stuffed fox and a stale fern, \n
I stand, for this memorial's sake, alone \n
In the snivelling hours with dead, humped Ann \n
Whose hodded, fountain heart once fell in puddles \n
Round the parched worlds of Wales and drowned each sun \n
(Though this for her is a monstrous image blindly \n
Magnified out of praise; her death was a still drop; \n
She would not have me sinking in the holy \n
Flood of her heart's fame; she would lie dumb and deep \n
And need no druid of her broken body). \n
But I, Ann's bard on a raised hearth, call all \n
The seas to service that her wood-tongud virtue \n
Babble like a bellbuoy over the hymning heads, \n
Bow down the walls of the ferned and foxy woods \n
That her love sing and swing through a brown chapel, \n
Blees her bent spirit with four, crossing birds. \n
Her flesh was meek as milk, but this skyward statue \n
With the wild breast and blessed and giant skull \n
Is carved from her in a room with a wet window \n
In a fiercely mourning house in a crooked year. \n
I know her scrubbed and sour humble hands \n
Lie with religion in their cramp, her threadbare \n
Whisper in a damp word, her wits drilled hollow, \n
Her fist of a face died clenched on a round pain; \n
And sculptured Ann is seventy years of stone. \n
These cloud-sopped, marble hands, this monumental \n
Argument of the hewn voice, gesture and psalm \n
Storm me forever over her grave until \n
The stuffed lung of the fox twitch and cry Love \n
And the strutting fern lay seeds on the black sill. \n<|endoftext|>
memory \n
"Fate snatch'd him early to the pitying sky." \n
- POPE. \n
IF WORTH, too early to the grave consign'd, \n
Can claim the pitying tear, or touch the mind ? \n
If manly sentiments unstain'd by art, \n
Could waken FRIENDSHIP, or delight the heart ? \n
Ill-fated youth ! to THEE the MUSE shall pay \n
The last sad tribute of a mournful lay; \n
On thy lone grave shall MAY'S soft dews be shed, \n
And fairest flowrets blossom o'er thy head; \n
The drooping lily, and the snow-drop pale, \n
Mingling their fragrant leaves, shall there recline, \n
While CHERUBS hov'ring on th' ethereal gale, \n
Shall chaunt a requiem o'er the hallow'd shrine. \n
And if Reflection's piercing eye should scan \n
The trivial frailties of imperfect MAN; \n
If in thy generous heart those passions dwelt, \n
Which all should own, and all that live have felt; \n
Yet was thy polish'd mind so pure, so brave, \n
The young admir'd thee, and the old forgave. \n
And when stern FATE, with ruthless rancour, press'd \n
Thy withering graces to her flinty breast; \n
Bright JUSTICE darted from her bless'd abode, \n
And bore thy VIRTUES to the throne of GOD; \n
While cold OBLIVION stealing o'er thy mind, \n
Each youthful folly to the grave consign'd. \n
O, if thy purer spirit deigns to know \n
Each thought that passes in this vale of woe, \n
Accept the incense of a tender tear, \n
By PITY wafted on a sigh sincere. \n
And if the weeping MUSE a wreath could give \n
To grace thy tomb, and bid thy VIRTUES live; \n
THEN Wealth should blush the gilded mask to wear, \n
And Avarice shrink the victim of Despair. \n
While GENIUS bending o'er thy sable bier, \n
Should mourn her darling SON with many a tear, \n
While in her pensive form the world should view \n
The ONLY PARENT that thy SORROWS knew. \n<|endoftext|>

Iftikhar Hussain Rizvi is one of those Indian English poets \n
Of the seventies \n
Who seek to adhere to and perfect \n
The romantic traits rather than taking \n
Any other contemporary realms. \n
The kernel of romanticism he has definitely got \n
From the English and European masters and their theories of poetry which they used in \n
While practising their verse \n
And Rizvi can be o exception to it \n
As because he has taught and read English as a teacher. \n
Somewhere he seems to be leaning to Urdu lyrics and lyricism \n
Seen in the composition of shayaris \n
And he a shayar of these, a lyric writer, \n
Writing the lyrics of love, soulfully, heartfully. \n
To read Rizvi is come to feel that roses too appear \n
To be wounded and bleeding \n
If the heart is sad and broken and the ache of the heart, \n
None but Keats felt it. \n
Laila's pains are therein; those of Majnu's, burning for \n
Each other, pining for, \n
But the heartless, medievalist people cannot let them meet. \n
A lover's heart is the space of his writing and he inducts in dream, Colour, fancy and imagination to paint his ideas and images. \n
He is a lover; a dreamer who keeps loving and dreaming about \n
Man and the world, \n
Falling Petals, Unfading Blooms, Thirsty Pebbles, \n
Wandering Fragrance, Wounded Roses Sing. \n
Snowflakes of Dreams, Gathering Broken Glasses, Clouds in Cages, Fettered Birds, Dripping Wounds, Love Never Dies, \n
Haiku & Other Poems, The Valley Still Blossoms and others \n

'Silly girl, listen!' \n
But she doesn't listen \n
While the village roofs glisten, \n
Bright in the sun. \n
'Silly girl, what do you do there, \n
As if there were someone to view there, \n
A face to gaze on and greet there, \n
A live form warmly to meet there, \n
When there is no one, none, do you hear?' \n
But she doesn't hear. \n
Like a dead stone \n
She stands there alone, \n
Staring ahead of her, peering around \n
For something that has to be found \n
Till, suddenly spying it, \n
She touches it, clutches it, \n
Laughing and crying. \n
Is it you, my Johnny, my true love, my dear? \n
I knew you would never forget me, \n
Even in death! Come with me, let me \n
Show you the way now! \n
Hold your breath, though, \n
And tiptoe lest stepmother hear! \n
What can she hear? They have made him \n
A grave, two years ago laid him \n
Away with the dead. \n
Save me, Mother of God! I'm afraid. \n
But why? Why should I flee you now? \n
What do I dread? \n
Not Johnny! My Johnny won't hurt me. \n
It is my Johnny! I see you now, \n
Your eyes, your white shirt. \n
But it's pale as linen you are, \n
Cold as winter you are! \n
Let my lips take the cold from you, \n
Kiss the chill o f the mould from you. \n
Dearest love, let me die with you, \n
In the deep earth lie with you, \n
For this world is dark and dreary, \n
I am lonely and weary! \n
Alone among the unkind ones \n
Who mock at my vision, \n
My tears their derision, \n
Seeing nothing, the blind ones! \n
Dear God! A cock is crowing, \n
Whitely glimmers the dawn. \n
Johnny! Where are you going? \n
Don't leave me! I am forlorn! \n
So, caressing, talking aloud to her \n
Lover, she stumbles and falls, \n
And her cry of anguish calls \n
A pitying crowd to her. \n
'Cross yourselves! It is, surely, \n
Her Johnny come back from the grave: \n
While he lived, he loved her entirely. \n
May God his soul now save!' \n
Hearing what they are saying, \n
I, too, start praying. \n
'The girl is out of her senses!' \n
Shouts a man with a learned air, \n
'My eye and my lenses \n
Know there's nothing there. \n
Ghosts are a myth \n
Of ale-wife and blacksmith. \n
Clodhoppers! This is treason \n
Against King Reason!' \n
'Yet the girl loves,' I reply diffidently, \n
'And the people believe reverently: \n
Faith and love are more discerning \n
Than lenses or learning. \n
You know the dead truths, not the living, \n
The world of things, not the world of loving. \n

The romantic, \n
How to get myself popular, \n
You say it, \n
I want to be a romantic, \n
How to be? \n
Should I dress myself, \n
Up-to-date, modern, frank and daring in my outlook \n
Or should I bring the used in boots, shirts and pants \n
Of my or your father, grandfather and great grandfather \n
As for to be a romantic? \n
An impressionist, a transcendentalist, \n
A smoker and writer \n
Experimenting with the cheroot and the cigarette, \n
The beedi and the hookah \n
To be a romantic, \n
A romantic writer. \n
Sometimes as a hippie, sometimes as a gipsy, \n
Isn't it, \n
Isn't the sweet dreams of yours, \n
But mark it \n
That such a living may be dangerous too \n
As this may mislead you too? \n
The drug-trafficker and the woman-trafficker, \n
The mafia don and the smuggler everywhere, \n
Just for to be a writer, \n
A romantic and mystic, \n
A transcendentalist and impressionist, \n
You destroy not yourself. \n<|endoftext|>

You come in and sit down while looking around \n
I tell you don’t be afraid just relax for this is your night \n
I’ve prepared all day for this one perfect night \n
Topped with music, food, wine and a flickering candle light \n
We eat, drink, laugh, and talk just for starters \n
I began to gaze into your stars stolen from the sky eyes \n
As you lay in my arms looking up at me in utter surprised \n
I stand you up and slowly walk you into my room \n
I began to undress you piece by piece \n
While the aroma of the room puts you at ease \n
I tell you to lie down flat on your stomach \n
Then your fantasy's and fascinations’ begin to run wild \n
Now I have a strong appetite for your love and I want it now \n
Yet the moment is not now so I tell myself to slow down \n
So I begin giving you a full body massage \n
Not just any massage I mean really caressing your every curve \n
Tonight I’m your servant and I’m ready to serve \n
I smell and inhale a deep breath of air from your hair \n
I slowly and passionfully kiss the back of your neck \n
As I go down your body, kissing alot and not missing a spot \n
You moan in acceptance and squirm in the sheets \n
I roll you over in a burst of excitement and delightment \n
I admire your body in its full entirety \n
For a second I pause, A body so beautiful even with flaws \n
I complete the front of you the same way I did your back \n
Paying close attention to areas that I need not mention \n
Your body begins to shiver and I know what that means \n
So I continue to go at it until you and your body screams \n
I can feel you blood pulsating as I slowly raise up \n
You whisper in my ear that you are ready to feel me \n
I waste no time because I'm ready to feel you to \n
A lovely feel of wetness and warmth as I slide into you \n
As we engage in this overwhelming love making \n
I hope you know my body is yours for the taking \n
our minds escapes this physical world to a place all of our own \n
We try all the position our little nympho minds can ponder \n
We are dripping wet so full of sweat \n
You have climaxed many of times \n
Then you tell me your ready for mines \n
Not wanted this to stop but I feel I have no choice \n
I feel you shiver and I join in the fun and now were done \n
Slowly this saga has come to a end \n
I hold you tight as we drift off to sleep \n
I tell you I love you and kiss you good night... \n

cinderella \n
Cinderella and her dog \n
sat at home on the old log. \n
Sisters had gone to the dance \n
homely ones did have no chance. \n
Said the dog 'my Cinderella, \n
may I be this evening's fella, \n
we could wash and dress with care \n
and could make a handsome pair.' \n
She had raised her bushy brow, \n
asked the clever dog just how \n
they would get into the castle \n
while avoiding a big hassle. \n
'You are nothing but a mutt, \n
always scratching your big butt, \n
full of craziness and fleas \n
barely reach up to my knees.' \n
Dog had motives quite ulterior, \n
said 'I'm not at all inferior, \n
every dog, on the inside \n
hides a man beneath his hide. \n
All it needs is one French Kiss, \n
which in turn produces bliss, \n
makes me into your own prince \n
(turns away and quickly grins) , \n
Bravely Cinderella acts, \n
knowing only half the facts. \n
Kisses him for one whole hour \n
to release that magic power. \n
But no miracle breaks free, \n
dog lifts leg now, just to pee, \n
doesn't seem the least surprised, \n
she has still not realised \n
that the dog has pulled her leg. \n
So she now begins to beg: \n
'I will kiss you one more time, \n
please come out, man in your prime. \n
Let me tell you that your breath \n
is far worse than Father Death.' \n
So, they kiss again and linger \n
as the Emperor's own singer \n
happens to be wand'ring by, \n
carrying a rhubarb pie. \n
'Sir', pleads pretty Cinderella, \n
you, the singer Pico Bella, \n
can you give us some advice? ' \n
Pico says 'You have nice eyes, \n
but a mutt will stay a mutt, \n
into man a mutt cannot \n
metamorph through simple kissing, \n
since he has genetics missing.' \n
Well, she turned now to the critter, \n
hot, enraged and really bitter, \n
'How could YOU, a lowly dog \n
who sleeps in a hollow log \n
trick me into kissing French \n
with your halitosis stench? ' \n
'Look', he answered, 'truly sorry, \n
first, I had to have a story, \n
all my life I've not been kissed, \n
but I am a journalist. \n
Hired by the King's own wife, \n
never gotten into strife. \n
Learned that one can grab a chance \n
if the lady likes to dance.' \n<|endoftext|>

If I was Cinderella would you love me? \n
Would you pick me up in a gold carriage and dance with me till midnight? \n
When I run, will you never give up, and chase after me just to give me a passionate kiss? \n
Will you marry me the next day, saying that you found your one and true love? \n
Will you make me feel special, and shower me with love and support that any man should give to his women? \n
But, that won't happen. \n
Because I'm not Cinderella. I'm not Cinderella, because I won't have anyone that will love me enough to drive me in a golden carriage, or chase after me when I get to scared to commit to anyone. I won't have anyone that will marry me the next day, because they know that I'm their one and true love. I won't have anyone who will dance with me till midnight, because I'm just that special. \n
I wont have anyone to give me that passionate kiss. \n
To give me, that passionate kiss. \n<|endoftext|>

cinderella \n
The vainest girls in forty states \n
Were Gwendolyn and Gladys Gates; \n
They warbled slightly off the air, \n
Romantic German songs, \n
And each of them upon her hair \n
Employed the curling tongs, \n
And each with ardor most intense \n
Her buxom figure laced, \n
Until her wilful want of sense \n
Procured a woeful waist: \n
For bound to marry titled mates \n
Were Gwendolyn and Gladys Gates. \n
Yet, truth to tell, the swains were few \n
Of Gwendolyn (and Gladys, too). \n
So morning, afternoon, and night \n
Upon their sister they \n
Were wont to vent their selfish spite, \n
And in the rudest way: \n
For though her name was Leonore, \n
That's neither there nor here, \n
They called her Cinderella, for \n
The kitchen was her sphere, \n
Save when the hair she had to do \n
Of Gwendolyn (and Gladys, too). \n
Each night to dances and to fetes \n
Went Gwendolyn and Gladys Gates, \n
And Cinderella watched them go \n
In silks and satins clad: \n
A prince invited them, and so \n
They put on all they had! \n
But one fine night, as all alone \n
She watched the flames leap higher, \n
A small and stooping fairy crone \n
Stept nimbly from the fire. \n
Said she: 'The pride upon me grates \n
Of Gwendolyn and Gladys Gates.' \n
'I'll now,' she added, with a frown, \n
'Call Gwendolyn and Gladys down!' \n
And, ere your fingers you could snap, \n
There stood before the door \n
No paltry hired horse and trap, \n
Oh, no! - a coach and four! \n
And Cinderella, fitted out \n
Regardless of expense, \n
Made both her sisters look about \n
Like thirty-seven cents! \n
The prince, with one look at her gown, \n
Turned Gwendolyn and Gladys down! \n
Wall-flowers, when thus compared with her, \n
Both Gwendolyn and Gladys were. \n
The prince but gave them glances hard, \n
No gracious word he said; \n
He scratched their names from off his card, \n
And wrote hers down instead: \n
And where he would bestow his hand \n
He showed them in a trice \n
By handing her the kisses, and \n
To each of them an ice! \n
In sudden need of fire and fur \n
Both Gwendolyn and Gladys were. \n
At ten o'clock, in discontent, \n
Both Gwendolyn and Gladys went. \n
Their sister stayed till after two, \n
And, with a joy sincere, \n
The prince obtained her crystal shoe \n
By way of souvenir. \n
'Upon the bridal path,' he cried, \n
'We'll reign together! Since \n
I love you, you must be my bride!' \n
(He was no slouch, that prince!) \n
And into sudden languishment \n
Both Gwendolyn and Gladys went. \n
The Moral: All the girls on earth \n
Exaggerate their proper worth. \n
They think the very shoes they wear \n
Are worth the average millionaire; \n
Whereas few pairs in any town \n
Can be half-sold for half a crown! \n<|endoftext|>
cinderella \n
Pierced the Rays of mighty sun- \n
To wake her up from slumber. \n
With head weighing like a ton, \n
She awaited for the thunder. \n
Shouts came, heavy steps in follow \n
Cleared her face, as slept near hearth. \n
Prepared she for yet another blow, \n
Calmness and patience she taught \n
And everyone called her Cinderella. \n<|endoftext|>

Cinderella in the street \n
In a ragged gown, \n
Sloven slippers on her feet, \n
Shames our tidy town; \n
Harsh her locks of ashen grey, \n
Vapour vague her stare, \n
By the curb this bitter day \n
Selling papers there. \n
Cinderella once was sweet, \n
Fine and lily fair, \n
Silver slippers on her feet, \n
Ribands in her hair; \n
Solid men besought her hand, \n
Tart was she as quince, \n
Living in a fairy land, \n
Waiting for a Prince. \n
Days went by and years went by, \n
Wistful wan was she; \n
Heedless of a mother's sigh, \n
Of a lover's plea; \n
On her lips a carol gay, \n
In her heart a dream - \n
Soon the Prince would come her way, \n
Gallant and agleam. \n
Then at last she learned the truth, \n
How her hope was vain; \n
Gone her beauty, gone her youth, \n
Leaving want and pain. \n
See! she's waiting all alone; \n
Hark! you hear her cry \n
Papers by the cold curb-stone, \n
Begging you to buy. \n
Winter winds are waxing chill, \n
Clouds rack overhead; \n
Cinderella will be ill, \n
Bye and bye be dead. \n
Yet she kept her vision clear, \n
To Romance was true, \n
Holding him forever dear \n
Whom she never knew. \n
Cinderellas of to-day \n
Take no chance of loss; \n
When a good guy comes your way, \n
Nail him to the cross. \n
Let some ordinary cuss \n
Your coy heart convince; \n
Never miss the nuptial bus \n
Waiting for a Prince. \n<|endoftext|>

The lovable prince's charm she thought \n
The well ridden poems in human mind \n
Cinderella can read the minds prettily \n
Just like human computers in action \n
The stars, moons of different types \n
Different worlds, different live systems \n
Poor cinderella became blessed one \n
She got a place near the planets \n
For ever she looks to the earth she came \n
She shined and glittered like jewels \n
Where there is no prince, or paupers \n
The world of contentment only there \n
Where material gain is not a concern \n

The nobility of a great human being \n

Above oceans, mountains, and hillocks \n
To proclaim the noble feelings of love \n

My biggest fear since I was small has \n
ever been fear of boring nothingness \n
I commiserated with the animals for \n
their confinement to the here and now \n
and their enslavement to nature’s cycles \n
desperately seeking my own escape \n
through mind- power and ethereal \n
thoughts, but today I realize BEING is \n
JOY –only I am bereft of that privilege \n
of joyful being through my allergy… \n
I’m so glad to know the goodness of \n
the universe, but my question is \n
why was I born without the ability \n
to enjoy being ‘per se’, confined \n
to discomfort and pain – why was \n
I left out of everything? And will \n
this Cinderella ever get to go \n

But something happened to make the love vanish. \n
The dance ended as my Cinderella left me, slipping through my hands like the sands of time. \n
Now I'm hiding all my pain as I wonder if she's doing the same. Everyone asks if I'm fine, and that I'll move on someday, and I know this is true, but for now, I want my Cinderella back. \n
It hurts to think about it, no matter what I do, the dreams of the past haunt me.The laughs, smiles, hugs, dates, and kisses. They all won't leave me alone, as I keep wanting her back, nights of restless sleep for a few weeks. \n
I act like I'm fie, but in reality, I just want her to give me one more chance, perhaps a dance. We would dance slowly, just like before, and I would smile, because I would have my Cinderella back. \n<|endoftext|>

looking back in the mirror through which he gazes, \n
moon-eyed and at odds with himself, he presses \n
his palms, but the nightmare doesn’t stop. \n
The sky turns and nothing this moment matters. \n
Not even the cold thorns of the blind wind \n
blowing hellward, not even the poisoned rainbow \n
that lights his prayers can give meaning to doubt. \n
The sullen belladonna that pricks his mind \n

paper thin hit with poison darts. \n
The darkness grows and closes in, \n

Fallen hopes and fallen dreams, \n

Not a single soul is spared the pain, \n

Periwinkle blues, vibrant violets blend together creating an atmosphere \n
only beholding to the most beautiful creatures ever seen on the earths \n
ball-room of forever living. A defiance of immortality, living with the masters \n

Veils of black dust, streamers of grey silk torment while flowing over the \n
dark, still waters. Charcoal eyes seen beneath the quite mirrors of the \n
ocean sink deep. Climb in if you dare, enter the world of desperate \n
measures and despair. \n
Wait! ! ! Suddenly, an enormous hand appears through the sky and sends \n
shades of yellows with silver glints shining through. Ahhh the sound of \n
Music began to play, while the angles appear, they dance and dance through \n
the warm soothing air. \n
The ocean begins to ripple and the musical notes fall quietly through the \n
mirrored water taking their places beneath the still waters. Angels hover \n
over the window-like bed and the tears of glory fall through that oceanic \n
bed. No more heartbreak or fear. The master of miracles is here. \n
The invitation to visit the dark and dismal places of the deep, shall not be \n
accepted after-all. For this creature is covered by the hand of God and \n
Shall live in the land of peace and love, and forever be blessed by the master \n
Of good who rules and shines from above. \n

despair \n
Sometimes on a high tide \n
certain rules might not abide \n
returned from land again to ocean \n
one does not see any plausible reason \n
In the very first observation \n
arguably one sees no pattern \n
with the moving of time \n
somewhere in mind there strikes a rhyme \n
a flash of light \n
a glow of hope \n
to lay things straight \n
with a constant hope \n
the pattern is figured \n
the purpose served \n
still looms the uncertainty \n
observed pattern fails at infinity \n
Despair seeps in, one looses the power of will \n
Sinking in the past, making time to go standstill \n
imagining life to be some unbroken seal \n
however strong, time shall always heal \n<|endoftext|>
despair \n
AS evening shaped I found me on a moor \n
Which sight could scarce sustain: \n
The black lean land, of featureless contour, \n
Was like a tract in pain. \n
"This scene, like my own life," I said, "is one \n
Where many glooms abide; \n
Toned by its fortune to a deadly dun-- \n
Lightless on every side. \n
I glanced aloft and halted, pleasure-caught \n
To see the contrast there: \n
The ray-lit clouds gleamed glory; and I thought, \n
"There's solace everywhere!" \n
Then bitter self-reproaches as I stood \n
I dealt me silently \n
As one perverse--misrepresenting Good \n
In graceless mutiny. \n
Against the horizon's dim-descernèd wheel \n
A form rose, strange of mould: \n
That he was hideous, hopeless, I could feel \n
Rather than could behold. \n
"'Tis a dead spot, where even the light lies spent \n
To darkness!" croaked the Thing. \n
"Not if you look aloft!" said I, intent \n
On my new reasoning. \n
"Yea--but await awhile!" he cried. "Ho-ho!-- \n
Look now aloft and see!" \n
I looked. There, too, sat night: Heaven's radiant show \n
Had gone. Then chuckled he. \n<|endoftext|>
despair \n
Move away - from me, the form \n
Is parabolic in isolation, I’ll vet \n
The consequence and despair, despair \n
Will serve my hunger – \n
- Later - \n
And I’ll wait, wait for something, \n
Something greater - \n
Wait and I’ll wait \n
And I will have no pride - \n
The clouds will cast their twisted shadows \n
Over silver stallions that we ride. \n
The move away from - the publicans, the executors; \n
The prophets of destruction - shall we \n
Raise our crystal glasses, shall we \n
Utter bitter curses - curses \n
On the pain. \n
I’ll wipe away the tears - I’ll brush aside her hair; \n
It rains in these – this paradise - \n
A torrent of despair. \n<|endoftext|>

Sharon tells me she's thrilled \n
when she sees her skins peeled \n
From the scrapes of Tommy's fist \n
bruised from docking with her lip \n
But she says there always kindred \n
Infiltrated through her affection \n
When she gets him cornered down, \n
Like a housefly on her heel \n
Counter clockwise in his groin \n
Which thrills his pupils to counter twitch \n
On the chessboard colour floor \n
Where he moans with satisfaction \n
to be her incandescent whor- \n
And Even tells me that its heaven \n
When it's a quarter pass eleven \n
And little Sara's got him toped, \n
From an altitude that makes him drop \n
With her firm technicians grip \n
That has him writhing into fits \n
Raptures abound this tender bull \n
Bandaging him with a tumble fall \n
And stencils blue onto his neck \n
It's the comforts of her molesting \n
His inhibited recluse affections \n
The best attention always granted \n
when empathies contracted herpes \n
Malice quills the confines \n
of the insipidness of yuppies \n
Directing our destruction \n
In Mutually Assured Romantic Violence \n
So Bon appetite \n
We're coinsures of despair \n
Eloping debacles whenever we dare \n
To pour gasoline on our match lit embraces \n
Hiding in desserts to prowl long spaces \n
Dancing synchronous in a voodoo oasis \n
Never leaving the affliction of what we call each other \n
Because we are reflections of the same broken mirror \n
Entwined in web of malevolent luminescence \n
From which we cannot so soon depart \n
It was too soon to dance, \n
now it's too late to leave \n
Because Charon drives our four heeled steed \n
Towards our suicide ménage a trios \n
Me and her with, a friendly loaded gun \n
To fill the time with our immortal fun \n
We're an attractive duet, in Western stand off \n
Combating the silence, as two warheads in deadlock \n
So we celebrate the decent \n
in this tableaux baroque chaos \n
Trapped in the Kennel where the beggars languish \n
The starving enchantment of long distant anguish \n
Drinking the cognac as the connoisseur of despair \n
So we'll tie my arms in copper knots, \n
that scratch the veins with clever dots \n
Please make me crawl until I'm numb, \n
Stick the rattle in my palm \n
Than tie the chain around my neck \n
Make me bleed until I'm strong \n
Enthralled to burns of your lighter pen \n
Without your spit Ill fly long gone \n
Into the bayou of the rusted steam \n
To dream of teeth in my Capillaries \n
By the laurel tree that cries to leave \n
One night stands of archetype tragedies \n
Bliss is the sunshine at the end of a war \n
When we learn to walk the trenches of insuperable hell \n
And realise it's us who we will always drag down \n
Because we've opened these doors which will never close \n
Were refugees from some disease \n
Mad, Corrupt, and spoiled sl-+$ \n
Incarcerated to each other's needs \n
And always insisting on sipping that substance \n
Which invalidates reason of proportioned justice \n
Because we think were suitably happy \n
when the bed sheets pillar with a companions body \n
But there is only one black flower who satisfies my hobby \n
Drinking the wine \n
as Connoisseurs of Despair \n<|endoftext|>

How could I thwart off the situation? \n
It still needed some solace or evaluation \n
I was not expecting to do a wonder \n
But still I had many questions to ponder \n
I had lot more to do the good to the friendship \n
It was to remain in tact as companionship \n

It was inwardly pinching and killing \n

What is the world coming to? \n
Though carrying weapons is taboo \n
Children are happy totting the gun, \n
Whether to settle scores or just for fun. \n
When did innocence get lost and things changed? \n
It some how seems shocking and strange. \n
Too much T V, films is the reason \n
Reason elders for this violence and aggression. \n
Isn’t there lack of communication? \n
This has had deeper ramifications. \n
The young yearn for someone to share \n
Their confusion, but no one has time to spare. \n
If you are not there when your child needs you, \n
You will be the last to know what he brews \n
When he turns to his peers \n
To share his angst and fears. \n
A child is born out of a moment of ecstasy, \n
It is sad then you become too busy \n
To teach your child right from wrong, \n
And make him morally strong \n
Did you consider the likelihood \n
Of sacrifices you’ll have to make for parenthood? \n
And teach him to stand his ground \n
And not be bullied by any hound. \n
It is time to figure out \n
How to bring a turnabout. \n
In order to sort out this mess \n
Everyone has to try to impress \n
That none is above the law. \n
We have to overcome our flaws, \n
So our kids do not go astray. \n
Good sense prevails, I hope and pray. \n
Its already late \n
Don’t leave their future to chance and fate. \n<|endoftext|>

DESPAIR IN OLD AGE \n
Despair in old age \n
Dead friends \n
Friends sick and dying \n
The choice between the treatment \n
That draws the suffering out \n
And the sooner and more painful death \n
The boredom \n
The sense of one’s own uselessness \n
The futile striving to not be a hindrance to others \n
The vain effort not to look like a shipwreck \n
The sick smell of oneself \n
The loss of power in so many ways \n
The small naps in public places \n
The sense of one’s own uselessness \n
The understanding one has done what one could \n
And not done enough \n
And not done the best \n
The regret \n
The hatred of having others doing simple things for you \n
You can no longer do for yourself \n
The weakness \n
The aching \n
The pain \n
The boredom \n
The slowness of mind \n
The loss of interest \n
The feeling of oneself as a burden a disappointment \n
To others \n
The despair \n
The hopelessness \n
The wishing were all over \n
And the understanding that to finish it \n
Is to be a coward and leave a horrible legacy \n
The having too much time and remembering when one never had enough \n
The feeling of one’s own uselessness \n
The letting loved ones down \n
The loneliness \n
The boredom \n
The sadness \n
The hatred and contempt for oneself \n
And what one has against one’s every wish, become. \n
The long drawn-out never ending hopelessness of it all. \n<|endoftext|>

despair \n
The memory of you emerges from the night around me. \n
The river mingles its stubborn lament with the sea. \n
Deserted like the wharves at dawn. \n
It is the hour of departure, oh deserted one! \n
Cold flower heads are raining over my heart. \n
Oh pit of debris, fierce cave of the shipwrecked. \n
In you the wars and the flights accumulated. \n
From you the wings of the song birds rose. \n
You swallowed everything, like distance. \n
Like the sea, like time. In you everything sank! \n
It was the happy hour of assault and the kiss. \n
The hour of the spell that blazed like a lighthouse. \n
Pilot's dread, fury of blind driver, \n
turbulent drunkenness of love, in you everything sank! \n
In the childhood of mist my soul, winged and wounded. \n
Lost discoverer, in you everything sank! \n
You girdled sorrow, you clung to desire, \n
sadness stunned you, in you everything sank! \n
I made the wall of shadow draw back, \n
beyond desire and act, I walked on. \n
Oh flesh, my own flesh, woman whom I loved and lost, \n
I summon you in the moist hour, I raise my song to you. \n
Like a jar you housed infinite tenderness. \n
and the infinite oblivion shattered you like a jar. \n
There was the black solitude of the islands, \n
and there, woman of love, your arms took me in. \n
There was thirst and hunger, and you were the fruit. \n
There were grief and ruins, and you were the miracle. \n
Ah woman, I do not know how you could contain me \n
in the earth of your soul, in the cross of your arms! \n
How terrible and brief my desire was to you! \n
How difficult and drunken, how tensed and avid. \n
Cemetery of kisses, there is still fire in your tombs, \n
still the fruited boughs burn, pecked at by birds. \n
Oh the bitten mouth, oh the kissed limbs, \n
oh the hungering teeth, oh the entwined bodies. \n
Oh the mad coupling of hope and force \n
in which we merged and despaired. \n
And the tenderness, light as water and as flour. \n
And the word scarcely begun on the lips. \n
This was my destiny and in it was my voyage of my longing, \n
and in it my longing fell, in you everything sank! \n
Oh pit of debris, everything fell into you, \n
what sorrow did you not express, in what sorrow are you not drowned! \n
From billow to billow you still called and sang. \n
Standing like a sailor in the prow of a vessel. \n
You still flowered in songs, you still brike the currents. \n
Oh pit of debris, open and bitter well. \n
Pale blind diver, luckless slinger, \n
lost discoverer, in you everything sank! \n
It is the hour of departure, the hard cold hour \n
which the night fastens to all the timetables. \n
The rustling belt of the sea girdles the shore. \n
Cold stars heave up, black birds migrate. \n
Deserted like the wharves at dawn. \n
Only tremulous shadow twists in my hands. \n
Oh farther than everything. Oh farther than everything. \n
It is the hour of departure. Oh abandoned one! \n<|endoftext|>

together \n
For many, many days together \n
The wind blew steady from the East; \n
For many days hot grew the weather, \n
About the time of our Lady's Feast. \n
For many days we rode together, \n
Yet met we neither friend nor foe; \n
Hotter and clearer grew the weather, \n
Steadily did the East wind blow. \n
We saw the trees in the hot, bright weather, \n
Clear-cut, with shadows very black, \n
As freely we rode on together \n
With helms unlaced and bridles slack. \n
And often, as we rode together, \n
We, looking down the green-bank'd stream, \n
Saw flowers in the sunny weather, \n
And saw the bubble-making bream. \n
And in the night lay down together, \n
And hung above our heads the rood, \n
Or watch'd night-long in the dewy weather, \n
The while the moon did watch the wood. \n
Our spears stood bright and thick together, \n
Straight out the banners stream'd behind, \n
As we gallop'd on in the sunny weather, \n
With faces turn'd towards the wind. \n
Down sank our threescore spears together, \n
As thick we saw the pagans ride; \n
His eager face in the clear fresh weather, \n
Shone out that last time by my side. \n
Up the sweep of the bridge we dash'd together, \n
It rock'd to the crash of the meeting spears, \n
Down rain'd the buds of the dear spring weather, \n
The elm-tree flowers fell like tears. \n
There, as we roll'd and writhed together, \n
I threw my arms above my head, \n
For close by my side, in the lovely weather, \n
I saw him reel and fall back dead. \n
I and the slayer met together, \n
He waited the death-stroke there in his place, \n
With thoughts of death, in the lovely weather, \n
Gapingly mazed at my madden'd face. \n
Madly I fought as we fought together; \n
In vain: the little Christian band \n
The pagans drown'd, as in stormy weather \n
The river drowns low-lying land. \n
They bound my blood-stain'd hands together, \n
They bound his corpse to nod by my side: \n
Then on we rode, in the bright March weather, \n
With clash of cymbals did we ride. \n
We ride no more, no more together; \n
My prison-bars are thick and strong, \n
I take no heed of any weather, \n
The sweet Saints grant I live not long. \n<|endoftext|>
together \n
We're together... \n
But apart! \n
Together in body, \n
Apart in heart. \n

Out of the love \n
Which we had \n
At the start. \n
Only the children \n
Hold us together, \n
And the lives \n
We live each day. \n
But when you lie beside me, \n
In our cold bed at night, \n
We just lie there, together, apart, \n
And nothing is right. \n
I long for what we had, \n
When all that we did, \n
We did together, \n
But your heart left me, \n
And we only remain \n
Together, Apart. \n

It was over fifty years ago \n
They met and something clicked \n
After all the folks they had met before \n
They found the perfect person to pick \n
Larry and Lois had a purpose \n
They knew the direction they’d go \n
Nothing would stand in their way \n
Because they loved each other so \n
So marriage was inevitable \n
In time the couple had three boys \n
Working together to raise their family \n
Patience was always employed \n
They took their vows seriously \n
Trudging down life’s worn pathway \n
Keeping that strong firm direction \n
Always meeting one another half way \n
Of course there were a few hills \n
And at times some stormy weather \n
But the main thing that was important \n
Was they climbed those hills together \n
And now those fifty years are past \n
And their happiness isn’t just a rumor \n
Their beautiful smiles are evidence \n
Along with a great sense of humor! \n<|endoftext|>

Love. \n
Indeed the strongest word ever. \n
Love + You = Our Life Together. \n
Now I know it's obvious. \n
That you love me more than ever. \n
Let's cut the small talk & be together. \n
On a candlelit evening. \n
I imagine us together. \n
Happiness & good weather. \n
All the good times with you get better & better. \n
But the bad times with you. \n
I'm still glad that we're together. \n
So love me in the morning, noon, and the evening. \n
Forever. \n
Always stay true to this. \n
And we'll always be together. \n

We arrived at our home that night separately in the same car. \n
He needed to speak. \n
I needed silence. \n
He needed time together. \n
I needed time alone. \n
He needed to prove a point. \n
I had nothing to prove. \n
He said he was leaving. \n
I said leave the key on the table. \n
He asked did I even care? \n
I just stared… \n
He glared… \n
He wanted to fight. \n
I had no fury. \n
I have nothing left… \n
We've been through this before. \n
Another battle in an on going war. \n
It's time to put down our bags, \n
And wave the flag. \n
Love did not win. \n
She may live deep within, but's it's too long of a journey to the surface. \n
He says I'm moody \n
And after all this time he'scompletely blind \n
How? ? ? ? after 6 years can he not understand me? \n
We wasted so much time, \n
But still produced beautiful memories. \n
We don't have to ask what happened to us. \n
It happened...and now we will deal with it. \n
We'll heal. \n
Grieve. \n
Cuss. \n
Spit. \n
& blame. \n
Be ashamed, and have to explain, \n
to family and friends who will takes sides. \n
Your family will blame me because they can't see, \n
The side of you that lives with me, and vise versa... \n
It could've been something beautiful \n
I gave plentifully \n
But even completely, at times is not enough \n
We've tested the weather \n
Yet still live separately together \n
It's time to live completely alone. \n

Long back \n
When you were you \n
And I was I \n
We walked together side by side \n
Trying to keep our thoughts \n
Hand in hand \n
Fumbling for sameness \n
And painting for an abstract future \n
We walked together awake or in slumber \n
Holding the thought of togetherness \n
In the midst of a vortex \n
Then \n
We walked together \n
Step in step \n
When I became you \n
And you became me \n
We walked miles together \n
Having together a sip of life \n
Even if it was sweet or elixir \n
Bitter or with venom \n
Tasting each other's tears \n
imaging inner souls and \n
flying high and falling down to hell \n
we walked together \n
Suddenly \n
a thought of teasing \n
you vanish as a dewdropp \n
but still we walk together \n
it's not for others but I feel your touch \n
holding my little finger \n
to transfer unseen strength \n
to complete the journey \n
we walk together \n
my slow steps in your long strides \n
my tired soul \n
getting consoled in your unseen hands \n
my feathery body \n
leaning on your shoulder \n
we walk together \n
day and night \n
till the twilight of life \n

Why does mankind hate people based on religion and race? \n
Is it ignorance, education, or governments deciding our place. \n
For people are people regardless of the color of their face. \n
And the love in our hearts is an example of God's grace. \n
European people are the most powerful people under the sun. \n
Asians, Blacks, and Jews are constantly under the economic gun. \n
But people should not be exploited because of the color of skin. \n
White people must reject racism for a world of love to begin. \n
But are not Blacks, Jews, and Asians also guilty of racism? \n
For some of their religious leaders are advocates of separatism. \n
Now all people, whites, Asians, Jews,and Blacks, live on earth. \n
For racism will show God how much our souls are really worth. \n
All people will die and their bodies will stink becoming dirt. \n
And the devil will have the souls of all racist to forever hurt. \n
For Love is the most powerful force throughout the world. \n
Conquering all obstacles and causing racist minds to whirl. \n
We can't take money religion family or hate when we die. \n
But we can take love, and send it back to those who will cry. \n
For only love will cure any grieving and lonely heart. \n
And cause a no-good son or daughter to give life another start. \n
People are just human beings regardless of their ethnic pride. \n
So people should try to constantly look spiritually inside. \n
So forget about religion racism and discriminating government. \n
Because only Brotherhood will eliminate all bills and the rent. \n<|endoftext|>

Take me away with you my love \n
Let us go far away where the world is silent \n
Hold my heart close to your heart with love \n
Let us feel the beauty of love in our soul \n
When those stars make romantic nights \n
Let our hearts melt down with our deep emotions \n
When those nights bring moonlight on our body \n
Let us cover and roll with our 'love blanket' \n
When those trees dance with evening breeze \n
Let us dance with our world of dreams \n
When those ocean waves rolling high with sound \n

When our arms around each others and makes us comfort \n

Until on the strand \n

My anchor cast forth where the breeze blows no more, \n
And Creation's last boundary stands on the shore. \n
I saw infant stars into being arise, \n
For thousands of years to roll on through the skies; \n
I saw them in play \n
Seek their goal far away,-- \n
For a moment my fugitive gaze wandered on,-- \n
I looked round me, and lo!--all those bright stars had flown! \n
Madly yearning to reach the dark kingdom of night. \n
I boldly steer on with the speed of the light; \n
All misty and drear \n
The dim heavens appear, \n
While embryo systems and seas at their source \n
Are whirling around the sun-wanderer's course. \n
When sudden a pilgrim I see drawing near \n
Along the lone path,--"Stay! What seekest thou here?" \n
"My bark, tempest-tossed, \n
I sail toward the land where the breeze blows no more, \n
And Creation's last boundary stands on the shore." \n
"Stay, thou sailest in vain! 'Tis INFINITY yonder!"-- \n
"'Tis INFINITY, too, where thou, pilgrim, wouldst wander! \n

Is calm, itself is summer and night, itself \n

Within my nature's shell I slumber curled, \n
Unmindful of the changing outer skies, \n
Where now, perchance, some new-born Eros flies, \n
Or some old Cronos from his throne is hurled. \n
I heed them not; or if the subtle night \n
Haunt me with deities I never saw, \n

In his cool hall, with haggard eyes, \n
The Roman noble lay; \n
He drove abroad, in furious guise, \n
Along the Appian way. \n
He made a feast, drank fierce and fast, \n
And crowned his hair with flowers - \n
No easier nor no quicker passed \n
The impracticable hours. \n
The brooding East with awe beheld \n
Her impious younger world. \n
The Roman tempest swelled and swelled, \n
And on her head was hurled. \n
The East bowed low before the blast \n
In patient, deep disdain; \n
She let the legions thunder past, \n
And plunged in thought again. \n
So well she mused, a morning broke \n
Across her spirit grey; \n
A conquering, new-born joy awoke, \n
And filled her life with day. \n
'Poor world,' she cried, 'so deep accurst \n
That runn'st from pole to pole \n
To seek a draught to slake thy thirst - \n
Go, seek it in thy soul!' \n
She heard it, the victorious West, \n
In crown and sword arrayed! \n
She felt the void which mined her breast, \n
She shivered and obeyed. \n
She veiled her eagles, snapped her sword, \n
And laid her sceptre down; \n
Her stately purple she abhorred, \n
And her imperial crown. \n
She broke her flutes, she stopped her sports, \n
Her artists could not please; \n
She tore her books, she shut her courts, \n
She fled her palaces; \n
Lust of the eye and pride of life \n
She left it all behind, \n
And hurried, torn with inward strife, \n
The wilderness to find. \n
Tears washed the trouble from her face! \n
She changed into a child! \n
Mid weeds and wrecks she stood -a place \n
Of ruin -but she smiled! \n<|endoftext|>

1 I saw Eternity the other night, \n
2 Like a great ring of pure and endless light, \n
3 All calm, as it was bright; \n
4 And round beneath it, Time in hours, days, years, \n
5 Driv'n by the spheres \n
6 Like a vast shadow mov'd; in which the world \n
7 And all her train were hurl'd. \n
8 The doting lover in his quaintest strain \n
9 Did there complain; \n
10 Near him, his lute, his fancy, and his flights, \n
11 Wit's sour delights, \n
12 With gloves, and knots, the silly snares of pleasure, \n
13 Yet his dear treasure \n
14 All scatter'd lay, while he his eyes did pour \n
15 Upon a flow'r. \n
16 The darksome statesman hung with weights and woe, \n
17 Like a thick midnight-fog mov'd there so slow, \n
18 He did not stay, nor go; \n
19 Condemning thoughts (like sad eclipses) scowl \n
20 Upon his soul, \n
21 And clouds of crying witnesses without \n
22 Pursued him with one shout. \n
23 Yet digg'd the mole, and lest his ways be found, \n
24 Work'd under ground, \n
25 Where he did clutch his prey; but one did see \n
26 That policy; \n
27 Churches and altars fed him; perjuries \n
28 Were gnats and flies; \n
29 It rain'd about him blood and tears, but he \n
30 Drank them as free. \n
31 The fearful miser on a heap of rust \n
32 Sate pining all his life there, did scarce trust \n
33 His own hands with the dust, \n
34 Yet would not place one piece above, but lives \n
35 In fear of thieves; \n
36 Thousands there were as frantic as himself, \n
37 And hugg'd each one his pelf; \n
38 The downright epicure plac'd heav'n in sense, \n
39 And scorn'd pretence, \n
40 While others, slipp'd into a wide excess, \n
41 Said little less; \n
42 The weaker sort slight, trivial wares enslave, \n
43 Who think them brave; \n
44 And poor despised Truth sate counting by \n
45 Their victory. \n
46 Yet some, who all this while did weep and sing, \n
47 And sing, and weep, soar'd up into the ring; \n
48 But most would use no wing. \n
49 O fools (said I) thus to prefer dark night \n
50 Before true light, \n
51 To live in grots and caves, and hate the day \n
52 Because it shews the way, \n
53 The way, which from this dead and dark abode \n
54 Leads up to God, \n
55 A way where you might tread the sun, and be \n
56 More bright than he. \n

ALCESTIS \n
Shall I never make him look at me again? \n
I look at him, I look my life at him, \n
I tell him all I know the way to tell, \n
But there he stays the same. \n
Shall I never make him speak one word to me? \n
Shall I never make him say enough to show \n
My heart if he be glad? Be glad? … ah! God, \n
Why did they bring me back? \n
I wonder, if I go to him again, \n
If I take him by those two cold hands again, \n
Shall I get one look of him at last, or feel \n
One sign—or anything? \n
Or will he still sit there in the same way, \n
Without an answer for me from his lips, \n
Or from his eyes,—or even with a touch \n
Of his hand on my hand?… \n
“Will you look down this once—look down at me? \n
Speak once—and if you never speak again, \n
Tell me enough—tell me enough to make \n
Me know that you are glad! \n
“You are my King, and once my King would speak: \n
You were Admetus once, you loved me once: \n
Life was a dream of heaven for us once— \n
And has the dream gone by? \n
“Do I cling to shadows when I call you Life? \n
Do you love me still, or are the shadows all? \n
Or is it I that love you in the grave, \n
And you that mourn for me? \n
“If it be that, then do not mourn for me; \n
Be glad that I have loved you, and be King. \n
But if it be not that—if it be true … \n
Tell me if it be true!” \n
Then with a choking answer the King spoke; \n
But never touched his hand on hers, or fixed \n
His eyes on hers, or on the face of her: \n
“Yes, it is true,” he said. \n
“You are alive, and you are with me now; \n
And you are reaching up to me that I— \n
That I may take you—I that am a King— \n
I that was once a man." \n
So then she knew. She might have known before; \n
Truly, she thought, she must have known it long \n
Before: she must have known it when she came \n
From that great sleep of hers. \n
She knew the truth, but not yet all of it: \n
He loved her, but he would not let his eyes \n
Prove that he loved her; and he would not hold \n
His wife there in his arms. \n
So, like a slave, she waited at his knees, \n
And waited. She was not unhappy now. \n
She quivered, but she knew that he would speak \n
Again—and he did speak. \n
And while she felt the tremor of his words, \n
He told her all there was for him to tell; \n
And then he turned his face to meet her face, \n
That she might look at him. \n
She looked; and all her trust was in that look, \n
And all her faith was in it, and her love; \n
And when his answer to that look came back, \n
It flashed back through his tears. \n
So then she put her arms around his neck, \n
And kissed him on his forehead and his lips; \n
And there she clung, fast in his arms again, \n
Triumphant, with closed eyes. \n
At last, half whispering, she spoke once more: \n
“Why was it that you suffered for so long? \n
Why could you not believe me—trust in me? \n
Was I so strange as that? \n
“We suffer when we do not understand; \n
And you have suffered—you that love me now— \n
Because you are a man.… There is one thing \n
No man can understand. \n
“I would have given everything?—gone down \n
To Tartarus—to silence? Was it that? \n
I would have died? I would have let you live?— \n

One spoke: "Come, let us gaily go \n
With laughter, love and lust, \n
Since in a century or so \n
We'll all be boneyard dust. \n
When unborn shadows hold the screen, \n
(Our betters, I'll allow) \n
'Twill be as if we'd never been, \n
A hundred years from now. \n
When we have played life's lively game \n
Right royally we'll rot, \n
And not a soul will care a damn \n
The why or how we fought; \n
To grub for gold or grab for fame \n
Or raise a holy row, \n
It will be all the bloody same \n
A hundred years from now." \n
Said I: "Look! I have built a tower \n
Upon you lonely hill, \n
Designed to be a daughter's dower, \n
Yet when my heart is still, \n
The stone I set with horny hand \n
And salty sweat of brow, \n
A record of my strength will sand \n
A hundred years from now. \n
"There's nothing lost and nothing vain \n
In all this world so wide; \n
The ocean hoards each drop of rain \n
To swell its sweeping tide; \n
The desert seeks each grain of sand \n
It's empire to endow, \n
And we a bright brave world have planned \n
A hundred years from now. \n
And all we are and all we do \n
Will bring that world to be; \n
Our strain and pain let us not rue, \n
Though other eyes shall see; \n
For other hearts will bravely beat \n
And lips will sing of how \n
We strove to make life sane and sweet \n
A hundred years from now. \n<|endoftext|>

I. \n
Ah! wherefore by the Church-yard side, \n
Poor little LORN ONE, dost thou stray? \n
Thy wavy locks but thinly hide \n
The tears that dim thy blue-eye's ray; \n
And wherefore dost thou sigh, and moan, \n
And weep, that thou art left alone? \n
II. \n
Thou art not left alone, poor boy, \n
The Trav'ller stops to hear thy tale; \n
No heart, so hard, would thee annoy! \n
For tho' thy mother's cheek is pale \n
And withers under yon grave stone, \n
Thou art not, Urchin, left alone. \n
III. \n
I know thee well ! thy yellow hair \n
In silky waves I oft have seen; \n
Thy dimpled face, so fresh and fair, \n
Thy roguish smile, thy playful mien \n
Were all to me, poor Orphan, known, \n
Ere Fate had left thee--all alone! \n
IV. \n
Thy russet coat is scant, and torn, \n
Thy cheek is now grown deathly pale! \n
Thy eyes are dim, thy looks forlorn, \n
And bare thy bosom meets the gale; \n
And oft I hear thee deeply groan, \n
That thou, poor boy, art left alone. \n
V. \n
Thy naked feet are wounded sore \n
With thorns, that cross thy daily road; \n
The winter winds around thee roar, \n
The church-yard is thy bleak abode; \n
Thy pillow now, a cold grave stone-- \n
And there thou lov'st to grieve--alone! \n
VI. \n
The rain has drench'd thee, all night long; \n
The nipping frost thy bosom froze; \n
And still, the yewtree-shades among, \n
I heard thee sigh thy artless woes; \n
I heard thee, till the day-star shone \n
In darkness weep--and weep alone! \n
VII. \n
Oft have I seen thee, little boy, \n
Upon thy lovely mother's knee; \n
For when she liv'd--thou wert her joy, \n
Though now a mourner thou must be! \n
For she lies low, where yon grave-stone \n
Proclaims, that thou art left alone. \n
VIII. \n
Weep, weep no more; on yonder hill \n
The village bells are ringing, gay; \n
The merry reed, and brawling rill \n
Call thee to rustic sports away. \n
Then wherefore weep, and sigh, and moan, \n
A truant from the throng--alone? \n
IX. \n
"I cannot the green hill ascend, \n
"I cannot pace the upland mead; \n
"I cannot in the vale attend, \n
"To hear the merry-sounding reed: \n
"For all is still, beneath yon stone, \n
"Where my poor mother's left alone! \n
X. \n
"I cannot gather gaudy flowers \n
"To dress the scene of revels loud-- \n
"I cannot pass the ev'ning hours \n

"See how the stars begin to gleam \n
"The sheep-dog barks, 'tis time to go;-- \n

"It falls upon the white grave-stone, \n
"Where my dear mother sleeps alone.-- \n
XII. \n
"O stay me not, for I must go \n
"The upland path in haste to tread; \n
"For there the pale primroses grow \n
"They grow to dress my mother's bed.-- \n
"They must, ere peep of day, be strown, \n
"Where she lies mould'ring all alone. \n
XIII. \n
"My father o'er the stormy sea \n
"To distant lands was borne away, \n
"And still my mother stay'd with me \n

"And shall I ever quit the stone \n
"Where she is, left, to sleep alone. \n
XIV. \n
"My father died; and still I found \n
"My mother fond and kind to me; \n
"I felt her breast with rapture bound \n
"When first I prattled on her knee-- \n
"And then she blest my infant tone \n
"And little thought of yon grave-stone. \n
XV. \n
"No more her gentle voice I hear, \n
"No more her smile of fondness see; \n
"Then wonder not I shed the tear \n
"She would have DIED, to follow me! \n
"And yet she sleeps beneath yon stone \n
"And I STILL LIVE--to weep alone. \n
XVI. \n
"The playful kid, she lov'd so well \n
"From yon high clift was seen to fall; \n
"I heard, afar, his tink'ling bell-- \n
"Which seem'd in vain for aid to call-- \n
"I heard the harmless suff'rer moan, \n
"And grieved that he was left alone. \n
XVII. \n
"Our faithful dog grew mad, and died, \n
"The lightning smote our cottage low-- \n
"We had no resting-place beside \n
"And knew not whither we should go,-- \n
"For we were poor,--and hearts of stone \n
"Will never throb at mis'ry's groan. \n
XVIII. \n
"My mother still surviv'd for me, \n
"She led me to the mountain's brow, \n
"She watch'd me, while at yonder tree \n
"I sat, and wove the ozier bough; \n
"And oft she cried, "fear not, MINE OWN! \n
"Thou shalt not, BOY, be left ALONE." \n
XXI. \n
"The blast blew strong, the torrent rose \n
"And bore our shatter'd cot away; \n
"And, where the clear brook swiftly flows-- \n
"Upon the turf at dawn of day, \n
"When bright the sun's full lustre shone, \n
"I wander'd, FRIENDLESS--and ALONE!" \n
XX. \n
Thou art not, boy, for I have seen \n
Thy tiny footsteps print the dew, \n
And while the morning sky serene \n
Spread o'er the hill a yellow hue, \n
I heard thy sad and plaintive moan, \n
Beside the cold sepulchral stone. \n
XXI. \n
And when the summer noontide hours \n
With scorching rays the landscape spread, \n
I mark'd thee, weaving fragrant flow'rs \n
To deck thy mother's silent bed! \n
Nor, at the church-yard's simple stone, \n
Wert, thou, poor Urchin, left alone. \n
XXII. \n
I follow'd thee, along the dale \n
And up the woodland's shad'wy way: \n
I heard thee tell thy mournful tale \n
As slowly sunk the star of day: \n
Nor, when its twinkling light had flown, \n
Wert thou a wand'rer, all alone. \n
XXIII. \n
"O! yes, I was! and still shall be \n
"A wand'rer, mourning and forlorn; \n
"For what is all the world to me-- \n
"What are the dews and buds of morn? \n
"Since she, who left me sad, alone \n

XXV. \n
"My Father never will return, \n
"He rests beneath the sea-green wave; \n

AS I sat alone, by blue Ontario's shore, \n
As I mused of these mighty days, and of peace return'd, and the dead \n
that return no more, \n
A Phantom, gigantic, superb, with stern visage, accosted me; \n
Chant me the poem, it said, that comes from the soul of America-- \n
chant me the carol of victory; \n
And strike up the marches of Libertad--marches more powerful yet; \n
And sing me before you go, the song of the throes of Democracy. \n
(Democracy--the destin'd conqueror--yet treacherous lip-smiles \n
everywhere, \n
And Death and infidelity at every step.) \n
A Nation announcing itself, \n
I myself make the only growth by which I can be appreciated, 10 \n
I reject none, accept all, then reproduce all in my own forms. \n
A breed whose proof is in time and deeds; \n
What we are, we are--nativity is answer enough to objections; \n
We wield ourselves as a weapon is wielded, \n
We are powerful and tremendous in ourselves, \n
We are executive in ourselves--We are sufficient in the variety of \n
ourselves, \n
We are the most beautiful to ourselves, and in ourselves; \n
We stand self-pois'd in the middle, branching thence over the world; \n
From Missouri, Nebraska, or Kansas, laughing attacks to scorn. \n
Nothing is sinful to us outside of ourselves, 20 \n
Whatever appears, whatever does not appear, we are beautiful or \n
sinful in ourselves only. \n
(O mother! O sisters dear! \n
If we are lost, no victor else has destroy'd us; \n
It is by ourselves we go down to eternal night.) \n
Have you thought there could be but a single Supreme? \n
There can be any number of Supremes--One does not countervail \n
another, any more than one eyesight countervails another, or \n
one life countervails another. \n
All is eligible to all, \n
All is for individuals--All is for you, \n
No condition is prohibited--not God's, or any. \n
All comes by the body--only health puts you rapport with the \n
universe. 30 \n
Produce great persons, the rest follows. \n
America isolated I sing; \n
I say that works made here in the spirit of other lands, are so much \n
poison in The States. \n
(How dare such insects as we see assume to write poems for America? \n
For our victorious armies, and the offspring following the armies?) \n
Piety and conformity to them that like! \n
Peace, obesity, allegiance, to them that like! \n
I am he who tauntingly compels men, women, nations, \n
Crying, Leap from your seats, and contend for your lives! \n
I am he who walks the States with a barb'd tongue, questioning every \n
one I meet; 40 \n
Who are you, that wanted only to be told what you knew before? \n
Who are you, that wanted only a book to join you in your nonsense? \n
(With pangs and cries, as thine own, O bearer of many children! \n
These clamors wild, to a race of pride I give.) \n
O lands! would you be freer than all that has ever been before? \n
If you would be freer than all that has been before, come listen to \n
me. \n
Fear grace--Fear elegance, civilization, delicatesse, \n
Fear the mellow sweet, the sucking of honey-juice; \n
Beware the advancing mortal ripening of nature, \n
Beware what precedes the decay of the ruggedness of states and \n
men. 50 \n
Ages, precedents, have long been accumulating undirected materials, \n
America brings builders, and brings its own styles. \n
The immortal poets of Asia and Europe have done their work, and \n
pass'd to other spheres, \n
A work remains, the work of surpassing all they have done. \n
America, curious toward foreign characters, stands by its own at all \n
hazards, \n
Stands removed, spacious, composite, sound--initiates the true use of \n
precedents, \n
Does not repel them, or the past, or what they have produced under \n
their forms, \n
Takes the lesson with calmness, perceives the corpse slowly borne \n
from the house, \n
Perceives that it waits a little while in the door--that it was \n
fittest for its days, \n
That its life has descended to the stalwart and well-shaped heir who \n
approaches, 60 \n
And that he shall be fittest for his days. \n
Any period, one nation must lead, \n
One land must be the promise and reliance of the future. \n
These States are the amplest poem, \n
Here is not merely a nation, but a teeming nation of nations, \n
Here the doings of men correspond with the broadcast doings of the \n
day and night, \n
Here is what moves in magnificent masses, careless of particulars, \n
Here are the roughs, beards, friendliness, combativeness, the Soul \n
loves, \n
Here the flowing trains--here the crowds, equality, diversity, the \n
Soul loves. \n
Land of lands, and bards to corroborate! 70 \n
Of them, standing among them, one lifts to the light his west-bred \n
face, \n
To him the hereditary countenance bequeath'd, both mother's and \n
father's, \n
His first parts substances, earth, water, animals, trees, \n
Built of the common stock, having room for far and near, \n
Used to dispense with other lands, incarnating this land, \n
Attracting it Body and Soul to himself, hanging on its neck with \n
incomparable love, \n
Plunging his seminal muscle into its merits and demerits, \n
Making its cities, beginnings, events, diversities, wars, vocal in \n
him, \n
Making its rivers, lakes, bays, embouchure in him, \n
Mississippi with yearly freshets and changing chutes--Columbia, \n
Niagara, Hudson, spending themselves lovingly in him, 80 \n
If the Atlantic coast stretch, or the Pacific coast stretch, he \n
stretching with them north or south, \n
Spanning between them, east and west, and touching whatever is \n
between them, \n
Growths growing from him to offset the growth of pine, cedar, \n
hemlock, live-oak, locust, chestnut, hickory, cottonwood, \n
orange, magnolia, \n
Tangles as tangled in him as any cane-brake or swamp, \n
He likening sides and peaks of mountains, forests coated with \n
northern transparent ice, \n
Off him pasturage, sweet and natural as savanna, upland, prairie, \n
Through him flights, whirls, screams, answering those of the fish- \n
hawk, mocking-bird, night-heron, and eagle; \n
His spirit surrounding his country's spirit, unclosed to good and \n
evil, \n
Surrounding the essences of real things, old times and present times, \n
Surrounding just found shores, islands, tribes of red aborigines, 90 \n
Weather-beaten vessels, landings, settlements, embryo stature and \n
muscle, \n
The haughty defiance of the Year 1--war, peace, the formation of the \n
Constitution, \n
The separate States, the simple, elastic scheme, the immigrants, \n
The Union, always swarming with blatherers, and always sure and \n
impregnable, \n
The unsurvey'd interior, log-houses, clearings, wild animals, \n
hunters, trappers; \n
Surrounding the multiform agriculture, mines, temperature, the \n
gestation of new States, \n
Congress convening every Twelfth-month, the members duly coming up \n
from the uttermost parts; \n
Surrounding the noble character of mechanics and farmers, especially \n
the young men, \n
Responding their manners, speech, dress, friendships--the gait they \n
have of persons who never knew how it felt to stand in the \n
presence of superiors, \n
The freshness and candor of their physiognomy, the copiousness and \n
decision of their phrenology, 100 \n
The picturesque looseness of their carriage, their fierceness when \n
wrong'd, \n
The fluency of their speech, their delight in music, their curiosity, \n
good temper, and open-handedness--the whole composite make, \n
The prevailing ardor and enterprise, the large amativeness, \n
The perfect equality of the female with the male, the fluid movement \n
of the population, \n
The superior marine, free commerce, fisheries, whaling, gold-digging, \n
Wharf-hemm'd cities, railroad and steamboat lines, intersecting all \n
points, \n
Factories, mercantile life, labor-saving machinery, the north-east, \n
north-west, south-west, \n
Manhattan firemen, the Yankee swap, southern plantation life, \n
Slavery--the murderous, treacherous conspiracy to raise it upon the \n
ruins of all the rest; \n
On and on to the grapple with it--Assassin! then your life or ours be \n
the stake--and respite no more. 110 \n
(Lo! high toward heaven, this day, \n
Libertad! from the conqueress' field return'd, \n
I mark the new aureola around your head; \n
No more of soft astral, but dazzling and fierce, \n
With war's flames, and the lambent lightnings playing, \n
And your port immovable where you stand; \n
With still the inextinguishable glance, and the clench'd and lifted \n
fist, \n
And your foot on the neck of the menacing one, the scorner, utterly \n
crush'd beneath you; \n
The menacing, arrogant one, that strode and advanced with his \n
senseless scorn, bearing the murderous knife; \n
--Lo! the wide swelling one, the braggart, that would yesterday do so \n
much! 120 \n
To-day a carrion dead and damn'd, the despised of all the earth! \n
An offal rank, to the dunghill maggots spurn'd.) \n
Others take finish, but the Republic is ever constructive, and ever \n
keeps vista; \n
Others adorn the past--but you, O days of the present, I adorn you! \n
O days of the future, I believe in you! I isolate myself for your \n
sake; \n
O America, because you build for mankind, I build for you! \n
O well-beloved stone-cutters! I lead them who plan with decision and \n
science, \n
I lead the present with friendly hand toward the future. \n
Bravas to all impulses sending sane children to the next age! \n
But damn that which spends itself, with no thought of the stain, \n
pains, dismay, feebleness it is bequeathing. 130 \n
I listened to the Phantom by Ontario's shore, \n
I heard the voice arising, demanding bards; \n
By them, all native and grand--by them alone can The States be fused \n
into the compact organism of a Nation. \n
To hold men together by paper and seal, or by compulsion, is no \n
account; \n
That only holds men together which aggregates all in a living \n
principle, as the hold of the limbs of the body, or the fibres \n
of plants. \n
Of all races and eras, These States, with veins full of poetical \n
stuff, most need poets, and are to have the greatest, and use \n
them the greatest; \n
Their Presidents shall not be their common referee so much as their \n
poets shall. \n
(Soul of love, and tongue of fire! \n
Eye to pierce the deepest deeps, and sweep the world! \n
--Ah, mother! prolific and full in all besides--yet how long barren, \n
barren?) 140 \n
Of These States, the poet is the equable man, \n
Not in him, but off from him, things are grotesque, eccentric, fail \n
of their full returns, \n
Nothing out of its place is good, nothing in its place is bad, \n
He bestows on every object or quality its fit proportion, neither \n
more nor less, \n
He is the arbiter of the diverse, he is the key, \n
He is the equalizer of his age and land, \n
He supplies what wants supplying--he checks what wants checking, \n
In peace, out of him speaks the spirit of peace, large, rich, \n
thrifty, building populous towns, encouraging agriculture, \n
arts, commerce, lighting the study of man, the Soul, health, \n
immortality, government; \n
In war, he is the best backer of the war--he fetches artillery as \n
good as the engineer's--he can make every word he speaks draw \n
blood; \n
The years straying toward infidelity, he withholds by his steady \n
faith, 150 \n
He is no argurer, he is judgment--(Nature accepts him absolutely;) \n
He judges not as the judge judges, but as the sun falling round a \n
helpless thing; \n
As he sees the farthest, he has the most faith, \n
His thoughts are the hymns of the praise of things, \n
In the dispute on God and eternity he is silent, \n
He sees eternity less like a play with a prologue and denouement, \n
He sees eternity in men and women--he does not see men and women as \n
dreams or dots. \n
For the great Idea, the idea of perfect and free individuals, \n
For that idea the bard walks in advance, leader of leaders, \n
The attitude of him cheers up slaves and horrifies foreign \n
despots. 160 \n
Without extinction is Liberty! without retrograde is Equality! \n
They live in the feelings of young men, and the best women; \n
Not for nothing have the indomitable heads of the earth been always \n
ready to fall for Liberty. \n
For the great Idea! \n
That, O my brethren--that is the mission of Poets. \n
Songs of stern defiance, ever ready, \n
Songs of the rapid arming, and the march, \n
The flag of peace quick-folded, and instead, the flag we know, \n
Warlike flag of the great Idea. \n
(Angry cloth I saw there leaping! 170 \n
I stand again in leaden rain, your flapping folds saluting; \n
I sing you over all, flying, beckoning through the fight--O the hard- \n
contested fight! \n
O the cannons ope their rosy-flashing muzzles! the hurtled balls \n
scream! \n
The battle-front forms amid the smoke--the volleys pour incessant \n
from the line; \n
Hark! the ringing word, Charge!--now the tussle, and the furious \n
maddening yells; \n
Now the corpses tumble curl'd upon the ground, \n
Cold, cold in death, for precious life of you, \n
Angry cloth I saw there leaping.) \n
Are you he who would assume a place to teach, or be a poet here in \n
The States? \n
The place is august--the terms obdurate. 180 \n
Who would assume to teach here, may well prepare himself, body and \n
mind, \n
He may well survey, ponder, arm, fortify, harden, make lithe, \n
himself, \n
He shall surely be question'd beforehand by me with many and stern \n
questions. \n
Who are you, indeed, who would talk or sing to America? \n
Have you studied out the land, its idioms and men? \n
Have you learn'd the physiology, phrenology, politics, geography, \n
pride, freedom, friendship, of the land? its substratums and \n
objects? \n
Have you consider'd the organic compact of the first day of the first \n
year of Independence, sign'd by the Commissioners, ratified by \n
The States, and read by Washington at the head of the army? \n
Have you possess'd yourself of the Federal Constitution? \n
Do you see who have left all feudal processes and poems behind them, \n
and assumed the poems and processes of Democracy? \n
Are you faithful to things? do you teach as the land and sea, the \n
bodies of men, womanhood, amativeness, angers, teach? 190 \n
Have you sped through fleeting customs, popularities? \n
Can you hold your hand against all seductions, follies, whirls, \n
fierce contentions? are you very strong? are you really of the \n
whole people? \n
Are you not of some coterie? some school or mere religion? \n
Are you done with reviews and criticisms of life? animating now to \n
life itself? \n
Have you vivified yourself from the maternity of These States? \n
Have you too the old, ever-fresh forbearance and impartiality? \n
Do you hold the like love for those hardening to maturity; for the \n
last-born? little and big? and for the errant? \n
What is this you bring my America? \n
Is it uniform with my country? \n
Is it not something that has been better told or done before? 200 \n
Have you not imported this, or the spirit of it, in some ship? \n
Is it not a mere tale? a rhyme? a prettiness? is the good old cause \n
in it? \n
Has it not dangled long at the heels of the poets, politicians, \n
literats, of enemies' lands? \n
Does it not assume that what is notoriously gone is still here? \n
Does it answer universal needs? will it improve manners? \n
Does it sound, with trumpet-voice, the proud victory of the Union, in \n
that secession war? \n
Can your performance face the open fields and the seaside? \n
Will it absorb into me as I absorb food, air--to appear again in my \n
strength, gait, face? \n
Have real employments contributed to it? original makers--not mere \n
amanuenses? \n
Does it meet modern discoveries, calibers, facts face to face? 210 \n
What does it mean to me? to American persons, progresses, cities? \n
Chicago, Kanada, Arkansas? the planter, Yankee, Georgian, \n
native, immigrant, sailors, squatters, old States, new States? \n
Does it encompass all The States, and the unexceptional rights of all \n
the men and women of the earth? (the genital impulse of These \n
States;) \n
Does it see behind the apparent custodians, the real custodians, \n
standing, menacing, silent--the mechanics, Manhattanese, \n
western men, southerners, significant alike in their apathy, \n
and in the promptness of their love? \n
Does it see what finally befalls, and has always finally befallen, \n
each temporizer, patcher, outsider, partialist, alarmist, \n
infidel, who has ever ask'd anything of America? \n
What mocking and scornful negligence? \n
The track strew'd with the dust of skeletons; \n
By the roadside others disdainfully toss'd. \n
Rhymes and rhymers pass away--poems distill'd from foreign poems pass \n
away, \n
The swarms of reflectors and the polite pass, and leave ashes; \n
Admirers, importers, obedient persons, make but the soul of \n
literature; 220 \n
America justifies itself, give it time--no disguise can deceive it, \n
or conceal from it--it is impassive enough, \n
Only toward the likes of itself will it advance to meet them, \n
If its poets appear, it will in due time advance to meet them--there \n
is no fear of mistake, \n
(The proof of a poet shall be sternly deferr'd, till his country \n
absorbs him as affectionately as he has absorb'd it.) \n
He masters whose spirit masters--he tastes sweetest who results \n
sweetest in the long run; \n
The blood of the brawn beloved of time is unconstraint; \n
In the need of poems, philosophy, politics, manners, engineering, an \n
appropriate native grand-opera, shipcraft, any craft, he or she \n
is greatest who contributes the greatest original practical \n
example. \n
Already a nonchalant breed, silently emerging, appears on the \n
streets, \n
People's lips salute only doers, lovers, satisfiers, positive \n
knowers; There will shortly be no more priests--I say their \n
work is done, 230 \n
Death is without emergencies here, but life is perpetual emergencies \n
here, \n
Are your body, days, manners, superb? after death you shall be \n
superb; \n
Justice, health, self-esteem, clear the way with irresistible power; \n
How dare you place anything before a man? \n
Fall behind me, States! \n
A man before all--myself, typical before all. \n
Give me the pay I have served for! \n
Give me to sing the song of the great Idea! take all the rest; \n
I have loved the earth, sun, animals--I have despised riches, \n
I have given alms to every one that ask'd, stood up for the stupid \n
and crazy, devoted my income and labor to others, 240 \n
I have hated tyrants, argued not concerning God, had patience and \n
indulgence toward the people, taken off my hat to nothing known \n
or unknown, \n
I have gone freely with powerful uneducated persons, and with the \n
young, and with the mothers of families, \n
I have read these leaves to myself in the open air--I have tried them \n
by trees, stars, rivers, \n
I have dismiss'd whatever insulted my own Soul or defiled my Body, \n
I have claim'd nothing to myself which I have not carefully claim'd \n
for others on the same terms, \n
I have sped to the camps, and comrades found and accepted from every \n
State; \n
(In war of you, as well as peace, my suit is good, America--sadly I \n
boast; \n
Upon this breast has many a dying soldier lean'd, to breathe his \n
last; \n
This arm, this hand, this voice, have nourish'd, rais'd, restored, \n
To life recalling many a prostrate form:) 250 \n
--I am willing to wait to be understood by the growth of the taste of \n
myself, \n
I reject none, I permit all. \n
(Say, O mother! have I not to your thought been faithful? \n
Have I not, through life, kept you and yours before me?) \n
I swear I begin to see the meaning of these things! \n
It is not the earth, it is not America, who is so great, \n
It is I who am great, or to be great--it is you up there, or any one; \n
It is to walk rapidly through civilizations, governments, theories, \n
Through poems, pageants, shows, to form great individuals. \n
Underneath all, individuals! 260 \n
I swear nothing is good to me now that ignores individuals, \n
The American compact is altogether with individuals, \n
The only government is that which makes minute of individuals, \n
The whole theory of the universe is directed to one single \n
individual--namely, to You. \n
(Mother! with subtle sense severe--with the naked sword in your hand, \n
I saw you at last refuse to treat but directly with individuals.) \n
Underneath all, nativity, \n
I swear I will stand by my own nativity--pious or impious, so be it; \n
I swear I am charm'd with nothing except nativity, \n
Men, women, cities, nations, are only beautiful from nativity. 270 \n
Underneath all is the need of the expression of love for men and \n
women, \n
I swear I have seen enough of mean and impotent modes of expressing \n
love for men and women, \n
After this day I take my own modes of expressing love for men and \n
women. \n
I swear I will have each quality of my race in myself, \n
(Talk as you like, he only suits These States whose manners favor the \n
audacity and sublime turbulence of The States.) \n
Underneath the lessons of things, spirits, Nature, governments, \n
ownerships, I swear I perceive other lessons, \n
Underneath all, to me is myself--to you, yourself--(the same \n
monotonous old song.) \n
O I see now, flashing, that this America is only you and me, \n
Its power, weapons, testimony, are you and me, \n
Its crimes, lies, thefts, defections, slavery, are you and me, 280 \n
Its Congress is you and me--the officers, capitols, armies, ships, \n
are you and me, \n
Its endless gestations of new States are you and me, \n
The war--that war so bloody and grim--the war I will henceforth \n
forget--was you and me, \n
Natural and artificial are you and me, \n
Freedom, language, poems, employments, are you and me, \n
Past, present, future, are you and me. \n
I swear I dare not shirk any part of myself, \n
Not any part of America, good or bad, \n
Not the promulgation of Liberty--not to cheer up slaves and horrify \n
foreign despots, \n
Not to build for that which builds for mankind, 290 \n
Not to balance ranks, complexions, creeds, and the sexes, \n
Not to justify science, nor the march of equality, \n
Nor to feed the arrogant blood of the brawn beloved of time. \n
I swear I am for those that have never been master'd! \n
For men and women whose tempers have never been master'd, \n
For those whom laws, theories, conventions, can never master. \n
I swear I am for those who walk abreast with the whole earth! \n
Who inaugurate one, to inaugurate all. \n
I swear I will not be outfaced by irrational things! \n
I will penetrate what it is in them that is sarcastic upon me! 300 \n
I will make cities and civilizations defer to me! \n
This is what I have learnt from America--it is the amount--and it I \n
teach again. \n
(Democracy! while weapons were everywhere aim'd at your breast, \n
I saw you serenely give birth to immortal children--saw in dreams \n
your dilating form; \n
Saw you with spreading mantle covering the world.) \n
I will confront these shows of the day and night! \n
I will know if I am to be less than they! \n
I will see if I am not as majestic as they! \n
I will see if I am not as subtle and real as they! \n
I will see if I am to be less generous than they! 310 \n
I will see if I have no meaning, while the houses and ships have \n
meaning! \n
I will see if the fishes and birds are to be enough for themselves, \n
and I am not to be enough for myself. \n
I match my spirit against yours, you orbs, growths, mountains, \n
brutes, \n
Copious as you are, I absorb you all in myself, and become the master \n
myself. \n
America isolated, yet embodying all, what is it finally except \n
myself? \n
These States--what are they except myself? \n
I know now why the earth is gross, tantalizing, wicked--it is for my \n
sake, \n
I take you to be mine, you beautiful, terrible, rude forms. \n
(Mother! bend down, bend close to me your face! \n
I know not what these plots and wars, and deferments are for; 320 \n
I know not fruition's success--but I know that through war and peace \n
your work goes on, and must yet go on.) \n
.... Thus, by blue Ontario's shore, \n
While the winds fann'd me, and the waves came trooping toward me, \n
I thrill'd with the Power's pulsations--and the charm of my theme was \n
upon me, \n
Till the tissues that held me, parted their ties upon me. \n
And I saw the free Souls of poets; \n
The loftiest bards of past ages strode before me, \n
Strange, large men, long unwaked, undisclosed, were disclosed to me. \n
O my rapt verse, my call--mock me not! \n
Not for the bards of the past--not to invoke them have I launch'd you \n
forth, 330 \n
Not to call even those lofty bards here by Ontario's shores, \n
Have I sung so capricious and loud, my savage song. \n
Bards for my own land, only, I invoke; \n
(For the war, the war is over--the field is clear'd,) \n
Till they strike up marches henceforth triumphant and onward, \n
To cheer, O mother, your boundless, expectant soul. \n
Bards grand as these days so grand! \n
Bards of the great Idea! Bards of the peaceful inventions! (for the \n
war, the war is over!) \n
Yet Bards of the latent armies--a million soldiers waiting, ever- \n
ready, \n
Bards towering like hills--(no more these dots, these pigmies, these \n
little piping straws, these gnats, that fill the hour, to pass \n
for poets;) 340 \n
Bards with songs as from burning coals, or the lightning's fork'd \n
stripes! \n
Ample Ohio's bards--bards for California! inland bards--bards of the \n
war;) \n
(As a wheel turns on its axle, so I find my chants turning finally on \n
the war;) \n
Bards of pride! Bards tallying the ocean's roar, and the swooping \n
eagle's scream! \n
You, by my charm, I invoke! \n<|endoftext|>

Wake up, Mom and Daddy. \n
We’ve got a BIG surprise. \n
Me and Sissy made you breakfast. \n
Please, open up your eyes. \n
Here’s the paper from the porch, \n
Just in case you want to read. \n
Please wake up and put your glasses on \n
so you guys can see. \n
There’s cereal with milk on it \n
and toast with butter, too. \n
(Sissy scraped the black stuff off) . \n
We made this ALL for you. \n
We didn’t make the coffee, \n
but, Mommy, that’s okay \n
‘cause me and Sissy found some \n
in the pot from yesterday. \n
The eggs look kind of funny, \n
not like the ones you make. \n
Ours are way too slickery. \n
They keep sliding off the plate. \n
We’re sorry there’s no muffin, \n
but there weren’t any more. \n
Well... the one that was left over \n
got smushed on the kitchen floor. \n
There used to be a donut, too, \n
and it was on the plate. \n
Me and Sissy got real hungry, \n
but it’s the only thing we ate. \n
When it comes to making breakfast, \n
there's a lot of work to do, \n
but we made it just to show you \n

In Daddy's bedroom down the hall, \n
there's a special place, The Birthday Wall. \n
Every year about this time, \n
he hugs me then he draws my line. \n
We look at where I used to be \n
when I was small and only three. \n
Much higher, then, the one for four, \n
then five, then six, and now one more. \n

Children, if you dare to think \n
Of the greatness, rareness, muchness \n
Fewness of this precious only \n
Endless world in which you say \n
You live, you think of things like this: \n
Blocks of slate enclosing dappled \n
Red and green, enclosing tawny \n
Yellow nets, enclosing white \n
And black acres of dominoes, \n
Where a neat brown paper parcel \n
Tempts you to untie the string. \n
In the parcel a small island, \n
On the island a large tree, \n
On the tree a husky fruit. \n
Strip the husk and pare the rind off: \n
In the kernel you will see \n
Blocks of slate enclosed by dappled \n
Red and green, enclosed by tawny \n
Yellow nets, enclosed by white \n
And black acres of dominoes, \n
Where the same brown paper parcel - \n
Children, leave the string alone! \n
For who dares undo the parcel \n
Finds himself at once inside it, \n
On the island, in the fruit, \n
Blocks of slate about his head, \n
Finds himself enclosed by dappled \n
Green and red, enclosed by yellow \n
Tawny nets, enclosed by black \n
And white acres of dominoes, \n
With the same brown paper parcel \n
Still untied upon his knee. \n
And, if he then should dare to think \n
Of the fewness, muchness, rareness, \n
Greatness of this endless only \n
Precious world in which he says \n
he lives - he then unties the string. \n<|endoftext|>

I know our tongues have jobs to do, \n
licking lips or tasting food. \n
They also help us say our words \n
and see if our teeth are smooth. \n
After that, a tongue gets stupid, \n
stupid, stupid tongue... \n
Tongues don't seem to listen \n
and tongues act really dumb. \n
When we have a sharp loose tooth, \n
we tell our tongue to stay away \n
because it's really sharp right there \n
but tongues just won't behave. \n
Your tongue gets sore and it hurts to talk. \n
Your brain says, 'Tongue, don't take that walk! ' \n
but tongues won't listen (or tongues don't care) , \n
and pretty soon it goes back there, \n
the more it does, the more it hurts. \n
It just won't listen and I don't know \n
why it sneaks right back \n

How soon, my Dear, death may my steps attend, \n
How soon't may be thy lot to lose thy friend, \n

Let be interred in my oblivious grave; \n
If any worth or virtue were in me, \n

And when thou feel'st no grief, as I no harmes, \n
Yet love thy dead, who long lay in thine arms, \n
And when thy loss shall be repaid with gains \n
Look to my little babes, my dear remains. \n
And if thou love thyself, or loved'st me, \n
These O protect from stepdame's injury. \n
And if chance to thine eyes shall bring this verse, \n

spring \n
I \n
Ah, who will tell me, in these leaden days, \n
Why the sweet Spring delays, \n
And where she hides, -- the dear desire \n
Of every heart that longs \n
For bloom, and fragrance, and the ruby fire \n
Of maple-buds along the misty hills, \n
And that immortal call which fills \n
The waiting wood with songs? \n
The snow-drops came so long ago, \n
It seemed that Spring was near! \n
But then returned the snow \n
With biting winds, and all the earth grew sere, \n
And sullen clouds drooped low \n
To veil the sadness of a hope deferred: \n
Then rain, rain, rain, incessant rain \n
Beat on the window-pane, \n
Through which I watched the solitary bird \n
That braved the tempest, buffeted and tossed, \n
With rumpled feathers, down the wind again. \n
Oh, were the seeds all lost \n
When winter laid the wild flowers in their tomb? \n
I searched their haunts in vain \n
For blue hepaticas, and trilliums white, \n
And trailing arbutus, the Spring's delight, \n
Starring the withered leaves with rosy bloom. \n
The woods were bare: and every night the frost \n
To all my longings spoke a silent nay, \n
And told me Spring was far and far away. \n
Even the robins were too cold to sing, \n
Except a broken and discouraged note, -- \n
Only the tuneful sparrow, on whose throat \n
Music has put her triple finger-print, \n
Lifted his head and sang my heart a hint, -- \n
"Wait, wait, wait! oh, wait a while for Spring!" \n
II \n
But now, Carina, what divine amends \n
For all delay! What sweetness treasured up, \n
What wine of joy that blends \n
A hundred flavours in a single cup, \n
Is poured into this perfect day! \n
For look, sweet heart, here are the early flowers, \n
That lingered on their way, \n
Thronging in haste to kiss the feet of May, \n
And mingled with the bloom of later hours, -- \n
Anemonies and cinque-foils, violets blue \n
And white, and iris richly gleaming through \n
The grasses of the meadow, and a blaze \n
Of butter-cups and daisies in the field, \n
Filling the air with praise, \n
As if a silver chime of bells had pealed! \n
The frozen songs within the breast \n
Of silent birds that hid in leafless woods, \n
Melt into rippling floods \n
Of gladness unrepressed. \n
Now oriole and blue-bird, thrush and lark, \n
Warbler and wren and vireo, \n
Confuse their music; for the living spark \n
Of Love has touched the fuel of desire, \n
And every heart leaps up in singing fire. \n
It seems as if the land \n
Were breathing deep beneath the sun's caress, \n
Trembling with tenderness, \n
While all the woods expand, \n
In shimmering clouds of rose and gold and green, \n
To veil the joys too sacred to be seen. \n
III \n
Come, put your hand in mine, \n
True love, long sought and found at last, \n
And lead me deep into the Spring divine \n
That makes amends for all the wintry past. \n
For all the flowers and songs I feared to miss \n
Arrive with you; \n
And in the lingering pressure of your kiss \n
My dreams come true; \n
And in the promise of your generous eyes \n
I read the mystic sign \n
Of joy more perfect made \n
Because so long delayed, \n
And bliss enhanced by rapture of surprise. \n
Ah, think not early love alone is strong; \n
He loveth best whose heart has learned to wait: \n
Dear messenger of Spring that tarried long, \n
You're doubly dear because you come so late. \n<|endoftext|>
spring \n
I heard a thousand blended notes \n
While in a grove I sat reclined, \n
In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts \n
Bring sad thoughts to the mind. \n
To her fair works did Nature link \n
The human soul that through me ran; \n
And much it grieved my heart to think \n
What Man has made of Man. \n
Through primrose tufts, in that sweet bower, \n
The periwinkle trailed its wreaths; \n
And 'tis my faith that every flower \n
Enjoys the air it breathes. \n
The birds around me hopped and played, \n
Their thoughts I cannot measure - \n
But the least motion which they made \n
It seemed a thrill of pleasure. \n
The budding twigs spread out their fan \n
To catch the breezy air; \n
And I must think, do all I can, \n
That there was pleasure there. \n
If this belief from heaven be sent, \n
If such be Nature's holy plan, \n
Have I not reason to lament \n
What Man has made of Man? \n<|endoftext|>

An iron hand has stilled the throats \n

The blosmy apple boughs are yearning \n
For their wild choristers' returning, \n
But no swift wings flash through the tree. \n

Burst the frail web about you clinging \n

Till with strange tears his eyes are wet. \n

Unhymned by you, what is the dawn? \n
Nay, since ye loved ye cannot die. \n
Above the stars is set your nest. \n
Through Heaven's fields ye sing and fly \n
And in the trees of Heaven rest. \n

Not present on the year \n

When March is scarcely here \n
A color stands abroad \n
On solitary hills \n
That science cannot overtake, \n
But human naturefeels. \n
It waits upon the lawn; \n
It shows the furthest tree \n
Upon the furthest slope we know; \n
It almost speaks to me. \n
Then, as horizons step, \n
Or noons report away, \n
Without the formula of sound, \n

spring \n
The country ever has a lagging Spring, \n
Waiting for May to call its violets forth, \n
And June its roses--showers and sunshine bring, \n
Slowly, the deepening verdure o'er the earth; \n
To put their foliage out, the woods are slack, \n
And one by one the singing-birds come back. \n
Within the city's bounds the time of flowers \n
Comes earlier. Let a mild and sunny day, \n
Such as full often, for a few bright hours, \n
Breathes through the sky of March the airs of May, \n
Shine on our roofs and chase the wintry gloom-- \n
And lo! our borders glow with sudden bloom. \n
For the wide sidewalks of Broadway are then \n
Gorgeous as are a rivulet's banks in June, \n
That overhung with blossoms, through its glen, \n
Slides soft away beneath the sunny noon, \n
And they who search the untrodden wood for flowers \n
Meet in its depths no lovelier ones than ours. \n
For here are eyes that shame the violet, \n
Or the dark drop that on the pansy lies, \n
And foreheads, white, as when in clusters set, \n
The anemonies by forest fountains rise; \n
And the spring-beauty boasts no tenderer streak \n
Than the soft red on many a youthful cheek. \n
And thick about those lovely temples lie \n
Locks that the lucky Vignardonne has curled, \n
Thrice happy man! whose trade it is to buy, \n
And bake, and braid those love-knots of the world; \n
Who curls of every glossy colour keepest, \n
And sellest, it is said, the blackest cheapest. \n
And well thou may'st--for Italy's brown maids \n
Send the dark locks with which their brows are dressed, \n
And Gascon lasses, from their jetty braids, \n
Crop half, to buy a riband for the rest; \n
But the fresh Norman girls their tresses spare, \n
And the Dutch damsel keeps her flaxen hair. \n
Then, henceforth, let no maid nor matron grieve, \n
To see her locks of an unlovely hue, \n
Frouzy or thin, for liberal art shall give \n
Such piles of curls as nature never knew. \n
Eve, with her veil of tresses, at the sight \n
Had blushed, outdone, and owned herself a fright. \n
Soft voices and light laughter wake the street, \n
Like notes of woodbirds, and where'er the eye \n
Threads the long way, plumes wave, and twinkling feet \n
Fall light, as hastes that crowd of beauty by. \n
The ostrich, hurrying o'er the desert space, \n
Scarce bore those tossing plumes with fleeter pace. \n
No swimming Juno gait, of languor born, \n
Is theirs, but a light step of freest grace, \n
Light as Camilla's o'er the unbent corn, \n
A step that speaks the spirit of the place, \n
Since Quiet, meek old dame, was driven away \n
To Sing Sing and the shores of Tappan bay. \n
Ye that dash by in chariots! who will care \n
For steeds or footmen now? ye cannot show \n
Fair face, and dazzling dress, and graceful air, \n
And last edition of the shape! Ah no, \n

One asketh: \n
"Tell me, Myrson, tell me true: \n
What's the season pleaseth you? \n
Is it summer suits you best, \n
When from harvest toil we rest? \n
Is it autumn with its glory \n
Of all surfeited desires? \n
Is it winter, when with story \n
And with song we hug our fires? \n
Or is spring most fair to you-- \n
Come, good Myrson, tell me true!" \n
Another answereth: \n
"What the gods in wisdom send \n
We should question not, my friend; \n
Yet, since you entreat of me, \n
I will answer reverently: \n
Me the summertime displeases, \n
For its sun is scorching hot; \n
Autumn brings such dire diseases \n
That perforce I like it not; \n
As for biting winter, oh! \n
How I hate its ice and snow! \n
"But, thrice welcome, kindly spring, \n
With the myriad gifts you bring! \n
Not too hot nor yet too cold, \n
Graciously your charms unfold-- \n
Oh, your days are like the dreaming \n
Of those nights which love beseems, \n

Earth smiles up to heaven again!" \n<|endoftext|>
spring \n
Sometimes we remember kisses, \n
Remember the dear heart-leap when they came: \n
Not always, but sometimes we remember \n
The kindness, the dumbness, the good flame \n
Of laughter and farewell. \n
Beside the road \n
Afar from those who said "Good-by" I write, \n
Far from my city task, my lawful load. \n
Sun in my face, wind beside my shoulder, \n
Streaming clouds, banners of new-born night \n
Enchant me now. The splendors growing bolder \n
Make bold my soul for some new wise delight. \n
I write the day's event, and quench my drouth, \n
Pausing beside the spring with happy mind. \n
And now I feel those kisses on my mouth, \n
Hers most of all, one little friend most kind. \n<|endoftext|>
spring \n
In spring and summer winds may blow, \n
And rains fall after, hard and fast; \n
The tender leaves, if beaten low, \n
Shine but the more for shower and blast \n
But when their fated hour arrives, \n
When reapers long have left the field, \n
When maidens rifle turn'd-up hives, \n
And their last juice fresh apples yield, \n
A leaf perhaps may still remain \n
Upon some solitary tree, \n
Spite of the wind and of the rain . . . \n
A thing you heed not if you see. \n
At last it falls. Who cares? Not one: \n
And yet no power on earth can ever \n
Replace the fallen leaf upon \n
Its spray, so easy to dissever. \n
If such be love, I dare not say. \n
Friendship is such, too well I know: \n
I have enjoyed my summer day; \n
'Tis past; my leaf now lies below. \n<|endoftext|>

At last the air fragrant, the bird's bubbling whistle \n
Succinct in the unknown unsettled trees: \n
O little Charles, beside the Georgian colleges \n
And milltown New England; at last the wind soft, \n
The sky unmoving, and the dead look \n
Of factory windows separate, at last, \n
From windows gray and wet: \n
for now the sunlight \n
Thrashes its wet shellac on brickwalk and gutter, \n
White splinters streak midmorning and doorstep, \n
Winter passes as the lighted streetcar \n
Moves at midnight, one scene of the past, \n
Droll and unreal, stiff, stilted and hooded. \n<|endoftext|>
spring \n
To what purpose, April, do you return again? \n
Beauty is not enough. \n
You can no longer quiet me with the redness \n
Of little leaves opening stickily. \n
I know what I know. \n
The sun is hot on my neck as I observe \n
The spikes of the crocus. \n
The smell of the earth is good. \n
It is apparent that there is no death. \n
But what does that signify? \n
Not only under ground are the brains of men \n
Eaten by maggots. \n
Life in itself \n
Is nothing, \n
An empty cup, a flight of uncarpeted stairs. \n
It is not enough that yearly, down this hill, \n
April \n
Comes like an idiot, babbling and strewing flowers. \n<|endoftext|>

dance \n
THE warder looks down at the mid hour of night, \n
On the tombs that lie scatter'd below: \n
The moon fills the place with her silvery light, \n
And the churchyard like day seems to glow. \n
When see! first one grave, then another opes wide, \n
And women and men stepping forth are descried, \n
In cerements snow-white and trailing. \n
In haste for the sport soon their ankles they twitch, \n
And whirl round in dances so gay; \n
The young and the old, and the poor, and the rich, \n
But the cerements stand in their way; \n
And as modesty cannot avail them aught here, \n
They shake themselves all, and the shrouds soon appear \n
Scatter'd over the tombs in confusion. \n
Now waggles the leg, and now wriggles the thigh, \n
As the troop with strange gestures advance, \n
And a rattle and clatter anon rises high, \n
As of one beating time to the dance. \n
The sight to the warder seems wondrously queer, \n
When the villainous Tempter speaks thus in his ear: \n
"Seize one of the shrouds that lie yonder!" \n
Quick as thought it was done! and for safety he fled \n
Behind the church-door with all speed; \n
The moon still continues her clear light to shed \n
On the dance that they fearfully lead. \n
But the dancers at length disappear one by one, \n
And their shrouds, ere they vanish, they carefully don, \n
And under the turf all is quiet. \n
But one of them stumbles and shuffles there still, \n
And gropes at the graves in despair; \n
Yet 'tis by no comrade he's treated so ill \n
The shroud he soon scents in the air. \n
So he rattles the door--for the warder 'tis well \n
That 'tis bless'd, and so able the foe to repel, \n
All cover'd with crosses in metal. \n
The shroud he must have, and no rest will allow, \n
There remains for reflection no time; \n
On the ornaments Gothic the wight seizes now, \n
And from point on to point hastes to climb. \n
Alas for the warder! his doom is decreed! \n
Like a long-legged spider, with ne'er-changing speed, \n
Advances the dreaded pursuer. \n
The warder he quakes, and the warder turns pale, \n
The shroud to restore fain had sought; \n
When the end,--now can nothing to save him avail,-- \n
In a tooth formed of iron is caught. \n
With vanishing lustre the moon's race is run, \n
When the bell thunders loudly a powerful One, \n
And the skeleton fails, crush'd to atoms. \n<|endoftext|>
dance \n
Men with picked voices chant the names \n
of cities in a huge gallery: promises \n
that pull through descending stairways \n
to a deep rumbling. \n
The rubbing feet \n
of those coming to be carried quicken a \n
grey pavement into soft light that rocks \n
to and fro, under the domed ceiling, \n
across and across from pale \n
earthcolored walls of bare limestone. \n
Covertly the hands of a great clock \n
go round and round! Were they to \n
move quickly and at once the whole \n
secret would be out and the shuffling \n
of all ants be done forever. \n
A leaning pyramid of sunlight, narrowing \n
out at a high window, moves by the clock: \n
disaccordant hands straining out from \n
a center: inevitable postures infinitely \n
repeated-- \n
two--twofour--twoeight! \n
Porters in red hats run on narrow platforms. \n
This way ma'am! \n
--important not to take \n
the wrong train! \n
Lights from the concrete \n
ceiling hang crooked but-- \n
Poised horizontal \n
on glittering parallels the dingy cylinders \n
packed with a warm glow--inviting entry-- \n
pull against the hour. But brakes can \n
hold a fixed posture till-- \n
The whistle! \n
Not twoeight. Not twofour. Two! \n
Gliding windows. Colored cooks sweating \n
in a small kitchen. Taillights-- \n
In time: twofour! \n
In time: twoeight! \n
--rivers are tunneled: trestles \n
cross oozy swampland: wheels repeating \n
the same gesture remain relatively \n
stationary: rails forever parallel \n
return on themselves infinitely. \n
The dance is sure. \n<|endoftext|>

Long ago a prophet appeared, \n
A Piute Medicine Chief known as Wovoka. \n
He spoke to the Lakota people and others, \n
Of how to banish the white man. \n
They knew not they faced such great numbers. \n
This Messiah taught the Ghost Dance, \n
And promised come next spring, \n
New soil would smother all white men, \n
Sweet grass would cover the land, \n
Wild horses & buffalo would return, \n
All who danced the Ghost Dance, \n
Would be taken up into the air, \n
Suspended while new earth was laid down. \n
Kicking Bear assured Sitting Bull that, \n
If their people wore Ghost Dance shirts, \n
White mans bullets could not strike them so, \n
They painted their shirts with sacred symbols. \n
Indian agents grew nervous, moved quickly, \n
Telegraphing Washington for more troops. \n
Soldiers surrounded Sitting Bulls camp, \n
A fight ensued and many were killed. \n
Ghost Dance was thwarted, \n
before magic could fulfill... \n
'The Second Coming” prophecy belonged to the white man, \n
For they worshiped 'A Most Jealous god” \n<|endoftext|>

I watched with fascination \n
One of the tiniest of creations \n
Communicate to each other \n
To their sisters and their brothers \n
It was funny at first glance \n
As it seemed to be a dance \n
They weren't using hands like us \n
It was a different kind of trust \n
They were using their antennas \n
To show what was on their new agenda \n
They would walk up to each other \n
Face to face but not to smother \n
Then their antennas start to fly \n
As they tickle in the sky \n
Passing along the information \n
On from station to new station \n
The words they passed along \n
Must have been so very strong \n
Because in their antenna dance \n
The ants seemed to be in such a trance \n
Even all the younger \n
seemed to have a little hunger \n
Every word was understood \n
To follow if they could \n
'Please, all step in line \n
and you'll find a place to dine! ' \n

out of reach of finger tips; \n
danced on daddy’s feet. \n
I’ve lost my breath, \n
drowning and it hurts so. \n
Daddy, dance me \n
through this darkness into luminescence. \n
You once saved me \n
from that beautiful obsidian man, \n
who cut me to the bone; \n
now save me from myself. \n
Crash through my palisade again \n
and rescue me daddy, \n
waltz me to freedom. \n<|endoftext|>
dance \n
To live life as it is unfolding \n
under my nose \n
Right now \n
To accept myself as I really am \n
in the core of my being \n
Right now \n
To let go of the need to change the way I am \n
and love myself warts and all \n
Right now \n
To move to the rhythms of my true self \n
and allow myself to feel the tenderness within me \n
Right now \n
Life - I offer you my hand \n
Let's dance... \n
This poem is inspired by The Dance by Oriah Mountain Dreamer. \n<|endoftext|>
dance \n
As in the desert, \n
A sand blows, \n
It's eastward wings carrying it's wonderous jewels \n
A lady, dancing no less, her face that of a thousand queens, \n
Drawing all those about into her deep cavern of mystery, \n
Her fiery presence both a blessing and a curse, \n
For there before you now stands the dancer of life. \n
No lines shall be cut, No rules shall be decided \n
A wind shall shape the gentle curves, \n
And water shall give it's shine \n
As the fire within glows brightly, herself a lady of time \n
Swords flash in the setting sun, \n
And veils twirl around her, \n
A commotion caused over her openess, her trueness \n
A woman, a woman, not to be free \n
Not to be opened, not to be seen \n
No, No, this is not how to be! \n
She shall not hidden, nor given as a bride \n
But open her soul, and hold out her pride \n
There is a dance, a dance to be free \n
I speak of this dance, \n
Because between you and me, \n
It's the dance of the ancients, and the dance of the new \n
Of the old and the young, \n
It's the dance of many a tongue, \n
For this is my dance, my chance to be free \n
And open and happy, and truely be me \n<|endoftext|>

I am sitting in the back of the bus \n
Observing the children play \n
With the weather just gorgeous \n
On a very lovely day \n
A mother of two \n
Tries to discipline her son \n
He just would not listen \n
He just wanted to have fun \n
As the mother told him to sit down \n
He raised his foot at her \n
I couldn't believe what I saw \n

Has this boy lost his mind \n

Wonderful stars are there in our sky \n

i'm afraid of making new friends, thinking they will hurt me, but a little courage is all it takes! \n
i'm scared of finding love, and get hurt inside, but a little courage is all it takes! \n
i'm terribly scared of loosing my friends, because they are all i have, all i need, all i ever wanted, all i ever dreamed of, but in this, i don't need courage, because i know that they will always be beside me! ! ! \n

God has given courage and boldness \n
That must certainly be reflected on face \n
Women of today are by all means capable \n
Handle the situation and come out as successful \n
In any situation charm must be retained \n
Smile on face should never be deserted \n
If that is allowed then wolves may simply not pounce \n
Take away flash and enjoy their yield of an ounce \n
World as such is no safe heaven \n
For a lady and staying as single woman \n
People may try to take advantage \n
Try to inflict injury that may not be worth to mention on page \n
So it is nice to defend self and get prepared \n
So no one comes and simply dared \n
Someone has to take lead and show courage \n
Whole of the community then may show comeback on stage \n
Female today is not helpless animal \n

courage \n
The courage of the shut mouth, in spite of artillery! \n
The line pink and quiet, a worm, basking. \n
There are black disks behind it, the disks of outrage, \n
And the outrage of a sky, the lined brain of it. \n
The disks revolve, they ask to be heard— \n
Loaded, as they are, with accounts of ****ies. \n
****ies, usages, desertions and doubleness, \n
The needle journeying in its groove, \n
Silver beast between two dark canyons, \n
A great surgeon, now a tattooist, \n
Tattooing over and over the same blue grievances, \n
The snakes, the babies, the tits \n
On mermaids and two-legged dreamgirls. \n
The surgeon is quiet, he does not speak. \n
He has seen too much death, his hands are full of it. \n
So the disks of the brain revolve, like the muzzles of cannon. \n
Then there is that antique billhook, the tongue, \n
Indefatigable, purple. Must it be cut out? \n
It has nine tails, it is dangerous. \n
And the noise it flays from the air, once it gets going! \n
No, the tongue, too, has been put by, \n
Hung up in the library with the engravings of Rangoon \n
And the fox heads, the otter heads, the heads of dead rabbits. \n
It is a marvelous object— \n
The things it has pierced in its time. \n
But how about the eyes, the eyes, the eyes? \n
Mirrors can kill and talk, they are terrible rooms \n
In which a torture goes on one can only watch. \n
The face that lived in this mirror is the face of a dead man. \n
Do not worry about the eyes— \n
They may be white and shy, they are no stool pigeons, \n
Their death rays folded like flags \n
Of a country no longer heard of, \n
An obstinate independency \n
Insolvent among the mountains. \n<|endoftext|>

It will take courage to respect someone others don't \n

So what does this mean? \n
Courage is essential in your journey through life. \n<|endoftext|>

courage \n
What does courage mean to me? \n
What does it mean to you? \n
To some, a single attribute, others, quite a few, \n
For courage is a lack of fear, inspired by faith and love, \n
Love of a person, place, or thing, faith in "our Lord" above. \n
In time of stress, the "Lord" provides, the strength to overcome, \n
It's courage! giving special drive! until the goal is won. \n
When danger threatens life or limb, it's courage to the fore, \n
A courage known by many names, as: daring! guts! and more. \n
Whatever name we give this trait, it's valiant! stout! and bold! \n
In action, it is fortitude, a wonder! to behold. \n<|endoftext|>
courage \n
it takes courage to say life goes on \n
without knowing where you might end \n
it takes a lot of courage to achieve what \n
you want to be in life \n
it takes more courage to forgive \n
someone that hurt you \n
it takes more courage to make a tough decision \n
when you know you might end up paying consequences \n
it take more than courage \n
to be responsible and honest \n
it takes more than what you call courage \n
to be a real man! ! \n<|endoftext|>
courage \n
It's hard to translate one's feelings into speech, \n
It takes time to overcome the obstacles we meet. \n
Don't live life scared of what your words will bring, \n
Even if you fail, at least you attempted to do something. \n
In this life I would rather fail everyday, \n
And tell my stories of the one's that got away... \n
Then sit alone with my regrets always haunting me... \n
'I could have been, but I never had the courage to be.' \n<|endoftext|>
courage \n
The least because he trembles to grey fear \n
That man should call courage to conquer fright, \n
Fine if a man at times should frightened be, \n
Not if he should flight from fear’s bleary blight, \n
Howso brave, a man needs courage no mean \n
To face, fight, and conquer what he does fear, \n
And he needs to fear first— courage to win, \n
That dwells yon fear, yet close enough and near. \n
King Odysseus, who this truth knew just fine, \n
Reasoned Achilles to fight the Trojan War: \n
If ye should fear no one, problem ‘tis thine, \n
Do keep fear close to thy courageous shore. \n
Ah, soothing most words these I’ve ever heard: \n
No man courageous is that hath ne’er feared. \n
1. The poem uses the dialogue of the movie, Troy. The words \n
used therein are: ‘You don’t fear anyone, that’s your problem. \n
Sometimes fear is useful’. \n

Very own, \n
Needs courage. \n
Unfortunately, most of us are wanting \n
In that courage. \n
The courage of the heart, \n
The courage of the soul \n
We badly need, \n
And not the courage \n
Of the unruly, \n
Aggressive, \n
Impure, \n
Demanding vital. \n<|endoftext|>
courage \n
There were many who went in huddled procession, \n
They knew not whither; \n
But, at any rate, success or calamity \n
Would attend all in equality. \n
There was one who sought a new road. \n
He went into direful thickets, \n
And ultimately he died thus, alone; \n
But they said he had courage. \n<|endoftext|>
courage \n
What am I to do \n
when even eternally \n
I'm shivering from fright, \n
instead of from the wind? \n
Am I to draw close \n
to flames that shimmer \n
in crackling darkness \n
on a night like this? \n
Or shall I lean into you \n
while dreaming of the \n
summers days of the old- \n
times when I was self assured? \n
With sadness I walk \n
this plank through valleys, \n
though I have not yet expired. \n
I plead...is this my last mile? \n
For I do not wish to exit \n
this lonely passage way, while \n
feeling all I knew was survival. \n
Dear Courage...will you visit again? \n

courage \n
Courage is standing in the middle of a war zone \n
Not knowing if you’ll be making it back home \n
Courage is leaving your loved ones behind \n
Not knowing for sure if you were seeing them for the last time \n
Courage is holding the weapon in your hand in a do or die place \n
Not showing the enemy traces of your fear and despair on your face \n
Courage is able to sleep at night with one eye open and eye closed \n
Not knowing if tomorrow, you’ll be the next one not coming home \n
Courage is reading a letter from a loved one holding back the tears \n
Remaining strong is your mission and survival becomes your darkest fears \n
Courage is seeing soldiers die right in front of you \n
While you are aware that your life is at risk for a mission you were born to do \n
Courage is being a hero in everyone’s eyes \n
Whether or not you come out alive \n
There, you will always and forever remain; a Soldier’s War of Courage… \n<|endoftext|>
courage \n
CARELESSLY over the plain away, \n
Where by the boldest man no path \n
Cut before thee thou canst discern, \n
Make for thyself a path! \n
Silence, loved one, my heart! \n
Cracking, let it not break! \n
Breaking, break not with thee! \n<|endoftext|>
courage \n
Tell me how to overcome this fear \n
And I will listen and memorise every word. \n
Point to me the easy solution \n
But remind me that all great things need courage. \n
I am afraid of rejection, \n
Please say that I might be missing True love \n
And that access to happiness \n
is not given with out a struggle. \n
Convince me to hear the weak voice inside me \n
And not the loud one that is always there, \n
Help me to become a better listener of myself. \n
Protect me from comments that \n
I really don’t need to hear, \n
Teach me not to be influenced \n
By people that are more willing to judge \n
Than understand, \n
Take my hand and lead me to the pathway \n
That deep inside I know I should follow. \n
Blow courage into my face \n
Until I open my eyes.. \n<|endoftext|>

Courage fully \n
How does only smile? \n
When you are troubled for a while \n
You are like any other man \n
No superman but only human' \n
You may keep happiness \n
And show it on face \n
But no one may notice \n
As you have your own voice \n
You may not love \n
And believe \n
In exposing woes \n
As life has many ways \n
It shows how to live \n
What to believe \n
And what to avoid \n
You can only add woes \n
So you have to make human efforts \n
With reports \n

Nor life beyond death: \n
God, if this were faith! \n
Having felt thy wind in my face \n
Spit sorrow and disgrace, \n
Having seen thine evil doom \n
In Golgotha and Khartoum, \n
And the brutes, the work of thine hands, \n
Fill with injustice lands \n
And stain with blood the sea: \n
If still in my veins the glee \n
Of the black night and the sun \n
And the lost battle, run: \n
If, an adept, \n
The iniquitous lists I still accept \n
With joy, and joy to endure and be withstood, \n
And still to battle and perish for a dream of good: \n
God, if that were enough! \n
If to feel, in the ink of the slough, \n
And the sink of the mire, \n
Veins of glory and fire \n
Run through and transpierce and transpire, \n
And a secret purpose of glory in every part, \n
And the answering glory of battle fill my heart; \n
To thrill with the joy of girded men \n
To go on for ever and fail and go on again, \n
And be mauled to the earth and arise, \n
And contend for the shade of a word and a thing \n
not seen with the eyes: \n
With the half of a broken hope for a pillow at night \n
That somehow the right is the right \n
And the smooth shall bloom from the rough: \n

Once for the sceptre of Germany, fought with Bavarian Louis \n
Frederick, of Hapsburg descent, both being called to the throne. \n
But the envious fortune of war delivered the Austrian \n
Into the hands of the foe, who overcame him in fight. \n
With the throne he purchased his freedom, pledging his honor \n
For the victor to draw 'gainst his own people his sword; \n
But what he vowed when in chains, when free he could not accomplish, \n
So, of his own free accord, put on his fetters again. \n
Deeply moved, his foe embraced him,--and from thenceforward \n
As a friend with a friend, pledged they the cup at the feast; \n
Arm-in-arm, the princes on one couch slumbered together. \n
While a still bloodier hate severed the nations apart. \n
'Gainst the army of Frederick Louis now went, and behind him \n
Left the foe he had fought, over Bavaria to watch. \n
"Ay, it is true! 'Tis really true! I have it in writing!" \n

Not to hold it like I hold this pen- \n
Just have faith- \n
Even amidst the treason \n
Even amidst the doubt \n
Even in the face of that glaring question \n
'Does he really exists? ' \n
Have Faith! \n
Have Faith! Thats the only answer \n
The end of every discussion over it \n
Just have faith- \n
It was never proved and established, \n
It will never be proved and established \n

That is why they say- \n
Have faith. \n
Have faith its not a dogma \n
Live it as a way of life not rituals \n
Just have faith- \n
Its a life long struggle to assert it \n
Its an unquenched thirst to believe in it \n
Its an unending search of a bodyless soul \n
Will always remain unsatisfied so- \n
Have faith! \n
Have faith but don't renounce for it \n
Instead endeavor to achieve and- \n
Just have faith- \n
That the endeavors will be successful \n
That they will breed more dreams to chase \n
That achieving is also a faith \n
But does not require conquering \n
Have faith! \n
Have Faith but not to fight atheism \n
That again is another face of faith \n
Just have faith- \n
To believe that the Ideal exists \n
To follow the Ideal, not to preach \n
To emulate the Ideal to the nearest possible \n
That is the purpose of all faiths \n

A blue jay poses on a stake \n
meant to support an apple tree \n
newly planted. A strong wind \n
on this clear cold morning \n
barely ruffles his tail feathers. \n
When he turns his attention \n
toward me, I face his eyes \n
without blinking. A week ago \n
my wife called me to come see \n
this same bird chase a rat \n
into the thick leaves \n
of an orange tree. We came as \n
close as we could and watched \n
the rat dig his way into an orange, \n
claws working meticulously. \n
Then he feasted, face deep \n
into the meal, and afterwards \n
washed himself in juice, paws \n
scrubbing soberly. Surprised \n
by the whiteness of the belly, \n
how open it was and vulnerable, \n
I suggested I fetch my .22. \n
She said, "Do you want to kill him?" \n
I didn't. There are oranges \n
enough for him, the jays, and us, \n
across the fence in the yard \n
next door oranges rotting \n
on the ground. There is power \n
in the name rat, a horror \n
that may be private. When I \n
was a boy and heir to tales \n
of savagery, of sleeping men \n
and kids eaten half away before \n
they could wake, I came to know \n
that horror. I was afraid \n
that left alive the animal \n
would invade my sleep, grown \n
immense now and powerful \n
with the need to eat flesh. \n
I was wrong. Night after night \n
I wake from dreams of a city \n
like no other, the bright city \n
of beauty I thought I'd lost \n
when I lost my faith that one day \n
we would come into our lives. \n
The wind gusts and calms \n
shaking this miniature budding \n
apple tree that in three months \n
has taken to the hard clay \n
of our front yard. In one hop \n
the jay turns his back on me, \n
dips as though about to drink \n
the air itself, and flies. \n<|endoftext|>

My religion taught me \n
About God who is a loving father \n

Few even claim I am a dreamer \n
For someone beyond truth and reality \n
Creation of reason for beauty \n
But what can I say \n

Even if formless like nothingness \n

Too near yet so far I know it \n

Under the snow in the dark and the cold, \n
A pale little sprout was humming; \n
Sweetly it sang, ‘neath the frozen mold, \n
Of the beautiful days that were coming. \n
“How foolish your songs, ” said a lump of clay, \n
“What is there, I ask, to prove them? \n
Just look at the walls between you and the day, \n
Now, have you the strength to move them? ” \n
But under the ice and under the snow \n
The pale little sprout kept singing, \n
“I cannot tell how, but I know, I know, \n
I know what the days are bringing.” \n
“Birds, and blossoms, and buzzing bees, \n
Blue, blue skies above me, \n
Bloom on the meadows and buds on the trees, \n
And the great glad sun to love me.” \n
A pebble spoke next: “You are quite absurd.” \n
It said, “with your song’s insistence; \n
For I never saw a tree or a bird, \n
So of course there are none in existence.” \n
“But I know, I know, ” the tendril cried, \n
In beautiful sweet unreason; \n
Till lo! from its prison, glorified, \n
It burst in the glad spring season. \n<|endoftext|>

S \n
So you say that God is real, my friend, \n
Then why is there war and hate? \n
And what about babies that die, \n
And what about their fate? \n
Are we cursed because we don't believe, \n
Are we cursed because we fell? \n
There may not be a God in Heaven, \n
But I'm sure we're living in Hell. \n
J \n
The unknown ways of our powerful God? \n
Well now, \n
How shall I explain? \n
For Man is only using about \n
one tenth of his brain \n
Bad things don’t happen because of God \n
That’s why we have free will \n
We do the bad things to ourselves \n
And I guess we always will \n
S \n
So convince me then that God is love \n
Convince me of it, please \n
Show me that he cares for all, \n
And that he cares for me. \n
Convince me that it’s not a lie, \n
Convince me that it’s real, \n
Convince me that his name is Lord, \n
Is this the way you feel? \n
J \n
It is not for me to convince you \n
For I am only man \n
But I’ll help you know the spirit of God \n
In a way you will understand \n
For when you open up your heart \n
And you open up your mind \n
You’ll feel his very presence and \n
Know that you’ve been blind \n
S \n
Yes, well then, that all sounds fine, \n
I’ll try, but how to start? \n
I could offer up a prayer to him, \n
But the horse is before the cart, \n
I think that he should call me first, \n
And loud, so I can hear, \n
But none of those pesky “thou shalt do’s” \n
Or how “that I should fear.” \n
J \n
God is speaking to you everyday \n
You have just refused to hear \n
Hark now at the sounds of silence \n
You will know that God is near \n
For in the silence are many angels \n
That crowd that empty space \n
It’s full of voices of loved ones past \n
Now living in God’s grace \n
S \n
Then I’ll walk out to the Quarry Lake \n
And I’ll sit and I will listen, \n
I’ll be most pious and I will wait, \n
For silence, as the waters glisten. \n
Then a voice “Sit still my child, \n
“I love you, and I will lead” \n
It was the Lord, I heard so plain, \n
It was a loving plea. \n
J \n
So you have discovered how easily \n
God can show himself to man \n
He sends the angels just for us \n
As part of his greater plan \n
To teach us how to really see \n
And open up our eyes \n
For this world is just an Angel school \n
I hope you realize. \n
S \n
Well, I’ll tell you this, I understand \n
You convinced me of his love \n
And I can see the angels too, \n
And the guidance from above. \n
I see it clear, he loves me too, \n
And will never let me fall, \n
And thanks my friend, you made me hear, \n
The silence of God’s call. \n

In the same way that the mindless diamond keeps \n
one spark of the planet's early fires \n
trapped forever in its net of ice, \n
it's not love's later heat that poetry holds, \n
but the atom of the love that drew it forth \n
from the silence: so if the bright coal of his love \n
begins to smoulder, the poet hears his voice \n
suddenly forced, like a bar-room singer's -- boastful \n
with his own huge feeling, or drowned by violins; \n
but if it yields a steadier light, he knows \n
the pure verse, when it finally comes, will sound \n
like a mountain spring, anonymous and serene. \n
Beneath the blue oblivious sky, the water \n
sings of nothing, not your name, not mine. \n<|endoftext|>
poetry \n
The finite contemplating the infinite \n
The stardust male and female still flush with light \n
From exploding stars, seeding new possibilities, our true progenitors. \n
So that even God Himself must take note of our passing (in its season) , \n
Such elemental purity of spirit, such shining stock do we hail from. \n
Thinkers cannot grasp the number of galaxies the universe holds \n
Let alone name them or divine their future, human brains too slow, \n
More galaxies than all the grains of sand from every beach on the planet. \n
Where once this metaphor was applied loosely to stars alone, \n
Now galaxies are what might be counted, counting stars unimaginable. \n
Oh we are clever and have our tricks to make us look wise, \n
Like when we prove that one kind of infinity is bigger than another, \n
But all infinities are truly beyond our ken, mere children who count \n
‘One, two, three, many, ' and think we have accomplished something. \n
In our childish wonder we are only newly aware of galactic reach, \n
Theoretically sure now that our universe does have a furthest edge, \n
But totally unaware of its dimensions or of its actual shape. \n
New maps of different galaxy locations in space surprise us too \n
As the distribution of galaxies follows an unimagined ribbon like pattern. \n
Galaxies are NOT evenly distributed throughout the mapped universe \n
But shoot off in flares like star shells on the 4th of July! \n
We are dreamers who woke one day to discover that once fixed stars \n
Are now time machines to those with eyes to see, revealing our past, \n
And to those with ears to hear comes the certain knowledge of the Big Bang. \n
Now, vision enhanced by scientific revelation, we can share with God, \n
‘Seek and you shall find, ' being the foundational faith of Science, \n
The wonders of this creation, several billion years past, naked before us, \n
As if we were there, reveling in its wonders (though now a cosmic rerun) , \n
Sharing a nice glass of Merlot with God in front of His Big Screen, \n
(The miracle of buttered popcorn always tender, hot, and fresh! Yum!) , \n
Looking back to times when even laws of physics had not matured yet, \n
Laws, which, perhaps, like human beings, still evolve, biding their time. \n
But tantalizingly fresh is the QUESTION of other universes \n
Which now skips across the surface of human thought horizon like a stone \n
Every bounce suggesting another universe's possibility, \n
And every impact seemingly perfectly elastic, with no loss of energy, \n
Leaving another new universe in its wake, \n
Rippling outward like concentric waves from a whale's breach, \n
On a salt sea/air interface that reflects our astonishment like a mirror! \n
God's kind of Poetry, a window into infinity, \n
A scaled down version of Divinity, almost human in fact, \n
The footprints of God's Son along a sea curving with the earth's surface, \n
Distant realities always just out of sight, but there still. \n
Calling us into service, calling us too to be Fishers of human souls, \n
To love to heights and depths beyond our understanding, \n
And in so doing, to in fact become God's Children, \n
Trusting Love, knowing Love, feeling Love, giving Love… \n
Millions of Prophets, Buddhas, Saints, Poets, all siblings of the Christ, \n
A living poem, universally true, surfeit of God's imagination, \n
Novice initiates of a Grace that fills every nook and cranny, \n
Penetrates all flesh, all bone, and saturates soul like a sponge. \n<|endoftext|>
poetry \n

striking paper filled with imprints \n
ink staining along this cracked soul \n
poetry \n
In poetry's fond verse we save \n
All matters of the heart, \n
Our thoughts that may be sweet or grave, \n
With which we'd hate to part. \n
Our fears of what may come to pass, \n
Our sadness at what has, \n
The desperate state of pain's impasse, \n
A human Alcatraz. \n
The lessons that pain teaches us, \n
Road signs, in fact to joy, \n
Our God's reforming animus, \n
Love's armor for schoolboy. \n
Remembering that pain serves man, \n
Is always hard to do, \n
Puts limits on outrageous plan, \n
Helps vanity subdue. \n
Our owning of the father God, \n
The highest we can reach, \n
Releasing our own dreams slipshod \n
For what He has to teach. \n<|endoftext|>

A friend once asked why I write poetry. \n
Judging by the pinched look on her face, \n

They are uncomfortable where they are, \n

poetry \n
What is poetry? \n
Poetry is many things \n
But there are far more things that poetry is not \n
Poetry is not a style of writing \n
Poetry is not a rhyme or a limerick \n
Poetry is not something you can read \n
Poetry isn't just seen or heard, but seen, heard, and felt \n
What is poetry, then? \n
I can't tell you that, no one can \n
But you can only know \n
And even then you can't tell anyone what poetry is \n
Because poetry isn't words \n
Poetry is a feeling you get in your chest \n
Poetry is a chill that runs through your body \n
Poetry is a knife that slices your soul \n
Poetry is experienced from within \n
If something rhymes and it makes sense \n
It may be a poem \n
But it isn't poetry \n
Can you hear your soul calling out to you? \n
That is poetry \n
Can you feel the tightness in your chest, the squeezing of your heart? \n
That is poetry \n
A boy and girl at the edge a cliff, dangerously close, leaning over the edge \n
Their arms outstretched, they soar \n
They can fly anywhere without ever leaving their perch \n
The sound of a flute and swirling colors \n
Reds, blues, greens, white and black \n
Harmony, a sound that goes straight through you \n
The midnight sky with stars that speak \n
What they whisper in your ear is faint \n
But even if you can't hear it, if you can feel it, it is poetry \n
A solitary wolf bounding through a forest \n
So graceful, paws that never touch the ground \n
Eyes shining brighter than the sun \n
The movements of the human body \n
Muscles within neck, arms, legs \n
The body is living poetry \n
Flex your fingers \n
How do they move? \n
Every part of you, poetry in itself \n
The wind blowing through an open window \n
Moist breeze that dampens your face, your bed \n
The moonlight shining through \n
Is poetry \n
But this is hardly poetry, what you read now \n
Because poetry isn't words \n
Poetry isn't what you see or hear \n
It is what you feel \n
Poetry is what you believe \n
What you are \n<|endoftext|>
poetry \n
As one of the wrinkly-crumblies \n
-W.A.S.P. without the sting - \n
it puzzles me: in poetry, \n
does one good **** really deserve another? \n
fifty years ago - fifty, for ****'s sake - \n
when I was an army cadet \n
some squaddies used it every other word \n
-and since we were in Signals, \n
it ****ing delayed ****ing battle-orders ****ing long enough \n
to ****ing mow down a ****ing platoon... \n
and longer in ****ing Morse... - - -... \n
and as for ****ing semaphore...makes your ****ing arms flag... \n
my liberal friends \n
who never admit to shock \n
say 'it shows a.... lack of imagination'; \n
now that's ****ing serious in ****ing poets. \n
outside the ****ing English-spitting world \n
it must seem ****ing strange \n
that the most-loved ****ing bodily action \n
is used as a ****ing swear-word - \n
what have you ****ers got against ****ing? \n
or is it a term of ****ing praise maybe? \n
and why still a shock-word \n
amongst you young lot \n
who get a lot more ****ing ****ing than we ever did? Dammit. \n
Philologically, \n
is it still heard \n
as ****ing onomatopoeic? \n
which makes it pretty near to ****ing S&M I'd say? \n
could you****ers (whom I love for your interest in poetry \n
I have to say) \n
give me, as a reasonable ****er, \n
a ****ing explanation? \n
it would be ****ing useful \n
poetically \n
And who the **** is this \n
'American realist' poet Charles F***offski \n
whom you admire so much, anyway? \n<|endoftext|>

I am tired but I like to continue. \n
My posture is feeble \n

I must thank the poemhunter website and all my fellowship \n
who gave a space to this tiny animal to walk along the road \n

poetry \n
The Farmer's Goose, who in the Stubble, \n
Has fed without Restraint, or Trouble; \n
Grown fat with Corn and Sitting still, \n
Can scarce get o'er the Barn-Door Sill: \n
And hardly waddles forth, to cool \n
Her Belly in the neighb'ring Pool: \n
Nor loudly cackles at the Door; \n
For Cackling shews the Goose is poor. \n
But when she must be turn'd to graze, \n
And round the barren Common strays, \n
Hard Exercise, and harder Fare \n
Soon make my Dame grow lank and spare: \n
Her Body light, she tries her Wings, \n
And scorns the Ground, and upward springs, \n
While all the Parish, as she flies, \n
Hear Sounds harmonious from the Skies. \n
Such is the Poet, fresh in Pay, \n
(The third Night's Profits of his Play;) \n
His Morning-Draughts 'till Noon can swill, \n
Among his Brethren of the Quill: \n
With good Roast Beef his Belly full, \n
Grown lazy, foggy, fat, and dull: \n
Deep sunk in Plenty, and Delight, \n
What Poet e'er could take his Flight? \n
Or stuff'd with Phlegm up to the Throat, \n
What Poet e'er could sing a Note? \n
Nor Pegasus could bear the Load, \n
Along the high celestial Road; \n
The Steed, oppress'd, would break his Girth, \n
To raise the Lumber from the Earth. \n
But, view him in another Scene, \n
When all his Drink is Hippocrene, \n
His Money spent, his Patrons fail, \n
His Credit out for Cheese and Ale; \n
His Two-Year's Coat so smooth and bare, \n
Through ev'ry Thread it lets in Air; \n
With hungry Meals his Body pin'd, \n
His Guts and Belly full of Wind; \n
And, like a Jockey for a Race, \n
His Flesh brought down to Flying-Case: \n
Now his exalted Spirit loaths \n
Incumbrances of Food and Cloaths; \n
And up he rises like a Vapour, \n
Supported high on Wings of Paper; \n
He singing flies, and flying sings, \n
While from below all Grub-street rings. \n<|endoftext|>
poetry \n
I once wrote some poetry - the best, \n
the finest POETRY \n
My POETRY came with a capital \n
"P". \n
My POETRY was distinguished \n
POETRY, proper, complete line of \n
Verse POETRY - honorable, \n
prehistoric, geographical POETRY \n
Divine, instinctive, even religious \n
POETRY - \n
I sent it to the magazines \n
The very good magazines \n
The very best magazines - \n
They returned it to me every time! \n
I once wrote some inferior POETRY \n
Low in style, irregular in measure \n
POETRY \n
Undignified, trivial, absurd POETRY \n
inadequate, mischievous, comic \n
POETRY \n
Some stuff like this - A CRIME - \n
I sent it to the magazines \n
The very good magazines \n
The very best magazines \n
They kept it every time! \n
Now, I ask of you - my question is \n
fair and brief - I ask \n
Of you - your ear I pray and beg you \n
give - \n
Shall I write intuitive, \n
comprehensive, reasoning \n
POETRY \n
Specific, Godlike, Capitol \n
committed POETRY \n
The sort I think will live? \n
Or shall I write inferior, very bad \n
POETRY - the kind that soon is \n
Dead - and send it to the magazines, \n
the very good, the best magazines \n
THAT I MAY LIVE INSTEAD!!! \n<|endoftext|>
poetry \n
Ladies and Gentlemen, \n
this is my first poetry reading \n
and I’m very nervous \n
and nearly cancelled tonight \n
but I spoke about this to \n
a friend who’s a therapist \n
and he said, \n
this is what you do, \n
you imagine the audience \n
in front of you \n
all in their underwear \n
(as you probably are; but \n
without the outer layer) \n
with the men \n
wearing the most idiotic \n
flowered Hawaiian \n
two sizes too large \n
boxer shorts \n
and the ladies \n
in the frumpiest \n
underwear \n
you can imagine \n
apparently it works \n
so if I look at you, ladies and gentlemen, \n
somewhat strangely \n
from time to time \n
or giggle uncontrollably \n
or my eyes rest on you personally \n
as if we’re sharing some huge \n
x-ray joke, \n
please forgive me \n
and understand \n
that’s it for your benefit \n
as well as mine \n
and that you will have put your outerwear \n
back on \n
in the interval \n
before the next poem \n
I hope this is OK with you \n
and nobody’s too embarrassed \n
in fact you could do the same trick \n
with me if it’s \n
any help \n
and now \n
I think I’ve said enough as \n
I’m OK now \n
how about you? \n
(For maximum effect, pause noticeably at the end of each line) \n
(with thanks to Ernestine for the idea) \n<|endoftext|>
poetry \n
I have no silver-saddled horse to ride, \n
no inheritance to live on, \n
neither riches no real-estate -- \n
a pot of honey is all I own. \n
A pot of honey \n
red as fire! \n
My honey is my everything. \n
I guard \n
my riches and my real-estate \n
-- my honey pot, I mean -- \n
from pests of every species, \n
Brother, just wait... \n
As long as I've got \n
honey in my pot, \n
bees will come to it \n
from Timbuktu... \n

Poetry! ! Poetry! ! Poetry! ! \n
Why are we addicted to Poetry? \n
We Poets who write, \n
All day or all night, \n
That Poetry! ! Poetry! ! Poetry! ! \n
There’s scarce a moment in time, \n
That thoughts don’t find words in rhyme, \n
To put into verse, \n
Whether better or worse, \n
In that Poetry! ! Poetry! ! Poetry! ! \n
Why do we write all these Verses? \n
We must have better things to do, \n
But whatever we try, \n
And I don’t know why, \n
We write Poem upon Poem for you. \n
It’s funny how my style has changed, \n
It’s a Limerick today I’ve composed, \n
It wasn’t meant to be, \n
But it is ~ you can see, \n
Just Poetry! ! Poetry! ! Poetry! ! \n

poetry \n
Read poetry understand poetry, \n
Poetry is the creator \n
Poetry is one who maintains \n
Everything and all. \n
Poetry is the supreme truth, \n
Poetry, all it is you. \n
Poetry is everything \n
And everybody and \n
Poetry is everywhere. \n
So pious - poetry \n
Full of nectar - poetry \n
Poetry is love and life. \n<|endoftext|>
poetry \n
Religions are poems. They concert \n
our daylight and dreaming mind, our \n
emotions, instinct, breath and native gesture \n
into the only whole thinking: poetry. \n
Nothing's said till it's dreamed out in words \n
and nothing's true that figures in words only. \n
A poem, compared with an arrayed religion, \n
may be like a soldier's one short marriage night \n
to die and live by. But that is a small religion. \n
Full religion is the large poem in loving repetition; \n
like any poem, it must be inexhaustible and complete \n
with turns where we ask Now why did the poet do that? \n
You can't pray a lie, said Huckleberry Finn; \n
you can't poe one either. It is the same mirror: \n
mobile, glancing, we call it poetry, \n
fixed centrally, we call it a religion, \n
and God is the poetry caught in any religion, \n
caught, not imprisoned. Caught as in a mirror \n
that he attracted, being in the world as poetry \n
is in the poem, a law against its closure. \n
There'll always be religion around while there is poetry \n
or a lack of it. Both are given, and intermittent, \n
as the action of those birds - crested pigeon, rosella parrot - \n
who fly with wings shut, then beating, and again shut. \n<|endoftext|>
poetry \n
There is a quiet spirit in these woods, \n
That dwells where'er the gentle south-wind blows; \n
Where, underneath the white-thorn, in the glade, \n
The wild flowers bloom, or, kissing the soft air, \n
The leaves above their sunny palms outspread. \n
With what a tender and impassioned voice \n
It fills the nice and delicate ear of thought, \n
When the fast ushering star of morning comes \n
O'er-riding the gray hills with golden scarf; \n
Or when the cowled and dusky-sandaled Eve, \n
In mourning weeds, from out the western gate, \n
Departs with silent pace! That spirit moves \n
In the green valley, where the silver brook, \n
From its full laver, pours the white cascade; \n
And, babbling low amid the tangled woods, \n
Slips down through moss-grown stones with endless laughter. \n
And frequent, on the everlasting hills, \n
Its feet go forth, when it doth wrap itself \n
In all the dark embroidery of the storm, \n
And shouts the stern, strong wind. And here, amid \n
The silent majesty of these deep woods, \n
lts presence shall uplift thy thoughts from earth, \n
As to the sunshine and the pure, bright air \n
Their tops the green trees lift. Hence gifted bards \n
Have ever loved the calm and quiet shades. \n
For them there was an eloquent voice in all \n
The sylvan pomp of woods, the golden sun, \n
The flowers, the leaves, the river on its way, \n
Blue skies, and silver clouds, and gentle winds, \n
The swelling upland, where the sidelong sun \n
Aslant the wooded slope, at evening, goes, \n
Groves, through whose broken roof the sky looks in, \n
Mountain, and shattered cliff, and sunny vale, \n
The distant lake, fountains, and mighty trees, \n
In many a lazy syllable, repeating \n
Their old poetic legends to the wind. \n
And this is the sweet spirit, that doth fill \n
The world; and, in these wayward days of youth, \n
My busy fancy oft embodies it, \n
As a bright image of the light and beauty \n
That dwell in nature; of the heavenly forms \n
We worship in our dreams, and the soft hues \n
That stain the wild bird's wing, and flush the clouds \n
When the sun sets. Within her tender eye \n
The heaven of April, with its changing light, \n
And when it wears the blue of May, is hung, \n
And on her lip the rich, red rose. Her hair \n
Is like the summer tresses of the trees, \n
When twilight makes them brown, and on her cheek \n
Blushes the richness of an autumn sky, \n
With ever-shifting beauty. Then her breath, \n
It is so like the gentle air of Spring, \n
As, front the morning's dewy flowers, it comes \n
Full of their fragrance, that it is a joy \n
To have it round us, and her silver voice \n
Is the rich music of a summer bird, \n
Heard in the still night, with its passionate cadence. \n<|endoftext|>

i did not know sin meant chains \n
so full of them all over my physique \n

could lead to this woeful state \n
only god now is boundless freedom \n
the paradise boundless freedom \n
rhe sky boundless freedom \n
the sea boundless freedom \n
and to enjoy all these now in chain, \n
boundless the hurt is the heart \n
injurious chain on every inch of my physique \n
that jolts me for their wants \n
every minute of the day \n
and to know that i will pass this chain \n
down to every of my offsprings \n
binding them down to earth \n
till they become just dust and bones \n
chained, chained, chained, \n
this hateful long chain the devil spawned \n
that laid end to end \n
could snake its way round the world \n
this hateful chain that circles the body \n
imprisons it, hurtful as red hot iron \n
how stealthily it works day by day \n
tightening its grip \n
till i am wrinkled, bent, and bedridden \n
till only the last breath would release me \n
of its curse \n
this chain that torture me for wordly needs \n
oh god, how hateful you are \n
to bind me in these red hot chains! ! ! \n
note: \n
chain refers to the blood vessels round our body \n
they indeed resemble a chain \n

until this chain exacted its wants \n<|endoftext|>

Sparrows were feeding in a freezing drizzle \n
That while you watched turned into pieces of snow \n

And then they clearly flew instead of fell. \n<|endoftext|>
