When anger plagues the heart it seems \n
The words we say hurt so much more. \n
Tempers may fly, break at the seams, \n
As we try to even the score. \n
When anger plagues the heart it seems \n
We forget the good times we had. \n
We dump the joys, the hopes, and dreams, \n
And just magnify all the bad. \n
When anger plagues the heart it seems \n
We tend to inflict useless pain. \n
But after the fight, some light beams \n
Just like the sun shines after rain. \n

I had a friend so blessed with wealth, \n
Owned a house and vast properties, \n
She had one brother of poor health, \n
Brain damaged with lost memories. \n
I had a cousin blessed with wealth, \n
Loved money so much won't spend it, \n
Held it like ice cream, watched it melt- \n
And the joy of life he'd forfeit. \n
I had an aunt so blessed with wealth, \n
Her heart was cold and uncaring. \n
Money seemed to numb all she felt, \n
It prevented her from loving. \n
I may not be quite blessed with wealth \n
But God gave me more than just things. \n
Through all my joys and tears He held \n
This life - I'm thankful for living. \n

Two can stand on parallel lines, \n
Unburdened by useless fighting \n
The people's good clearly defined, \n
Down the Peace road they'll be walking. \n
Offense always breeds due defense, \n
Goals are not gained by sheer cunning. \n
When men live in coexistence, \n
Down the Peace road they'll be walking. \n
Refusal to this is foul Hate, \n
Blinded, can't see where it's going. \n
If leaders' pride they will negate \n
Down the Peace road they'll be walking. \n

Life's sorrows, strife, or joys serene, \n
depend on chance - perspective seen \n
half full, half empty, who'll disclose: \n
Time flows, who knows truth when life goes? \n
Though urban smog clogs, pastures green \n
await fate's call, what might have been \n
may still become before dumb close: \n
Time flows, who knows truth when life goes? \n
Whence spring trade winds, here warm, there keen, \n
here hope for scope, there snare unseen, \n
what rules rich pride, switch onward blows \n
Time flows, who knows truth when life goes? \n
Here hope for scope, there narrow, mean, \n
which envies dreams' sweet seventeen, \n
when mortal harvests what he sows \n
Time flows, who knows truth when life goes? \n
Some take advantage, some pride preen, \n
take much for granted, some vent spleen, \n
then end bare pickings for the crows. \n
Time flows, who knows truth when life goes? \n
Some help their neighbours, some demean \n
through envy, spite, fears foul, unclean, \n
mental mosaics merge, life shows \n
Time flows, who knows truth when life goes? \n
Beyond black hole what soul may glean \n
insight not superficial sheen, \n
life justified despite knocks, blows. \n
Time flows, who knows truth when life goes? \n
The need for creeds seems vain smokescreen \n
to smooth fears which fast years can't screen, \n
the clock winds down till last repose, \n
Time flows, who knows truth when life goes? \n<|endoftext|>

Sometimes Life gives a crushing blow \n
That leaves one numbed from all the pain. \n
Thoughts are swayed to stay or go - \n
Whether to find new love again. \n
Lessons are marked and truly deep \n
Thoughts remind of love forsaken. \n
Fears may bar new paths to keep - \n
Whether to find new love again. \n
But like the new day, Hope rises, \n
It may not be true for all men, \n
Someone may come, the choice changes - \n
Whether to find new love again. \n

Dramatic Monologue \n
Fragrant Thorns \n
(Solitary Chamber. Heart breaking melodious music is flowing silently. Young Ren is looking pale, soliloquizing.) \n
Young Ren: Sweet Flance! \n
Can you hear me? \n
I do know you can never see me now; \n
But hear me - my words at least! \n
Feel my heart that hangs on nothing; \n
Yet resting itself on my unrequited love. \n
Hear me! Do hear me! \n
Send thy spirit unto me awhile, \n
And hearken my silent words. \n
Dear Flance! \n
Thou must be now with thy partner \n
Breaking thy footprints with me once; \n
Yet ne’er am I angry with thee. \n
From him I should not take thee away; \n
Yet listen unto me awhile. \n
Dear Flance! \n
I loved thee not at the very first sight \n
Like Orlando and Rosalind - \n
Orlando was a wrestler, \n
Rosalind was a fair lady. \n
Their love began at an arena in a contest - \n
Rosalind in the guise of Ganymede, \n
Their love passed thro’ rustic lands \n
Symbolizing the art of Nature, \n
Their love stirred the young hearts \n
With wonder and fancy. \n
Sweet Flance! \n
Romeo died of Juliet and Juliet of Romeo - \n
Breaking endurance to chaos. \n
There was poison in their love. \n
Dear Flance! \n
Jealousy lingered in the fatal love \n
Betwixt Othello and Desdemona, \n
At night their love was born, \n
At night their love was dead \n
When blackened by the candle light. \n
Dear Flance! \n
Lysander loved Hermia \n
And sought fanciful beings \n
For their fanciful union. \n
Dear Flance! \n
Know you, Keats died of consumption? \n
His love for Fanny Brown was limitless, \n
And so burst into tears. \n
Oh! No! \n
MY love for thee can never have comparisons. \n
Sweet Flance! \n
Blossomed my love for thee \n
When thou wert young, \n
When thou wert beautiful; \n
Yet it’s not of Romeo’s, \n
Of Othello’s, \n
Of Lysander’s, \n
Of Dante’s, \n
Of Keats’, \n
For they died of their love. \n
My love for thee be unrequited; yet ineffable. \n
You felt not my love; yet I cannot be Romeo. \n
Know you? \n
Romeo loved Juliet, \n
Juliet loved Romeo, \n
And so they died without love. \n
Loved I thy heart, not thee? \n
Love I thy heart, not thee? \n
And so, \n
We live in remembrance of each other. \n
Dear Flance! \n
Thou must be now living with thy partner \n
Rejoicing in his presence. \n
Can you think of me living myself. \n
Rejoicing in my thoughts of you? \n
Here am I in the air with wings waxed; \n
Yet I’ll not fall down to fragments. \n
Know you? \n
I am to lead my life myself, \n
But with thoughts of you! \n
For \n
Loved I thee, still I love thee, \n
Ever I’ll love thee. \n
(Young Ren sheds tears) \n
Sweet Flance! \n
My tears are not of my loneliness sans thee; \n
But born of bliss within me with thoughts of you. \n

dramatic-monologue \n
In each year season changes one after another \n
Change its color, beauty, smell and ceremony \n
I pass on and on and more quickly forever; \n
I pass through winter, summer, cold, hot, rainy \n
In autumn I see how nature takes a movement! \n
In spring I see how nature becomes so funny! \n
In each season nature and its inhabitants get \n
New arrangement of being, doing and feeling \n
They usually gain something new and lose old; \n
Sometimes they praise highly of me well calling \n
Sometimes sadly they lament and too scold me \n
I hear them all but usually I have to do nothing; \n
Day after day and year after year I am only me \n
Things and beings will go out I have only to see. \n

A tender, soft leaf once I was \n
Sprouting from bud I was watching beautiful nature \n
Soft sun shone on me \n
And rain drops drenched me much \n
Winds always caused me swing \n
Little birds sat on branch under me \n
It was spring \n
I was a single one in many \n
You, poet could not find me, \n
If I didn't mention you; \n
Slowly summer approached \n
Hardened my softness \n
That hard sun couldn't harm my face \n
One morning rain came \n
Make me much satisfied; \n
Then one morning many fallen leaves I found \n
Fall came I guessed \n
Next morning \n
I found myself on ground \n
A yellow fallen leaf; \n
Then dew drops and snow began to fall \n
I saw wrapping warm clothes people around; \n
But I was getting dried. \n

Whether things will go normal \n
Or will happen the occult \n
But always happens universal \n
Dirt and dust will simply out, \n
After day long wind and rain \n
From fields and farmhouse hay \n
Then, the night will fall when \n
Disappears gloomy, weary day; \n
Myriads stars are in milky way \n
Some looking at me will hark \n
My past, my present, anyway \n
And thus, I will stand in the dark; \n
Some stars will fall on the ground \n
And flowers will wither all around. \n

Nature teaches humans what are great \n
And urges to be properly great in mind \n
High like mountain and sky like vast \n
Deep like ocean and flat like soil and mud; \n
To circle around the animal planet like air \n
To provide necessary elements to animal, \n
To stretch hands everywhere like water \n
Without which surviving is impossible; \n
Nature has been made great consequently \n
Doing ever fruitful, useful, helpful and nice; \n
Doing all things and beings room exactly \n
No want of any element in need and use; \n
Without nature humans can never survive \n
Should take natural teachings and archive. \n

a day filled with tribulations \n

that I somehow managed to surmount... \n
But no, never, no broken promises— \n
Despite all ourproblems, our differences, \n

Which o're Corinna's youthful cheeks are spred, \n
Look pale and bleak, and shew a purple hew, \n
And Violets staine, where Roses lately grew. \n
Galla alone, with wonder we behold, \n
Maintain her Spring, and still out-brave the Cold; \n
Her constant white does not to Frost give place, \n
Nor fresh Vermillion fade upon her face: \n
Sure Divine beauty in this Dame does shine? \n

I can’t stop crying. \n
My eyes are like peddler women. \n
What they buy is: you are gone. \n
What they sell is: tears, \n
And business is good: \n
Enough tears for a jeweled necklace. \n
I am weeping here in the ruins \n
Where lovers used to live. \n
I can’t hear a thing. \n
I can’t say a word. \n
Wasn’t it enough for you \n
To break our home when you left? \n
Why did you break my heart? \n
The place doesn’t even look the same. \n
I don’t even recognize it. \n
Only my heart tells me if I am in the right place; \n
My eyes deny it. \n
Good luck on your journey. \n
You take with you the tears that I gave you \n
And my sleep that you stole. \n
I could forget my lover \n
Were it not for the stars \n
Which remind me. \n
The moon is conspiring against the sun, her king. \n
She thinks he has gone traveling in the Western Sea \n
And drowned. \n
Unsheathing her swords of lightning \n
She strikes the earth’s back with her staffs of fire. \n
The lightning bolts dance, \n
Swirl their golden skirts and sway. \n
The earth joins battle in its armor of darkness; \n
The stars hurl their javelins of light. \n
The moon flees and grows dim, \n
But now she stands on the face of the sky \n
Like a golden brooch on a cloak, \n
Her face red with the dust of battle \n
Like the face of a queen leading her armies. \n
I am a shepherd. My flock is the stars; \n
I herd them, leading them home. \n
They move as slowly as if they were sick or lame. \n
I weep for the Twins, who are always apart. \n
I am jealous of the Pleiades, who are together for eternity. \n
Does Orion reach out his hand to touch his neighbor? \n
Or to measure the distance between the spheres? \n
Where is the sun? Has its chariot broken a wheel? \n
Has the road it travels been cut off? \n
The gates of the East—are they locked? \n
When will ebony turn to pearls? \n
When will this black veil be lifted and the white cheek revealed? \n
I hate this night. \n
The moon looks to me \n
Like a scab on the skin of an African. \n
When I see the first tongues of fire, I shall rejoice. \n
A night like an African. \n
“Can the Ethiopian change his skin?” \n
A sky like a leopard, \n
Spotted with stars. \n
Dark forevermore. \n
I give up. My eyes will never see the warm sun. Too late. \n
A breeze is stealing between the trees, \n
Whispering to the willows a rumor of a secret love. \n
The birds are twittering. \n
Far away, a pigeon-dove murmurs a poem. As the night folds her wings, \n
A light rain of beauty is falling, \n
Raining down the dew of love like manna. \n
There is a fragrance like incense or myrrh. \n
Has Solomon sent me a poem, perfumed, wrapped to a pigeon-dove’s leg? \n
From the poem’s lines of black letters, greetings break forth like the dawn, \n
Light amid the grey morning, \n
Letters ink-black as night, but words bright as the dawn, \n
Like a girl who hides her cheeks behind her dark hair. \n
A poem not just perfumed but mined from the hills of perfume! \n
“Comely am I and black,” \n
Pitch-black letters like the black tents of Kedar \n
On paper like the white tents of Solomon. \n
Marvels never seen: letters carved from fiery rock. \n
Shall these pages contain the flame of his words \n
Or will they feed the fire? When did fire not conquer straw? \n
These words are locked now within my heart, \n
Engraved there letter for letter \n
Placed there forever. \n
His poem is like a tapestry woven by the hands of thought, \n
Framed with beauty, \n
Worn like a crown. \n
His poem is like a song of jeweled fruit, \n
A song, a poem for the reader to taste. \n
My tongue shall sing it on a glass of wine. \n
Here, for you, are the fruits of my poetry \n
Ripe after months of waiting. \n
But for my love you need never wait. \n
A poem from your friend, \n
Whose fame has waited \n
Until after his best days. \n
Now he is so well known \n
That what he does not write \n
May be an oral tradition. \n
He follows generous friends \n
And seeks out their company. \n
He is never far away. \n
If they are a hand, he is their thumb. \n
Men sleep until the dawn awakes them, \n
But his soul is awake and his heart wakes the dawn, \n
To seek the love of his friend, \n
Pure love, inside and out. \n
Take from my clumsy lips these golden words of poetry; \n
Place them around your neck. \n
Wear them like a bracelet. \n
For they are daughters of love, mined from the hill of love, \n
Given to you for your love like a dowry. \n
The morning breeze warms the face of every lover, \n
But to me it shall always say: All is well with Solomon. Shalom. \n

È un poeta chi canta \n
È uno scrittore chi racconta \n
Le sue storie \n
È un autore chi si esprime \n
È un oratore delle più alte stime \n
Chi esamina le memorie. \n
È un uomo coraggioso chi si esternalizza \n
È un poeta chi analizza \n
Azioni, finzioni e fatti. \n
È un fratello chi combatte \n
È un soldato nel bel mezzo di una guerra \n
Chi predica amore e pace. \n

canzone \n
Flowers open, dreams form, \n
Swarm to me perpetual stars! \n
And down below \n
But in slow motion \n
Trees by fibrous roots \n
Renew sensations \n
Through the forest sounding boards. \n
We, with one accord, \n
Must now embrace our tactile world \n
And let the Spirits be \n
To vague philosophy. \n<|endoftext|>

dizain \n
Sing with the heart and dance with the soul \n
keep all smiles, magical words will flow, \n
The happy feets will join your show and roll, \n
Call from far, near, above or below, \n
So, fair old tunes be enjoyed by low, \n
Body will dance in a maze of to-and-fro, \n
The like minded pairs will come and go, \n
Triumph will return with fragrance of glee, \n
The moments of life will increase a row, \n
And dreams will say- we are now free! \n<|endoftext|>
dizain \n
As, to the pipe, with rhythmic feet \n
In windings of some old-world dance, \n
The smiling couples cross and meet, \n
Join hands, and then in line advance, \n
So, to these fair old tunes of France, \n
Through all their maze of to-and-fro, \n
The light-heeled numbers laughing go, \n
Retreat, return, and ere they flee, \n
One moment pause in panting row, \n
And seem to say--Vos plaudite! \n<|endoftext|>
dizain \n
You want to leave,no words are left to say. \n
Letting go is hard but I must move on. \n
A river of tears cannot make you stay. \n
If it's for the vows,it's just a prison. \n
A breath of freedom is enough reason \n
For goodbyes to be said,to heal our hearts. \n
Pain may torment but in time it departs, \n
Scars don't hurt, they're what lessons are about. \n
Just don't step on shards of my broken heart, \n
When you close that door and as you go out \n

He'd intend to cook beans accompanied by rice, \n
Then relayed his thought first. \n
He pretend he wouldn't wash the rice, \n
And dismayed when the pair did rest. \n
Then prepared he the beans before the grain, \n
Washed clearly to purge the dirts. \n
He adhered to the boiling water as urged by his vein, \n
And hastely put the beans next. \n
The rice was soften as the foam, \n
To put the beans now, the rice is marred. \n
The ice of heat could not the bean's starch withhold, \n
The mute force could not press it flat. \n
He's ought to make rice before the beans, \n
But sort inverse, had wrought another meal. \n

Decanter waist with Waif-thin body in \n
Ochrous hue skin - I'm bowled by star-beam gold spools of \n
Hair swooned down your drop dead gorgeous moon shaped face: chick \n
hides a swan's neck! When you smile: oyster white \n
Teeth lit up room, kills my senses \n

You hold key of my heart with your sea-nymph \n
Ears, pixie's nose! You stole my Soul with those leafy \n
Eyes: two beryl green gems, melts into snow! You take my \n
Breath out with your hips, curves into Figure \n
Eight, down runs to two thighs: nice oh \n
Guys, ends in legs: twin twines! \n
You're my girlf, I'm \n

Bitten \n
By oxbow your \n

Your schmaltzy voice has hornbill's trills \n
With nature's halo! with your A1 manners \n
Flows Niles, makes plains Where trees, blooms, fruits, live - animals \n
fleas, bees love - in your eyes, blue-seas live and light-stars love! \n
Love lift me up, light my life on moon, sun \n

verse \n
Go, wailing verse, the infants of my love, \n
Minerva-like, brought forth without a Mother: \n
Present the image of the cares I prove; \n
Witness your Father's grief exceeds all other. \n
Sigh out a story of her cruel deeds, \n
With interrupted accents of despair: \n
A monument that whosoever reads \n
May justly praise, and blame my loveless Fair. \n
Say her disdain hath dried up my blood, \n
And starved you, in succours still denying; \n
Press to her eyes, importune me some good; \n
Waken her sleeping pity with your crying. \n
Knock at that hard heart, beg till you have mov'd her, \n
And tell th'unkind how dearly I have lov'd her. \n<|endoftext|>
verse \n
Past the graveyard down the road, \n
Lives or dies a man out cold \n
Every minute is a burning desire \n
For him to feel there's nothing higher. \n
Hope he knows is also despair, \n
The lie of the land begins to stare \n
Every minute is a burning desire \n
For him to feel there is nothing higher. \n
Will any hand rise from the many dead? \n
Maybe it's time to be quiet instead \n
Breath continues no more so \n
The dead is the living let the dying grow \n
The man with nothing in him to feel \n
A sorrow or regret meaningless to conceal \n
Yet every minute is a burning desire \n
For him to feel there's nothing higher! \n<|endoftext|>
verse \n
your voices of golden verse \n
wake me up from the deep slumber \n
as coursed from the dream heartful \n
rousing the warmth of love endeared \n
As surfing the beach as morning delight \n
when awaiting the golden sun yet to rise \n
to delve the dew from the depth of night \n
love as yet dazzles across swaying of the leaf \n
as revered by the mist of the night.last \n
when you make your day promising bright \n
muses over morning to rave up the night \n
suave and serene yet in blazing the love \n
wishes to the sky reasoned by the blue moon. \n
let all your prayers be blossomed hue \n
and be sparkling like a fragrant rose \n
yet scattering like a rain in summer \n
quenching thirst of smile to the green \n
when each speckle of desire raved up yet \n
like flairs of a night in the full moon blue \n
with the beams of essence in ascension \n
being sheltered and safe yet reasoned too. \n<|endoftext|>
verse \n
And now I have another lad! \n
No longer need you tell \n
How all my nights are slow and sad \n
For loving you too well. \n
His ways are not your wicked ways, \n
He's not the like of you. \n
He treads his path of reckoned days, \n
A sober man, and true. \n
They'll never see him in the town, \n
Another on his knee. \n
He'd cut his laden orchards down, \n
If that would pleasure me. \n
He'd give his blood to paint my lips \n
If I should wish them red. \n
He prays to touch my finger-tips \n
Or stroke my prideful head. \n
He never weaves a glinting lie, \n
Or brags the hearts he'll keep. \n
I have forgotten how to sigh- \n
Remembered how to sleep. \n
He's none to kiss away my mind- \n
A slower way is his. \n
Oh, Lord! On reading this, I find \n
A silly lot he is. \n<|endoftext|>
verse \n
Your eyes are the colour of water \n
but it is completely frozen over \n

Alas, that is something I can't do \n
unless you're willing to let yourself go \n
and press your body against my body \n
in hopes that the sparks will make a fire \n
So until our bones lie in the ground \n
I will have a fire inside of me \n
and it is burning like Andromeda \n
just because you aren't here for me \n
but I wonder, if you come around \n
will I want to burn for you much more? \n<|endoftext|>
verse \n
MARK yon runnel how ’tis flowing, \n
Like a sylvan spirit dreaming \n
Of the Spring-blooms near it blowing \n
And the sunlight in it gleaming! \n
Where that shelving rock is spied, \n
There with a smooth warbling slide \n
It lapses down into a cool \n
And brimming, not o’erflowing pool. \n
Then between its narrow’d banks \n
Playing mellow gurgling pranks, \n
It gushes till a channel’d stone \n
Gives it a more strenuous tone; \n
Or with an under-swirling spread \n
Over a wide pebbled bed \n
It bubbles with a gentle pleasure, \n
Ere some new mood change the measure: \n
Such a runnel typeth well \n
The sweet wild verse of ‘Christabel;’ \n
But what \n
The Wonder-World it warbles through? \n<|endoftext|>
verse \n
‘The sky is encompassed by clouds. \n
With the hue of Tamā la trees \n

This dear Kā hnā \n

O Rā dhā! You therefore please \n
accompany him to reach home aright.’ \n
Thus by the words of King Nanda, \n
stepped ahead both Rā dhā and Mā dhava \n
towards the tree of bowers on the way. \n
Glory to their plays of love, secret and gay, \n
on the bank of river Yamunā. \n

verse \n
Light has exposed the landscape to its form. \n
Mood is rebuked of all its artifice. \n
Wind moves like winter through the naked trees. \n
I ask you for a leaf, but there is none. \n
Instead, you offer me a weather coat, \n
Gray as warm words reduced to whispering. \n
You tell me that November loves old bones. \n
Your frost accent is quite believable. \n
You paint a picture of our private sky. \n
The light falls faint upon my closing eyes. \n
Held close within a margin of rare words, \n
Stillness sings like a fragile, yellow bird. \n
Against the glass old memories ebb and flow. \n
A touch of verse becomes a touch of snow. \n
Our tiny world is slipping into space. \n
Only your precious hands hold it in place. \n

I’ve lost one verse \n
With tinkling lines, \n
I’ve lost a verse, \n
It’s somewhere else… \n
I sought the leaf, \n
But couldn’t find, \n
Even from the disc \n
It vanished. \n
I cried and cried \n
For that little verse, \n
In my soul it lay \n
Like a winged word, \n
It lay there \n
Like grief and anguish. \n
That bright and sincere thought – \n
That verse remained in the past. \n
I’m tired of grief and sorrow, \n
Sorrow has seized me at last… \n

verse \n
Vanity within a verse scheme gave \n
Each alphomega, each word's aura, ease. \n
Run through in print, as content rhymes to please, \n
Springs, rising sprightly, links few see, most crave. \n
Apart here thread we tight, taut, autoclave, \n
Tacit, yes, yet pate-play may seem tease. \n
In lines smooth I express this hidden frieze, - \n
Lucid keepsake, light, keen, subtle stave. \n
Emphatic theme expect, - interpret rave! \n
Vain verse-vine vile? Voice very vivid? Seize \n
Externals terse are shade, sense secret keys. \n

On verdurd trees ye silver blossoms grow \n

The waves pushed on by waves in mountains ly \n
Mixd with ye clouds ye Parent waters fly \n

So lett thy temper due composure find \n

verse \n
What's the use hats off, when the person died, \n
What's the use of message which came after tide. \n
When hopes were dead & died every thought, \n

O Heart! go away from here and destroy thy notion, \n
What's the use of it if thou did after motion. \n
Alas! had we seen our goal alive, \n

Never, never dip your quill in \n
Ink that rushes from your heart. \n

on any other woman that he'd get withoh after to night i'd be positive of it \n
revenge can be so sweet \n
especially to a woman scorned \n
by a cheating man, and hisdirty little whore \n
i poured the sand into 4 wine glasses \n
and poured the gasoline, into 4 pretty vases \n
put all 8 containers onto a tray \n
with broken branches \n
and covered em up, with some fresh picked daises \n
i went back into the room \n
where he was laying on the floor \n
an then an unwanted image came to me \n
of him on top of her \n
and before \n
i could change my mind about the fantasy \n
i thought to myself no1 would ever get this close to him again \n
once i tore apart \n
his black cold heart \n
so i might as well go thru with it....and when \n
he begged for mercy, if he \n
began to beg and plead.... \n
here we go readers, were coming to an end \n
but its no way over for him.... \n
'are you ready, i asked, not paying him any mind' \n
'this was my revenge \n
my justice, and justice is swift, deaf and blind \n
when you are insanely out your mind..... \n
all that mattered now \n
is how... \n
he would suffer so... \n
i wanted him to realize, that \n
infact \n
i did know \n
what he'd been doing.... \n
all the cheating and screwing.... \n
god only knows how many other women there had been \n
and as a now religious person, i found \n
that iwas now bound \n
to make him suffer so 4 all his sins \n
im not sadistic, nor am i in to the black arts \n
but now was a good enough \n
time as any, to try out that stuff \n
it was his end, and my new start \n
no, im not going to kill him, what fun would that be \n
no i wanted him to live, the rest of his life with these memories \n
so i grabbed the pair of my fluffy handcuffs \n
and placed one on his wrist, \n
instantly his hand balled up into a fist \n
'i cooed to him, baby is that loose enough \n
he turned his arm from right to left, and did a couple twists, \n
and as he checked out the cuffs, i kissed him on the lips \n
he wiggled himself into a comfortable position \n
i softly whispered in his ear ' now my sexy man youve got to listen' \n
i took the loose handcuff and placed it around the leg of the bed \n
straightened out his legs and torso \n
and placed his hands above his head \n
this felt so good...ever more so \n
that my plan has become a reality \n
and im finally getting revenge while playing out my fantasy \n
i smiled, and he chuckled \n
i got his belt, and playfully hit him with the buckle \n
he winced in pain \n
i moaned his name \n
and playfully i tapped him again \n
thats when \n
softly but seductively I \n
asked my? s, staring him eye to eye \n
youve never asked me over the years \n
what gives me pleasure, what do i fear \n
why? ' \n
he stammered, 'i thought i fulfilled your every desire' \n
i thought i set your blood on fire' \n
i laughed, 'tonight...you are so right... \n
my blood is on fire... \n
but no its not 4m any sexual desire' \n
what a funny choice of words i thoght to myself \n
as i pictured him engulfed in the flames of eyernal hell \n
it was his turn \n
to be surrounded by fire \n
but he wouldnt burn \n
the flames were going to let him see \n
what he did to me... \n
by being a cheater, an obitual liar \n
gently i poured the sand around his large frame \n
next around his legs, head, and arms, i did the same.... \n
the ending was come near \n
the end of my game \n
as i had feared, ive went insane \n
around the thick sand that surrounded his body \n
i placed some huge rocks, from the room, that i collected from a hobby \n
readers, in a few moments i will draw you a diagram \n
of what i am to do to this weak pathetic man \n
noone should ever do this in real \n
these are just words, from something i feel \n
this is not but a dream.... \n
never to be played out.... \n
its poetic justice.....thats all this is about \n
so now surrounding his body was about 4 inches of sand \n
high, as well as wide \n
then outside the sand, a total of 8 huge rocks outlined the man \n
i made a vee, of sand and rocks \n
all up his outspread legs, up to his crotch \n
around the rocks, i pored out the 2 last \n
glasses of sand \n
even tho i was hell bent on revenge, and pain \n
and thru this i was going to vent \n
and even though i felt insane \n
there were rules, not to be broken in this game \n
i would hurt him, nor cause him physical pain \n
you do not cross a line, n cuz anyone harm \n
if you feel that way, you belong at the funny farm...lol \n
so here lay this cheater, the WOMANIZER \n
about to poop hisself, when he thought he was about to be set on fire \n
i took the branches, and plac ed em on the 2nd row of sand \n
then i started slowly pouring a thin line of gasoline \n
he started to holler out my name \n
i whispered to him...'you dont have to be afraid... \n
i just want to teach you a lesson, so next time you behave \n
he started to sream.. \n
as i poured out dropp by drop \n
the gasoline... \n
onto the old rotted branches, the sand was not oily but dry \n
this would contain the blaze....thats no lie \n
i took all the safety precautions, that i could take \n
there was no way i was ever gonna make a mistake \n
this was not real, it was fake \n
it was just my revenge, for my n his sake \n
he begged for me to stop \n
he cried and he screamed \n
it was almost done, for it was just a dream \n
nothing was as it seemed \n
it was to late \n
cuz i was filled with hate \n
and only his conscious would determine his fate.... \n
i opened the dresser drawer \n
and struck \n
a single match \n
he now knew he was stuck \n
between me and and the firey batch \n
of my insane inferno \n
it burned around him slow \n
as the embers grew, and began to glow \n
like a candle in the dead of night \n
it was a beautiful sight \n
i dropped a 2nd match \n
onto a branch \n
and as each 1 dropped, it was like dominoes falling, each one catched \n
fire, a little at a time \n
til there was a blazing fire \n
lighting up his whole outlinr \n
panicked stricken he looked up at me \n
'this is not a fantasy, this infact is insanity...' \n
no i replied.... \n
it is indeed my fantasy \n
with a twist of revenge \n
cuz you lied \n
when... \n
i didnt get to finish what i was about to say \n
'i dont want to play! ! ! ! ' \n
crying, he stuttered are you going to just stand there and watch me burn? ' \n
what can i say for u to stop this, whatever it is i learned...' \n
i threw back my head, and said \n
what did you learn....besides playing with fire will get you burned \n
you dont ev en know why i surrounded you by fire..... \n
you cheating liar.... \n
next time dont cheat, ....do not screw \n
on the 1 your with, when your suppossed to be true.... \n
or this just might happen again...my friend \n
dont break another heart, by being a womanizer \n
or youll get burned again \n
playing with that fire...' \n
speasking of which, the sand will keep you safe \n
just dont move an inch, or move anything out of its place \n
if a piece of wood happened to spark out of the fire \n
dont worry, you cheating liar.. \n
the rocks will catch them sparks...and if they dont \n
this is a small blaze, its under control it wont \n
reach your body, nor your face \n
just as long as you stat in place...' \n
the sand that outlines you \n
will keep the fire inside the two \n
circles i made around you \n
that i made...so you best behave.... \n
i got dressed and packed my things, i made sure to toss him the engagement ring \n
and as i was ready to leave \n
i poured water in a vase \n
and beside him i placed \n
it...with a towel, and a fire extinguisher \n
yeah i gave him an out, the womanizer \n
but i truth, i had placed em to far away... \n
i wanted him to stay, and pay... \n
in about an hour, the fire will begin to smolder \n
i said over my shoulder.. \n
do not worry.. \n
ive got to go, im in a hurry \n
you played me, i represent the fire \n
it often gets you burned...so for your sake i pray that youve learned \n
dont give in to your cheating desires \n
oh and your right about 1 thing i dont like confrontations \n
but as a woman, i will always be in control of my own situation \n
looks like the fires out, its just alot of smoke \n
i handed him the towel to breathe in so he didnt choke... \n
wait another 30 minutes, bcuz the rocks and floor will be hot \n
no plastic had melted \n
it was a clean fire, nothing had been welted \n
so goodbye...to a cheating *** \n
hope you have yourself a blast \n
now everytime you see or smell fire \n
you always remember this womans' desire \n
and now that ive imprinted onto your nightmares and dreams... \n
just remeber nothing is as it ever seems \n
ive given you something to fear and for every single tear \n
i was about to shed.. \n
this revenge was fittingf for a love now dead... \n
cuz lil' ol' me....will always be there \n
lurking around somewhere \n
in your haunted memories... \n
you deserved it...was she worth it.? ' \n
he woke up that more, to a faint smell of gas... \n
and beside him on the pillow was a bunch of ash.... \n
me and my suff...were gone..i had, had enough...i was done... \n
told you nothing is as it seems.... \n

verse \n
I. \n
Peradventure of old, some bard in Ionian Islands, \n
Walking alone by the sea, hearing the wash of the waves, \n
Learned the secret from them of the beautiful verse elegiac, \n
Breathing into his song motion and sound of the sea. \n
For as the wave of the sea, upheaving in long undulations, \n
Plunges loud on the sands, pauses, and turns, and retreats, \n
So the Hexameter, rising and singing, with cadence sonorous, \n
Falls; and in refluent rhythm back the Pentameter flows. \n
II. \n
Not in his youth alone, but in age, may the heart of the poet \n
Bloom into song, as the gorse blossoms in autumn and spring. \n
III. \n
Not in tenderness wanting, yet rough are the rhymes of our poet; \n
Though it be Jacob's voice, Esau's, alas! are the hands. \n
IV. \n
Let us be grateful to writers for what is left in the inkstand; \n
When to leave off is an art only attained by the few. \n
V. \n
How can the Three be One? you ask me; I answer by asking, \n
Hail and snow and rain, are they not three, and yet one? \n
VI. \n
By the mirage uplifted, the land floats vague in the ether, \n
Ships and the shadows of ships hang in the motionless air; \n
So by the art of the poet our common life is uplifted, \n
So, transfigured, the world floats in a luminous haze. \n
VII. \n
Like a French poem is Life; being only perfect in structure \n
When with the masculine rhymes mingled the feminine are. \n
VIII. \n
Down from the mountain descends the brooklet, rejoicing in \n
freedom; \n
Little it dreams of the mill hid in the valley below; \n
Glad with the joy of existence, the child goes singing and \n
laughing, \n
Little dreaming what toils lie in the future concealed. \n
IX. \n
As the ink from our pen, so flow our thoughts and our feelings \n
When we begin to write, however sluggish before. \n
X. \n
Like the Kingdom of Heaven, the Fountain of Youth is within us; \n
If we seek it elsewhere, old shall we grow in the search. \n
XI. \n
If you would hit the mark, you must aim a little above it; \n
Every arrow that flies feels the attraction of earth. \n
XII. \n
Wisely the Hebrews admit no Present tense in their language; \n
While we are speaking the word, it is is already the Past. \n
XIII. \n
In the twilight of age all things seem strange and phantasmal, \n
As between daylight and dark ghost-like the landscape appears. \n
XIV. \n
Great is the art of beginning, but greater the art is of ending; \n
Many a poem is marred by a superfluous verse. \n<|endoftext|>
verse \n
Empires are like the vast waves \n
Upon a never ending ocean of time \n
They start off humbly before rising \n
Out of the gloom of their origins. \n
Forever reaching up towards the \n
Sacred searing light of the heavens \n
Searching for a promise of power \n
That is never found, or fully realized. \n
Those that bare witness to it can \n
Only marvel at it’s sheer decadence \n
And it’s raw, unlimited power which \n
Drives it’s endless, unsatisfied greed. \n
As quickly as it appeared it sinks away \n
Into the oblivion of the darkness which \n
Gave it birth, only for another to follow \n
In its wake, thus the cycle goes ever on. \n<|endoftext|>

A POEM SHOULDN'T BE A RIDDLE \n
The truth is, do in the season; \n
Various farming and plantation. \n
Not every month but once in a year; \n
When conditions and climate favor! \n
In the history, many wrote riddle; \n
They were not understandable! \n
Still, they were liked by elite people; \n
Horses were found in the cloud by all! \n
I even don't understand their poems; \n
Elites approved their ignorant games! \n
Falsely regarded as poets worldwide; \n
Without constructing rhymes, they died! \n
Now, look! I have a different style; \n
To understand, none walks over a mile! \n
No hardship and very simple; \n
Because, a poem shouldn't be a riddle! \n
A poem shouldn't be made in a laboratory; \n
A poem should be natural, ordinary! \n
It is, what a poet sees what a poet writes; \n
No need to push readers for fights! \n
The truth is, do in the season; \n
With right farming and plantation. \n
To write, don't linger the entire year; \n
Write when condition and climate favor! \n
I even don't understand their poems; \n
Elites approved their ignorant games! \n
They are regarded as poets worldwide; \n
Readers are real thinkers to guide! \n

Readers should be aware of cultivation. \n

MY PRAYING, NOT A RIDDLE: \n
Praying for reality \n
i pray for the people in need en in sickness \n

that my life and theirs are alright, \n
that everything will work out. \n
the time i shut my eyesin that sleeping time, \n
between dream and reality \n
to when i open them again, i can feel a blissful harmony \n
in day's reality before facing my love and my duties. \n
praying helpsto just forget every hurt and grief for a time, \n
and have a clear connection with You, my God, my Saviour \n
afar from sin and death \n
close to our good health \n
to let go of the past and the present \n
to drift now into the future. \n
i pray for a life and love healthy and true \n
so that they can feel alive and be easy-happy \n
not for today only \n
i pray first for them, then for me \n
as long as they and i live \n
to live in a bright shining day \n
in greatest harmony \n
as long as they live and love each other \n
is my praying too difficult or too much my Lord? \n
to ask humbly for my own happiest moments \n
my own is also their own happiest events \n
their is a word for people i innately love, care and cherish \n
i expect Your Support my Lord and Your Bliss \n

Riddle \n
Where is the end of this life? \n
Death? \n
Then why is so much pain? \n
So much dream for relief? \n
Relief is false if death is final. \n
Where is the goal of life? \n
Where is this walk to go? \n
Where this road of life leads to? \n
Where, where is the ultimate destination? \n
Life is a journey to salvation, \n
From outward space to inner world, \n
From mundane to spiritual, \n
From life to deathless life. \n
What does the salvation mean? \n
Why so much urge to know? \n
Knowledge is useless in the end, \n
Death makes everything sod. \n
Endless is the way to walk, \n
The pathless is the path, \n
Through eternity the question remains? \n
What is life and what is death? \n
The mystics smile with deep Joy, \n
They seem to know the truth of truths, \n
They seem to know the false as false, \n
They are Knower of ultimate rule. \n
Life itself is a mystic to me, \n
Mystery, mystic and misery, \n
Every moment of joy seems false, \n
Every moment of sadness mystifies the mystery. \n
Feelings of love wash the heart, \n
Feelings of pain wash the mind, \n
Feelings of gratefulness wash the being, \n
Still all is hugged with \n
thin fence of Conundrum. \n
What is life and it's purpose? \n
What is death and how it fulfils life? \n
What is knowledge and it's relevance? \n
Everything is under the sheath of riddle. \n

Then who's the mortgagee? \n
Do we owe money in the moon, \n

And find no clear solution yet. \n
If all the earth is deep in debt, \n
Who is the creditor? \n
When men go into bankruptcy \n
The case is plain as day: \n
What is not in the dear wife's name \n
Grim creditors will promptly claim, \n
And assets melt away. \n
But when a whole wide world's in soak \n
And cannot raise the tin, \n
Here's where I half suspect a joke: \n
When all the earth goes stoney broke, \n
Who puts the bailiffs in? \n<|endoftext|>

I dream and dream \n
Of islands and highlands \n
Of meadows and woodlands \n
Of little waves with melodic sound \n
Of a river sliding downtown \n
Under the stars and sun and moon \n
I dream to be in places strange \n
To see girls wearing pink and boys orange \n
I dream to say so much \n
To my Mom and Dad \n
To my relatives and friends \n
But I speak silence \n
I dream to play game \n
I dream to know her name \n
But I speak silence…..no one me understands \n
I dream of a sweet maid smiling at me \n
Of a young lad teasing me \n
But I lie here desolate and bed-ridden \n
Living only in dreams \n
Can any one talk to me \n
To fill my eyes with tears \n
And can you guess what I am \n
So earnestly beseeching you to me care \n<|endoftext|>

riddle \n
The Riddle of Cosmos \n
The singularity of the Universe— \n
the Bing Bang rang \n
ten thousand million years ago— \n
was the theory propounded—So \n
the scientists in unison sang. \n
They set themselves to find \n
the important property that did bind \n
all matter to confer its mass, size and shape. \n
The riddle of the cosmos to solve \n
the physicists did evolve \n
"The Standard Model" of Particle Physics. \n
Fundamental particles twelve \n
of this theory \n
and fundamental forces four \n
save gravity \n
govern the dynamics \n
of the Universe. \n
In an invisible ubiquitous field \n
through the entire Universe' energy field \n
permeated an influence called Higgs field. \n
In Particle Physics \n
with his work on quantum mechanics \n
in the Universe' over-all dynamics \n
our Indian scientist " Bose" is seen \n
having worked with the famous Einstien \n
to have brought out the statistics, ‘Bose-Einstien'. \n
This earned the name ‘Boson' \n
for a sub-atomic particle \n
for a force carrying article. \n
By the English physicist Higgs \n
it was postulated \n
in the accepted "Standard Model of Physics" \n
that a missing piece existed. \n
In the jig-saw puzzle \n
called the Universe \n
the missing piece \n
was the particle ‘Higgs Boson' \n
now dubbed the ‘God Particle'— \n
since ‘tis everywhere and powerful \n
yet so hard to find and full! \n
The European Organization \n
For Nuclear Research (CERN) \n
took upon itself to learn \n
and detect the elusive particle. \n
(LHC) The Large Hadron Collidor \n
in the tunnels at a depth \n
of One hundred and seventy five metres \n
was built a looped pipe, \n
for a length of twenty seven kilometers \n
below the Swiss-French border. \n
‘Tis the world's biggest Physics machine \n
where research stations numerous sheen \n
are stationed underground \n
where thousands of scientists are bound \n
working all through day and night. \n
For this gargantuan experiment \n
USD forty million \n
has been spent by Indian Government. \n
The pooled-in brains and skill \n
of twenty thousand scientists around the world, \n
(with hundred Indians playing a role substantial) \n
have built these pyramids of the 21st century. \n
Two proton beams \n
are accelerated by the LHC deeds \n
to very high speeds \n
to collide at the allied \n
speed of light. \n
Quarks and gluons \n
inside the protons \n
collide and explode \n
with high energy \n
creating the ‘Higgs Boson' epiphany. \n
In trying to unravel the mystery \n
behind the structure of the Universe \n
two laboratories at CERN \n
took upon the mission \n
to work independently \n
and bechanced at the same decision. \n
The discovery so desperate \n
for the new missing particle \n
lends a unified description \n
of the disparate \n
forces of Nature's inscription. \n
This announcement historic \n
by the observation conclusive \n
of the Higgs-Boson particle \n
till now elusive \n
was made in an atmosphere electric \n
on the fourth of July 2012—a Wednesday— \n
A red - letter day! \n
This is not the end of the quest \n
but ‘tis only the beginning. \n
For it is incumbent \n
on the scientific community \n
to crack many more riddles best \n
that form ninety-six percent of the Universe \n
like Super-symmetry, Dark energy, \n
Dark matter and Anti-matter \n
that stay unresolved unto eternity. \n<|endoftext|>

As bespoke by sanguine, yet ironically, you stumble amidst a thicker mist than most, \n
Dessicated and diseased, you hunch as a spider: stealing, binding, and defiling experiences never meant for you........ \n<|endoftext|>

As I see this you \n
Are still in direct cheat. \n

conceit \n
By Stanley Collymore \n
Death has its own characteristic methods and distinctive \n
means of doing things and achieving whatever it wants, \n
and simply doesn't care whether or not its specifically \n
targeted acquisitions, mutually or else unilaterally \n
acquired, actually pleases anyone or, more likely \n
than not, doesn't. So it's utterly pointless then \n
for any one either to waste time obsessively \n
conjecturing about the inevitable, stupidly \n
assume they can indefinitely postpone \n
the inescapable or, for that matter, deem they're capable \n
of successfully challenging the unavoidable. Yet the \n
inevitability of these indisputable truths constantly \n
fails to register with the coterie of obsessively \n
grasping, persistently warmongering and the \n
purblind, lunatic well-heeled class; their \n
similarly greedy, likeminded, wholly \n
uncontrolled, unconscionable and \n
biddable surrogates ceaselessly \n
ready and willing not only to \n
indulge but also fervently \n
implement every aspect \n
of their demonstrably \n
odious shenanigans \n
and the dishonest \n
artifices which \n
they forever \n
safeguard \n
in mind. \n
And all this reinforced by the pathetic and toadying actions \n
of the dim-witted, thoroughly indoctrinated, absolutely \n
class conscious subjugated, aspirant social climbing \n
and easily manipulated Plebeian masses, and all of \n
whom are conjoined in a self-delusional pact that \n
is patently oblivious to the fact that none of this \n
either makes any sense whatsoever to rational \n
human beings, or more profoundly in this \n
ludicrous equation that's being proffered \n
that the Grim Reaper whose call it is and always was \n
doesn't really give a toss what any of these utterly \n
self-delusional berks are up to when he regards \n
the time is appropriate to act; and significantly \n
is also totally aware, even if they aren't, that \n
there's absolutely nothing any of them or \n
the wealth which they've vaingloriously \n
accumulated can do -in terms that are \n
either clearly implausibly concrete \n
or plausibly negligible - to stave \n
off in any conceivable manner \n
what incontrovertibly will be \n
for each and every one of \n
them, and noticeably so, \n
the closing chapter and, \n
moreover, a manifestly \n
for all those involved \n
in this rather odious \n
and grasping trend \n
an ineluctable and \n
most proper end! \n

Author's Remarks: \n
Man's inhumanity to man is ever prevalent on a daily basis and money compounded by the obsessive pursuit of it at any cost and no matter who is dismissively and uncaringly trampled over in the process to acquire it and regardless of the means employed to get it, or how many will go hungry, homeless, be abandoned or actually die in self-serving and wholly unwarranted wars to satisfy the incessant avarice of those for whom it's not only their sole raison d'être for existing but also their omnipotent god and just goes to show how deep the abyss of depravity is that now enfolds so many of human kind. \n
And who in their grotesque and obsessive greed noticeably and unfalteringly conjoined with their purblind stupidity and a shocking proclivity for ceaselessly repeating the same mistakes render them to be nothing more than brainless automatons that don't seem to have even grasped the idea that for all their nefarious schemes and intrigues they've no choice but to exit this world, when the Grim Reaper dispassionately uses his scythe to effectively mow them down, as they initially arrived in it. In other words, with absolutely nothing; for not an iota of what they spent their pathetic lives cruelly and graspingly garnering, to the gross disadvantage of others, can they take with them; and all dead bodies whether of the poor or the rich, unless cremated, ultimately rot and smell the same. Worth thinking about! \n<|endoftext|>
conceit \n
Self conceit and self love are a different thing \n
The self conceited expect others their praises to sing \n
But those who love themselves love other people too \n
Herein lay the big difference between the two \n
Self conceited people are of narcisstic kind \n
Any excuse for to talk of themselves they will find \n
But self love quite different to conceit very different indeed \n
For to be a good person self love you do need \n
As different 'twould seem as a weed to a rose \n
Just one way to describe them one would have to suppose \n
Self conceited people of their own lives only wish to hear \n
That themselves only matter seems obviously clear \n
But those who love themselves to others love can give \n
And without self adulation they gladly can live. \n<|endoftext|>

Yours own hands once loved me \n
Cared of me \n
Fed me \n
Took me walking to ever green path \n
In life I found a great rath; \n
Why are those now keeping me far? \n
Torturing me more \n
Throwing me to your hands made fire, \n
I don't know where to go \n
Leaving my homeland printed my toe; \n
I am afraid of those hands will kill me \n
Will cut me \n
Will tear me \n
In your hands made artificial hell \n
Beside your so called prayer hall. \n

conceit \n
Being human, \n
we first explained the world \n
to ourselves via human nature, \n
based on the observations we'd made \n
of our own and others' behavior. \n
The Earth and the Sky, \n
as entities, mated \n
thus initiating all of creation. \n
Completing the personification, \n
they were given appellations \n
such as Geb and Nut in Egypt. \n
In Greece, Gaia and Uranus. \n
Eventually institutionalized religions, \n
appropriated pithy, pagan observations \n
and warped them to suit the tenets \n
of Over Lords claiming to be agents \n
of the T.H.E. LORD \n
in order to continue raping, \n
not only the people, but the Earth, \n
to further entrench \n
their testosterone-driven domination. \n
Today we self-servingly apply our own motives \n
to everything we see and hear around us, \n
the essence of repression and projection. \n
Sigmund Freud would have been so proud. \n
This indulgent, \n
narcissistic fixation \n
- navel gazing - \n
is interrupted only \n
in the face of evidence \n
of our wish to deny Nature's imprint, \n
and sever the apron strings/umbilicus \n
by trying to rise above her, \n
and since we are OF her, \n
above ourselves, \n
which is as impossible \n
as the epithet anatomical \n
'Why don't you go f*** yourself' \n
(But we have done so, have we not?) \n

Anarchy, mere madness is loose, \n

a country is laid waist, in merriment \n

farmers are driven from their property \n

with their bare lives from some murderous crowds, \n
with mouth gaping \n
he smiles on the conquest of fertile farmland, \n
causing famine, in victory holds up a hand. \n
While havoc reigns some blood flows everywhere, \n
chaos is spreading, \n
the opposition is sent to prison, \n
he is leading \n
the country to ruin, its falling apart, \n
its degrading, \n
it looses all kinds of decent order, \n
some millions flee south and cross the border. \n
Without any conviction destruction \n
is on the earth, \n
while people want to rob, rape, pillage and kill; \n
are told from birth \n
that they have been robbed from a future, \n
anger they girth; \n

poplars quiver \n
as the breeze time and again rushes through them, \n
the small river \n
is slowly flowing twisting to the sea \n
birds deliver \n
worms, seed and fruit chirping to new hatchlings, \n
cheerful they sing and fly and slap their wings. \n
It feels as if all the time in the world \n
we still have got \n
when you give me a small token as a \n
forget-me-not; \n
time suddenly gets wings and I love you \n
more than a lot; \n
the sun rises and again it does descend \n
while all of life feels as it has no end. \n<|endoftext|>
cavatina \n
The eyes of my love shines like the sun, \n
summer fades, \n
in the presence of her most lovely smile, \n
autumn shades \n
against the colour of her vibrant hair, \n
spring degrades \n
against her charm and personality \n
and vivid she stays lingering with me. \n<|endoftext|>
cavatina \n
We strive in all what we do and we are \n
somehow for truth, \n
for something to outlast our humanity, \n
our dwindling youth \n
in a world that is in constant decay \n
but each untruth \n
in our humanity is buried deep \n
while in life we yearn, learn, laugh, play and weep. \n<|endoftext|>

Epistle # 101 \n
February 19, 2020 \n
You are my native \n
Remember an important thing, \n
While living in China \n
Corona Virus affected time \n
And area; \n
You do not leave it \n
Whether you are affected \n
Or non-affected, \n
When problem will be overcome \n
You can make a decision. \n<|endoftext|>
epistle \n
'Tis growne almost a danger to speake true \n
Of any good minde, now: There are so few. \n
The bad, by number, are so fortified, \n
As what th'have lost t'expect, they dare deride. \n
So both the prais'd, and praisers suffer: Yet, \n
For others ill, ought none their good forget. \n
I, therefore, who professe my selfe in love \n
With every vertue, wheresoere it move, \n
And howsoever; as I am at fewd \n
With sinne and vice, though with a throne endew'd; \n
And, in this name, am given out dangerous \n
By arts, and practise of the vicious, \n
Such as suspect themselves, and think it fit \n
For their owne cap'tall crimes, t'indite my wit; \n
I, that have suffer'd this; and, though forsooke \n
Of Fortune, have not alter'd yet my looke, \n
Or so my selfe abandon'd, as because \n
Men are not just, or keepe no holy lawes \n
Of nature, and societie, I should faint; \n
Or feare to draw true lines, 'cause others paint: \n
I, Madame, am become your praiser. Where, \n
If it may stand with your soft blush to heare, \n
Your selfe but told unto your selfe, and see \n
In my character, what your features bee, \n
You will not from the paper slightly passe: \n
No Lady, but, at sometime loves her glasse. \n
And this shall be no false one, but as much \n
Remov'd, as you from need to have it such. \n
Looke then, and see your selfe. I will not say \n
Your beautie; for you see that every day: \n
And so doe many more. All which can call \n
It perfect, proper, pure, and naturall, \n
Not taken up o' th'Doctors, but as well \n
As I, can say, and see it doth excell. \n
That askes but to be censur'd by the eyes: \n
And, in those outward formes, all fooles are wise. \n
Nor that your beautie wanted not a dower, \n
Doe I reflect. Some Alderman has power, \n
Or cos'ning Farmer of the customes so, \n
T'advance his doubtfull issue, and ore-flow \n
A Princes fortune: These are gifts of chance, \n
And raise not vertue; they may vice enhance. \n
My mirror is more subtill, cleare, refin'd, \n
And takes, and gives the beauties of the mind. \n
Though it reject not those of Fortune: such \n
As Blood, and Match. Wherein, how more than much \n
Are you engaged to your happie fate, \n
For such a lot! that mixt you with a State \n
Of so great title, birth, but vertue most, \n
Without which, all the rest were sounds, or lost. \n
'Tis onely that can time, and chance defeat: \n
For he, that once is good, is ever great. \n
Wherewith, then, Madame, can you better pay \n
This blessing of your starres, than by that way \n
Of vertue, which you tread? what if alone? \n
Without companions? 'Tis safe to have none. \n
In single paths, dangers with ease are watch'd: \n
Contagion in the prease is soonest catch'd. \n
This makes, that wisely you decline your life, \n
Farre from the maze of custome, error, strife, \n
And keepe an even, and unalter'd gaite; \n
Not looking by, or back (like those, that waite \n
Times, and occasions, to start forth, and seeme) \n
Which though the turning world may dis-esteeme, \n
Because that studies spectacles, and showes, \n
And after varied, as fresh objects goes, \n
Giddie with change, and therefore cannot see \n
Right, the right way: yet must your comfort bee \n
Your conscience, and not wonder, if none askes \n
For Truths complexion, where they all weare maskes. \n
Let who will follow fashions, and attyres, \n
Maintaine their liedgers forth, for forrain wyres, \n
Melt downe their husbands land, to powre away \n
On the close groome, and page, on new-yeares day, \n
And almost, all dayes after, while they live; \n
(They finde it both so wittie, and safe to give) \n
Let 'hem on poulders, oyles, and paintings, spend, \n
Till that no usurer, nor his bawds dare lend \n
Them, or their officers: and no man know, \n
Whether it be a face they weare, or no. \n
Let 'hem waste body, and state; and after all, \n
When their owne Parasites laugh at their fall, \n
May they have nothing left, whereof they can \n
Boast, but how oft they have gone wrong to man: \n
And call it their brave sinne. For such there be \n
That doe sinne onely for the infamie: \n
And never think, how vice doth every houre, \n
Eat on her clients, and some one devoure. \n
You, Madam, yong have learn'd to shun these shelves, \n
Whereon the most of mankind wracke themselves, \n
And, keeping a just course, have early put \n
Into your harbour, and all passage shut \n
'Gainst stormes, or pyrats, that might charge your peace; \n
For which you worthy are the glad increase \n
Of your blest wombe, made fruitfull from above \n
To pay your lord the pledges of chaste love: \n
And raise a noble stemme, to give the fame, \n
To Cliftons blood, that is deny'd their name. \n
Grow, grow, faire tree, and as thy branches shoote, \n
Heare, what the Muses sing above thy root, \n
By me, their Priest (if they can ought divine) \n
Before the moones have fill'd their tripple trine, \n
To crowne the burthen which you go withall, \n
It shall a ripe and timely issue fall, \n
T'expect the honors of great 'Avbigny: \n
And greater rites, yet writ in mystery, \n
But which the Fates forbid me to reveale. \n
Only, thus much, out of a ravish'd zeale, \n
Unto your name, and goodnesse of your life, \n
They speake; since you are truly that rare wife, \n
Other great wives may blush at: when they see \n
What your try'd manners are, what theirs should be. \n
How you love one, and him you should; how still \n
You are depending on his word, and will; \n
Not fashion'd for the Court, or strangers eyes; \n
But to prease him, who is the dearer prise \n
Unto himselfe, by being so deare to you. \n
This makes, that your affections still be new, \n
And that your soules conspire, as they were gone \n
Each into other, and had now made one. \n
Live that one, still; and as long yeares do passe, \n
Madame, be bold to use this truest glasse: \n
Wherein, your forme, you still the same shall find; \n
Because nor it can change, nor such a mind. \n<|endoftext|>
epistle \n
How happy you! who varied joys pursue; \n
And every hour presents you something new! \n
Plans, schemes, and models, all Palladio's art, \n
For six long months have gain'd upon your heart; \n
Of collonades, of corridors you talk, \n
The winding staircase and the cover'd walk; \n
You blend the orders with Vitruvian toil, \n
And raise with wond'rous joy the fancy'd pile: \n
But the dull workman's slow-performing hand \n
But coldly executes his lord's command. \n
With dirt and mortar soon you grow displeas'd, \n
Planting succeeds, and avenues are rais'd, \n
Canals are cut, and mountains level made, \n
Bow'rs of retreat, and galleries of shade; \n
The shaven turf presents a lively green; \n
The bordering flowers in mystic knots are seen: \n
With studied art on nature you refine -- \n
The spring beheld you warm in this design, \n
But scarce the cold attacks your fav'rite trees, \n
Your inclination fails, and wishes freeze: \n
You quit the grove so lately you admir'd; \n
With other views your eager hopes are fir'd; \n
Post to the city you direct your way; \n
Not blooming paradise could bribe your stay: \n
Ambition shows you power's brightest side, \n
'Tis meanly poor in solitude to hide: \n
Though certain pains attend the cares of state, \n
A good man owes his country to be great; \n
Should act abroad the high distinguish'd part, \n
Or show at least the purpose of his heart. \n
With thoughts like these the shining courts you seek, \n
Full of new projects for almost a week; \n
You then despise the tinsel-glittering snare, \n
Think vile mankind below a serious care. \n
Life is too short for any distant aim; \n
And cold the dull reward of future fame: \n
Be happy then, while yet you have to live; \n
And love is all the blessing Heav'n can give. \n
Fir'd by new passion you address the fair, \n
Survey the opera as a gay parterre; \n
Young Chloe's bloom had made you certain prize, \n
But for a sidelong glance from Celia's eyes: \n
Your beating heart acknowledges her pow'r; \n
Your eager eyes her lovely form devour; \n
You feel the poison swelling in your breast, \n
And all your soul by fond desire possess'd. \n
In dying sighs a long three hours are past; \n
To some assembly with impatient haste, \n
With trembling hope, and doubtful fear, you move, \n
Resolv'd to tempt your fate, and own your love: \n
But there Belinda meets you on the stairs, \n
Easy her shape, attracting all her airs; \n
A smile she gives, and with a smile can wound; \n
Her melting voice hath music in the sound; \n
Her every motion wears resistless grace; \n
Wit in her mien, and pleasure in her face: \n
Here while you vow eternity of love, \n
Chloe and Celia unregarded move. \n
Thus on the sands of Afric's burning plains, \n
However deeply made, no long impress remains; \n
The slightest leaf can leave its figure there; \n
The strongest form is scatter'd by the air. \n
So yielding the warm temper of your mind, \n
So touch'd by every eye, so toss'd by wind; \n
Oh! how unlike the Heav'n my soul design'd! \n
Unseen, unheard, the throng around me move; \n
Not wishing praise, insensible of love; \n
No whispers soften, nor no beauties fire; \n
Careless I see the dance, and coldly hear the lyre. \n
So num'rous herds are driv'n o'er the rock; \n
No print is left of all the passing flock: \n
So sings the wind around the solid stone; \n
So vainly beat the waves with fruitless moan. \n
Tedious the toil, and great the workman's care, \n
Who dare attempt to fix impressions there: \n
But should some swain, more skilful than the rest, \n
Engrave his name upon this marble breast, \n
Not rolling ages could deface that name; \n
Through all the storms of life 'tis still the same: \n
Though length of years with moss may shade the ground, \n
Deep, though unseen, remains the secret wound. \n<|endoftext|>
epistle \n
I who was once as great as Caesar, \n
Am now reduc'd to Nebuchadnezzar; \n
And from as fam'd a conqueror \n
As ever took degree in war, \n
Or did his exercise in battle, \n
By you turn'd out to grass with cattle: \n
For since I am deny'd access \n
To all my earthly happiness \n
Am fallen from the paradise \n
Of your good graces, and fair eyes; \n
Lost to the world, and you, I'm sent \n
To everlasting banishment; \n
Where all the hopes I had t' have won \n
Your heart, b'ing dash'd, will break my own. \n
Yet if you were not so severe \n
To pass your doom before you hear, \n
You'd find, upon my just defence, \n
How much y' have wrong'd my innocence. \n
That once I made a vow to you, \n
Which yet is unperformed, 'tis true: \n
But not because it is unpaid, \n
'Tis violated, though delay'd; \n
Or, if it were, it is no fau't, \n
So heinous as you'd have it thought; \n
To undergo the loss of ears, \n
Like vulgar hackney perjurers \n
For there's a diff'rence in the case, \n
Between the noble and the base, \n
Who always are observ'd t' have done't \n
Upon as different an account: \n
The one for great and weighty cause, \n
To salve in honour ugly flaws; \n
For none are like to do it sooner \n
Than those who are nicest of their honour: \n
The other, for base gain and pay, \n
Forswear, and perjure by the day; \n
And make th' exposing and retailing \n
Their souls and consciences a calling. \n
It is no scandal, nor aspersion, \n
Upon a great and noble person, \n
To say he nat'rally abhorr'd \n
Th' old-fashion'd trick, To keep his word; \n
Though 'tis perfidiousness and shame \n
In meaner men to do the same: \n
For to be able to forget, \n
Is found more useful to the great, \n
Than gout, or deafness, or bad eyes, \n
To make 'em pass for wond'rous wise. \n
But though the law on perjurers \n
Inflicts the forfeiture of ears, \n
It is not just that does exempt \n
The guilty, and punish th' innocent; \n
To make the ears repair the wrong \n
Committed by th' ungovern'd tongue; \n
And when one member is forsworn, \n
Another to be cropt or torn. \n
And if you shou'd, as you design, \n
By course of law, recover mine, \n
You're like, if you consider right, \n
To gain but little honour by't. \n
For he that for his lady's sake \n
Lays down his life or limbs at stake, \n
Does not so much deserve her favour, \n
As he that pawns his soul to have her, \n
This y' have acknowledg'd I have done, \n
Although you now disdain to own; \n
But sentence what you rather ought \n
T' esteem good service than a fau't. \n
Besides, oaths are not bound to bear \n
That literal sense the words infer, \n
But, by the practice of the age, \n
Are to be judg'd how far th' engage; \n
And, where the sense by custom's checkt, \n
Are found void, and of none effect. \n
For no man takes or keeps a vow \n
But just as he sees others do; \n
Nor are th' oblig'd to be so brittle, \n
As not to yield and bow a little: \n
For as best-temper'd blades are found, \n
Before they break, to bend quite round, \n
So truest oaths are still most tough, \n
And though they bow, are breaking proof. \n
Then wherefore should they not b' allow'd \n
In love a greater latitude? \n
For as the law of arms approves \n
All ways to conquest, so should love's; \n
And not be ty'd to true or false, \n
But make that justest that prevails \n
For how can that which is above \n
All empire, high and mighty love, \n
Submit its great prerogative \n
To any other power alive? \n
Shall love, that to no crown gives place, \n
Become the subject of a case? \n
The fundamental law of nature, \n
Be over-rul'd by those made after? \n
Commit the censure of its cause \n
To any but its own great laws? \n
Love, that's the world's preservative, \n
That keeps all souls of things alive; \n
Controuls the mighty pow'r of fate, \n
And gives mankind a longer date; \n
The life of nature, that restores \n
As fast as time and death devours; \n
To whose free-gift the world does owe, \n
Not only earth, but heaven too; \n
For love's the only trade that's driven, \n
The interest of state in heav'n, \n
Which nothing but the soul of man \n
Is capable to entertain. \n
For what can earth produce, but love \n
To represent the joys above? \n
Or who but lovers can converse, \n
Like angels, by e the eye-discourse? \n
Address and compliment by vision; \n
Make love and court by intuition? \n
And burn in amorous flames as fierce \n
As those celestial ministers? \n
Then how can any thing offend, \n
In order to so great an end? \n
Or heav'n itself a sin f resent, \n
That for its own supply was meant? \n
That merits, in a kind mistake, \n
A pardon for th' offence's sake. \n
Or if it did not, but the cause \n
Were left to th' injury at laws, \n
What tyranny can disapprove \n
There should be equity in love; \n
For laws that are inanimate, \n
And feel no sense of love or hate, \n
That have no passion of their own, \n
Nor pity to be wrought upon, \n
Are only proper to inflict \n
Revenge on criminals as strict \n
But to have power to forgive, \n
Is empire and prerogative; \n
And 'tis in crowns a nobler gem \n
To grant a pardon than condemn. \n
Then since so few do what they ought, \n
'Tis great t' indulge a well-meant fau't. \n
For why should he who made address, \n
All humble ways, without success, \n
And met with nothing, in return, \n
But insolence, affronts, and scorn, \n
Not strive by wit to countermine, \n
And bravely carry his design? \n
He who was us'd so unlike a soldier, \n
Blown up with philters of love-powder? \n
And after letting blood, and purging, \n
Condemn'd to voluntary scourging; \n
Alarm'd with many a horrid fright, \n
And claw'd by goblins in the night; \n
Insulted on, revil'd, and jeer'd, \n
With rude invasion of his beard; \n
And when your sex was foully scandal'd, \n
As foully by the rabble handled; \n
Attack'd by despicable foes, \n
And drub'd with mean and vulgar blows; \n
And, after all, to be debarr'd \n
So much as standing on his guard; \n
When horses, being spurr'd and prick'd, \n
Have leave to kick for being kick'd? \n
Or why should you, whose mother-wits \n
Are furnish'd with all perquisites, \n
That with your breeding-teeth begin, \n
And nursing babies, that lie in, \n
B' allow'd to put all tricks upon \n
Our cully sex, and we use none? \n
We, who have nothing but frail vows \n
Against your stratagems t' oppose; \n
Or oaths more feeble than your own, \n
By which we are no less put down? \n
You wound, like g Parthians, while you fly, \n
And kill with a retreating eye: \n
Retire the more, the more we press \n
To draw us into ambushes. \n
As pirates all false colours wear \n
T' intrap th' unwary mariner, \n
So women, to surprise us, spread \n
The borrow'd flags of white and red; \n
Display 'em thicker on their cheeks \n
Than their old grandmothers, the Picts; \n
And raise more devils with their looks, \n
Than conjurer's less subtle books; \n
Lay trains of amorous intrigues, \n
In tow'rs, and curls, and perriwigs, \n
With greater art and cunning rear'd, \n
Than h PHILIP NYE's thanksgiving beard, \n
Prepost'rously t' entice, and gain \n
Those to adore 'em they disdain; \n
And only draw 'em in, to clog \n
With idle names a catalogue. \n
A lover is, the more he's brave, \n
T' his mistress but the more a slave; \n
And whatsoever she commands, \n
Becomes a favour from her hands; \n
Which he's obliged t' obey, and must, \n
Whether it be unjust or just. \n
Then when he is compell'd by her \n
T' adventures he would else forbear, \n
Who with his honour can withstand, \n
Since force is greater than command? \n
And when necessity's obey'd, \n
Nothing can be unjust or bad \n
And therefore when the mighty pow'rs \n
Of love, our great ally and yours, \n
Join'd forces not to be withstood \n
By frail enamour'd flesh and blood, \n
All I have done, unjust or ill, \n
Was in obedience to your will; \n
And all the blame that can be due, \n
Falls to your cruelty and you. \n
Nor are those scandals I confest, \n
Against my will and interest, \n
More than is daily done of course \n
By all men, when they're under force; \n
When some upon the rack confess \n
What th' hangman and their prompters please; \n
But are no sooner out of pain, \n
Than they deny it all again. \n
But when the Devil turns confessor, \n
Truth is a crime he takes no pleasure \n
To hear, or pardon, like the founder \n
Of liars, whom they all claim under \n
And therefore, when I told him none, \n
I think it was the wiser done. \n
Nor am I without precedent, \n
The first that on th' adventure went \n
All mankind ever did of course, \n
And daily dues the same, or worse. \n
For what romance can show a lover, \n
That had a lady to recover, \n
And did not steer a nearer course, \n
To fall a-board on his amours? \n
And what at first was held a crime, \n
Has turn'd to honourable in time. \n
To what a height did i infant ROME, \n
By ravishing of women, come \n
When men upon their spouses seiz'd, \n
And freely marry'd where they pleas'd, \n
They ne'er forswore themselves, nor ly'd. \n
Nor, in the mind they were in, dy'd; \n
Nor took the pains t' address and sue, \n
Nor play'd the masquerade to woo; \n
Disdain'd to stay for friends' consents; \n
Nor juggled about settlements: \n
Did need no license, nor no priest, \n
Nor friends, nor kindred, to assist; \n
Nor lawyers, to join land and money \n
In th' holy state of matrimony, \n
Before they settled hands and hearts, \n
Till k alimony or death them parts: \n
Nor wou'd endure to stay until \n
Th' had got the very bride's good will; \n
But took a wise and shorter course \n
To win the ladies, downright force. \n
And justly made 'em prisoners then, \n
As they have often since, us men, \n
With acting plays, and dancing jigs, \n
The luckiest of all love's intrigues; \n
And when they had them at their pleasure, \n
Then talk'd of love and flames at leisure; \n
For after matrimony's over, \n
He that holds out but half a lover, \n
Deserves for ev'ry minute more \n
Than half a year of love before; \n
For which the dames in contemplation \n
Of that best way of application, \n
Prov'd nobler wives than e'er was known, \n
By suit or treaty to be won; \n
And such as all posterity \n
Cou'd never equal nor come nigh. \n
For women first were made for men, \n
Not men for them. - It follows, then, \n
That men have right to ev'ry one, \n
And they no freedom of their own \n
And therefore men have pow'r to chuse, \n
But they no charter to refuse. \n
Hence 'tis apparent, that what course \n
Soe'er we take to your amours, \n
Though by the indirectest way, \n
'Tis no injustice, nor foul play; \n
And that you ought to take that course, \n
As we take you, for better or worse; \n
And gratefully submit to those \n
Who you, before another, chose. \n
For why should ev'ry savage beast \n
Exceed his great lord's interest? \n
Have freer pow'r than he in grace, \n
And nature, o'er the creature has? \n
Because the laws he since has made \n
Have cut off all the pow'r he had; \n
Retrench'd the absolute dominion \n
That nature gave him over women; \n
When all his pow'r will not extend \n
One law of nature to suspend; \n
And but to offer to repeal \n
The smallest clause, is to rebel. \n
This, if men rightly understood \n
Their privilege, they wou'd make good; \n
And not, like sots, permit their wives \n
T' encroach on their prerogatives; \n
For which sin they deserve to be \n
Kept, as they are, in slavery: \n
And this some precious Gifted Teachers, \n
Unrev'rently reputed leachers, \n
And disobey'd in making love, \n
Have vow'd to all the world to prove, \n
And make ye suffer, as you ought, \n
For that uncharitable fau't. \n
But I forget myself, and rove \n
Beyond th' instructions of my love. \n
Forgive me (Fair) and only blame \n
Th' extravagancy of my flame, \n
Since 'tis too much at once to show \n
Excess of love and temper too. \n
All I have said that's bad and true, \n
Was never meant to aim at you, \n
Who have so sov'reign a controul \n
O'er that poor slave of yours, my soul, \n
That, rather than to forfeit you, \n
Has ventur'd loss of heaven too: \n
Both with an equal pow'r possest, \n
To render all that serve you blest: \n
But none like him, who's destin'd either \n
To have, or lose you, both together. \n
And if you'll but this fault release \n
(For so it must be, since you please) \n
I'll pay down all that vow, and more, \n
Which you commanded, and I swore, \n
And expiate upon my skin \n
Th' arrears in full of all my sin. \n
For 'tis but just that I should pay \n
Th' accruing penance for delay, \n
Which shall be done, until it move \n
Your equal pity and your love. \n
The Knight, perusing this Epistle, \n
Believ'd h' had brought her to his whistle; \n
And read it like a jocund lover, \n
With great applause t' himself, twice over; \n
Subscrib'd his name, but at a fit \n
And humble distance to his wit; \n
And dated it with wond'rous art, \n
Giv'n from the bottom of his heart; \n
Then seal'd it with his Coat of Love, \n
A smoaking faggot - and above, \n
Upon a scroll - I burn, and weep; \n
And near it - For her Ladyship; \n
Of all her sex most excellent, \n
These to her gentle hands present. \n
Then gave it to his faithful Squire, \n
With lessons how t' observe and eye her. \n
She first consider'd which was better, \n
To send it back, or burn the letter. \n
But guessing that it might import, \n
Though nothing else, at least her sport, \n
She open'd it, and read it out, \n
With many a smile and leering flout: \n
Resolv'd to answer it in kind, \n
And thus perform'd what she design'd. \n<|endoftext|>
epistle \n
ON THE REJECTION OF THE BILL FOR ABOLISHING THE SLAVE TRADE, 1791. \n
Cease, Wilberforce, to urge thy generous aim! \n
Thy Country knows the sin, and stands the shame! \n
The Preacher, Poet, Senator in vain \n
Has rattled in her sight the Negro's chain; \n
With his deep groans assailed her startled ear, \n
And rent the veil that hid his constant tear; \n
Forced her averted eyes his stripes to scan, \n
Beneath the bloody scourge laid bare the man, \n
Claimed Pity's tear, urged Conscience' strong controul, \n
And flashed conviction on her shrinking soul. \n
The Muse too, soon awaked, with ready tongue \n
At Mercy's shrine applausive pæans rung; \n
And Freedom's eager sons in vain foretold \n
A new Astrean reign, an age of gold: \n
She knows and she persists—Still Afric bleeds, \n
Unchecked, the human traffic still proceeds; \n
She stamps her infamy to future time, \n
And on her hardened forehead seals the crime. \n
In vain, to thy white standard gathering round, \n
Wit, Worth, and Parts and Eloquence are found: \n
In vain, to push to birth thy great design, \n
Contending chiefs, and hostile virtues join; \n
All, from conflicting ranks, of power possesst \n
To rouse, to melt, or to inform the breast. \n
Where seasoned tools of Avarice prevail, \n
A Nation's eloquence, combined, must fail: \n
Each flimsy sophistry by turns they try; \n
The plausive argument, the daring lie, \n
The artful gloss, that moral sense confounds, \n
The' acknowledged thirst of gain that honour wounds: \n
Bane of ingenuous minds!—the' unfeeling sneer, \n
Which sudden turns to stone the falling tear: \n
They search assiduous, with inverted skill, \n
For forms of wrong, and precedents of ill; \n
With impious mockery wrest the sacred page, \n
And glean up crimes from each remoter age: \n
Wrung Nature's tortures, shuddering, while you tell, \n
From scoffing fiends bursts forth the laugh of hell; \n
In Britain's senate, Misery's pangs give birth \n
To jests unseemly, and to horrid mirth— \n
Forbear!—thy virtues but provoke our doom, \n
And swell the' account of vengeance yet to come; \n
For, not unmarked in Heaven's impartial plan, \n
Shall man, proud worm, contemn his fellow-man! \n
And injured Afric, by herself redresst, \n
Darts her own serpents at her tyrant's breast. \n
Each vice, to minds depraved by bondage known, \n
With sure contagion fastens on his own; \n
In sickly languors melts his nerveless frame, \n
And blows to rage impetuous Passion's flame: \n
Fermenting swift, the fiery venom gains \n
The milky innocence of infant veins; \n
There swells the stubborn will, damps learning's fire, \n
The whirlwind wakes of uncontrouled desire, \n
Sears the young heart to images of woe, \n
And blasts the buds of Virtue as they blow. \n
Lo! where reclined, pale Beauty courts the breeze, \n
Diffused on sofas of voluptuous ease; \n
With anxious awe her menial train around \n
Catch her faint whispers of half-uttered sound; \n
See her, in monstrous fellowship, unite \n
At once the Scythian and the Sybarite! \n
Blending repugnant vices, misallied, \n
Which frugal nature purposed to divide; \n
See her, with indolence to fierceness joined, \n
Of body delicate, infirm of mind, \n
With languid tones imperious mandates urge; \n
With arm recumbent wield the household scourge; \n
And with unruffled mien, and placid sounds, \n
Contriving torture, and inflicting wounds. \n
Nor, in their palmy walks and spicy groves, \n
The form benign of rural Pleasure roves; \n
No milk-maid's song, or hum of village talk, \n
Soothes the lone poet in his evening walk: \n
No willing arm the flail unwearied plies, \n
Where the mixed sounds of cheerful labour rise; \n
No blooming maids and frolic swains are seen \n
To pay gay homage to their harvest queen: \n
No heart-expanding scenes their eyes must prove \n
Of thriving industry and faithful love: \n
But shrieks and yells disturb the balmy air, \n
Dumb sullen looks of woe announce despair, \n
And angry eyes through dusky features glare. \n
Far from the sounding lash the Muses fly, \n
And sensual riot drowns each finer joy. \n
Nor less from the gay East, on essenced wings, \n
Breathing unnamed perfumes, Contagion springs; \n
The soft luxurious plague alike pervades \n
The marble palaces and rural shades; \n
Hence thronged Augusta builds her rosy bowers, \n
And decks in summer wreaths her smoky towers; \n
And hence, in summer bowers, Art's costly hand \n
Pours courtly splendours o'er the dazzled land: \n
The manners melt;—one undistinguished blaze \n
O'erwhelms the sober pomp of elder days; \n
Corruption follows with gigantic stride, \n
And scarce vouchsafes his shameless front to hide: \n
The spreading leprosy taints every part, \n
Infects each limb, and sickens at the heart. \n
Simplicity, most dear of rural maids, \n
Weeping resigns her violated shades: \n
Stern Independence from his glebe retires, \n
And anxious Freedom eyes her drooping fires; \n
By foreign wealth are British morals changed, \n
And Afric's sons, and India's, smile avenged. \n
For you, whose tempered ardour long has borne \n
Untired the labour, and unmoved the scorn; \n
In Virtue's fasti be inscribed your fame, \n
And uttered yours with Howard's honoured name; \n
Friends of the friendless—Hail, ye generous band! \n
Whose efforts yet arrest Heaven's lifted hand, \n
Around whose steady brows, in union bright, \n
The civic wreath and Christian's palm unite: \n
Your merit stands, no greater and no less, \n
Without, or with the varnish of success: \n
But seek no more to break a nation's fall, \n
For ye have saved yourselves—and that is all. \n
Succeeding times your struggles, and their fate, \n
With mingled shame and triumph shall relate; \n
While faithful History, in her various page, \n
Marking the features of this motley age, \n
To shed a glory, and to fix a stain, \n
Tells how you strove, and that you strove in vain. \n<|endoftext|>

You are a doctor now - I've heard \n
A colourful glass jar \n
Your figure \n
With a dedicative label \n
Of service to the sick and the suffering. \n
I've heard \n
Your dreams have come true \n
The waning, waxing moons \n
Of quaint wishes \n
We saw together \n
Have blossomed to fullness. \n
Away and beyond \n
In lands overseas \n
All chapters of your book \n
Of youthful ambitions \n
Have come to be written. \n
I've heard \n
You have got all you ever \n
Wished for, desired. \n
All ideals realized. \n
A higher academic degree \n
Fame, renown and status \n
A pretty home \n
A loving husband - and children! \n
Salutations \n
Best wishes \n
For all th' laurels won \n
All that you've done. \n
But O my Messiah \n
Of long-forgotton woes! \n
Did you ever give \n
A backward glance? \n
The time-worn memory album \n
Was always there to see \n
Faces, friendly and faithful \n
Dust-laden though \n
In the pledges of everlasting rememberance. \n
What lenses \n
Of remorse \n
Will ever reveal visages of past? \n
How'll you ever \n
Bridge the empty spaces \n
Rolling from dreams \n
To eyes - and beyond? \n
How'll you ever \n
Put soothing balm \n
On your self-afflicted wounds? \n<|endoftext|>
epistle \n
In vain, dear Madam, yes in vain you strive; \n
Alas! to make your luckless Mira thrive, \n
For Tycho and Copernicus agree, \n
No golden Planet bent its Rays on me. \n
'Tis twenty Winters, if it is no more; \n
To speak the Truth it may be Twenty four. \n
As many Springs their 'pointed Space have run, \n
Since Mira's Eyes first open'd on the Sun. \n
'Twas when the Flocks on slabby Hillocks lie, \n
And the cold Fishes rule the wat'ry Sky: \n
But tho these Eyes the learned Page explore, \n
And turn the pond'rous Volumes o'er and o'er, \n
I find no Comfort from their Systems flow, \n
But am dejected more as more I know. \n
Hope shines a while, but like a Vapour flies, \n
(The Fate of all the Curious and the Wise) \n
For, Ah! cold Saturn triumph'd on that Day, \n
And frowning Sol deny'd his golden Ray. \n
You see I'm learned, and I shew't the more, \n
That none may wonder when they find me poor. \n
Yet Mira dreams, as slumbring Poets may, \n
And rolls in Treasures till the breaking Day: \n
While Books and Pictures in bright Order rise, \n
And painted Parlours swim before her Eyes: \n
Till the shrill Clock impertinently rings, \n
And the soft Visions move their shining Wings: \n
Then Mira wakes,-- her Pictures are no more, \n
And through her Fingers slides the vanish'd Ore. \n
Convinc'd too soon, her Eye unwilling falls \n
On the blue Curtains and the dusty Walls: \n
She wakes, alas! to Business and to Woes, \n
To sweep her Kitchen, and to mend her Clothes. \n
But see pale Sickness with her languid Eyes, \n
At whose Appearance all Delusion flies: \n
The World recedes, its Vanities decline, \n
Clorinda's Features seem as faint as mine! \n
Gay Robes no more the aching Sight admires, \n
Wit grates the Ear, and melting Music tires: \n
Its wonted pleasures with each sense decay, \n
Books please no more, and paintings fade away, \n
The sliding Joys in misty Vapours end: \n
Yet let me still, Ah! let me grasp a Friend: \n
And when each Joy, when each lov'd Object flies, \n
Be you the last that leaves my closing Eyes. \n
But how will this dismantl'd Soul appear, \n
When stripp'd of all it lately held so dear, \n
Forc'd from its Prison of expiring Clay, \n
Afraid and shiv'ring at the doubtful Way. \n
Yet did these Eyes a dying Parent see, \n
Loos'd from all Cares except a Thought for me, \n
Without a Tear resign her short'ning Breath, \n
And dauntless meet the ling'ring Stroke of Death. \n
Then at th' Almighty's Sentence shall I mourn: \n
"Of Dust thou art, to Dust shalt thou return." \n
Or shall I wish to stretch the Line of Fate, \n
That the dull Years may bear a longer Date, \n
To share the Follies of succeeding Times \n
With more Vexations and with deeper Crimes: \n
Ah no -- tho' Heav'n brings near the final Day, \n
For such a Life I will not, dare not pray; \n
But let the Tear for future Mercy flow, \n
And fall resign'd beneath the mighty Blow. \n
Nor I alone -- for through the spacious Ball, \n
With me will Numbers of all Ages fall: \n
And the same Day that Mira yields her Breath, \n
Thousands may enter through the Gates of Death. \n<|endoftext|>
epistle \n
Dear friend, when we met near the olive fields \n
So beautiful like sable pearls hanging from their \n
branch, I had been returning to the great \n
House. These olives are a treasure to taste, \n
I stole one into my mouth after paying \n
Homage in my heart to the Lord. Remnants. \n
From where you came is a mystery. I \n
Beheld you for the first time, I knew I \n
Would love you. The stars came with blinking stares. \n
As our conversation past into night, \n
I found that this had been the best day since \n
Yesterday. Where before I did not know \n
How much wonderful fun you could truly \n
Be. Now I feel duty bound by affection. \n
Your eyes are like the olives. Today we \n
Shall meet again, after I pay homage \n
To the Lord of my heart. After all, He \n
Made the bough from where your eyes \n
Remind me: olives make wine. I do not \n
Drink, so please do not presume I will do. \n
The wind is a light caress tonight, as \n
I close my eyes I feel I share with you. \n
I breath in the air, as I think privately. \n
My environment seems exquisite, \n
As I look forward to taking a walk \n
By the treasures. Until we meet again, \n
Should the Maker of your eyes allow it. \n
Your affectionate friend, Serah Rosary. \n<|endoftext|>
epistle \n
DEAR COSMOPOLITAN,—I know \n
I should address you a Rondeau, \n
Or else announce what I ’ve to say \n
At least en Ballade fratriseé \n
But No: for once I leave Gymnasticks, \n
And take to simple Hudibrasticks, \n
Why should I choose another Way, \n
When this was good enough for GAY? \n
You love, my FRIEND, with me I think, \n
That Age of Lustre and of Link; \n
Of Chelsea China and long “s”es, \n
Of Bag-wigs and of flowered Dresses; \n
That Age of Folly and of Cards, \n
Of Hackney Chairs and Hackney Bards; \n
—No H-LTS, no K-G-N P-LS were then \n
Dispensing Competence to Men; \n
The gentle Trade was left to Churls, \n
Your frowsy TONSONS and your CURLLS; \n
Mere Wolves in Ambush to attack \n
The AUTHOR in a Sheep-skin Back; \n
Then SAVAGE and his Brother-Sinners \n
In Porridge Island div’d for Dinners; \n
Or doz’d on Covent Garden Bulks, \n
And liken’d Letters to the Hulks;— \n
You know that by-gone Time, I say, \n
That aimless easy-moral’d Day, \n
When rosy Morn found MADAM still \n
Wrangling at Ombre or Quadrille, \n
When good SIR JOHN reel’d Home to Bed, \n
From Pontack’s or the Shakespeare's’s Head; \n
When TRIP convey’d his Master’s Cloaths, \n
And took his Titles and his Oaths; \n
While BETTY, in a cast Brocade, \n
Ogled MY LORD at Masquerade; \n
When GARRICK play’d the guilty Richard, \n
Or mouth’d Macbeth with Mrs. PRITCHARD; \n
When FOOTE grimaced his snarling Wit; \n
When CHURCHILL bullied in the Pit; \n
When the CUZZONI sang— \n
But there! \n
The further Catalogue I spare, \n
Having no Purpose to eclipse \n
That tedious Tale of HOMER’S Ships;— \n
This is the MAN that drew it all \n
From Pannier Alley to the Mall, \n
Then turn’d and drew it once again \n
From Bird-Cage-Walk to Lewknor’s Lane;— \n
Its Rakes and Fools, its Rogues and Sots; \n
Its brawling Quacks, its starveling Scots; \n
Its Ups and Downs, its Rags and Garters, \n
Its HENLEYS, LOVATS, MALCOLMS, CHARTRES, \n
Its Splendor, Squalor, Shame, Disease; \n
Its quicquid agunt Homines;— \n
Nor yet omitted to pourtray \n
Furens quid possit Foemina;— \n
In short, held up to ev’ry Class \n
NATURE’S unflatt’ring looking-Glass; \n
And, from his Canvas, spoke to All \n
The Message of a JUVENAL. \n
Take Him. His Merits most aver: \n

epistle \n
In the embryonic phases a molecular constitution amorphously \n
spirals in a nebulous state reminiscent of the origins of our universe. \n
Within this mystical mixture we conjure recipes most cautiously \n
to resemble the inventive process of visionary connoisseurs. \n
Generating a rhythmical contagiousness to raise the equivalence \n
of tonal and visual impressions to unify and consciously coincide. \n
Mirroring this reflective image the artist exhibits an inborn sense \n
of transmutation elaborating thematic substance so profoundly bona fide. \n
Sensitive interpretations are crawling under the skin to reappear in succulence \n
overflowing with impassioned undertones to resurrect our ancestors. \n
Overjoyed with the gift of life the ragamuffins plea to their benefactors \n
for the acquisition of expedience as each individual excels quite beauteously. \n
Entering into an era of perpetually resounding adoration the urchins confide \n
in a suggestive novelty implying constancy and accentuating their competence. \n
Their naturalism evokes a vivacity which pervades the prognosis of doom \n
to glimmer with ricocheting lightning reenacting the inculpable orators. \n
Initiating a sermon of an innocuous nature the benign and receptive auditors \n
will captivate, in protocol, the cultivated phraseology as naught will be assumed. \n
Reaching upward to grasp the eternal foresight we challenge our capability \n
to alleviate our dilemmas and chaperon us to self-belief and a newly-found confidence. \n
Ostracizing the subjective criticism we exercise articulate forms of agility \n
to rebound against jealousness with a perception of clarity and diminishing gloom. \n
With a bouquet of forgiveness filled with reconciliation we walk tall conspicuously \n
in a ray of sunshine grinning through the madness like a boundless adventurer. \n
Equally as pleased with an attitude of complacency we magnetize the community \n
to follow like children the Pied Piper with a freewheeling laissez-faire, intense \n
not irresponsible, eluding the stress of the untactful and suppressive proprietors. \n
Unapproachable aloofness is in no fashion a substitute for openheartedness with sincerity \n
to bring a healing force to our battered world where to endow our neighbor is abundance. \n<|endoftext|>

I am nae poet, in a sense, \n
But just a rhymer like by chance, \n
An' hae to learning nae pretence; \n

Your critic-folk may cock their nose, \n

epistle \n
Most of the things you made for me—blanket- \n
chest, lapdesk, the armless rocker—I gave \n
away to friends who could use them and not \n
be reminded of the hours lost there, \n
not having been witness to those designs, \n
the tedious finishes. But I did keep \n
the mirror, perhaps because like all mirrors, \n
most of these years it has been invisible, \n
part of the wall, or defined by reflection— \n
safe—because reflection, after all, does change. \n
I hung it here in the front, dark hallway \n
of this house you will never see, so that \n
it might magnify the meager light, \n
become a lesser, backward window. No one \n
pauses long before it. But this morning, \n
as I put on my overcoat, then straightened \n
my hair, I saw outside my face its frame \n
you made for me, admiring for the first \n
time the way the cherry you cut and planed \n
yourself had darkened, just as you said it would. \n<|endoftext|>
epistle \n
I. \n
My sister! my sweet sister! if a name \n
Dearer and purer were, it should be thine; \n
Mountains and seas divide us, but I claim \n
No tears, but tenderness to answer mine: \n
Go where I will, to me thou art the same­ \n
A loved regret which I would not resign, \n
There yet are two things in my des­tiny, - \n
A world to roam through, and a home with thee. \n
II. \n
The first were nothing-had I still the last, \n
It were the haven of my happiness; \n
But other claims and other ties thou hast, \n
And mine is not the wish to make them less. \n
A strange doom is thy father's son's, and past \n
Recalling, as it lies beyond redress; \n
Reversed for him our grandsire's fate of yore, \n
He had no rest at sea, nor I on shore. \n
III. \n
If my inheritance of storms hath been \n
In other elements, and on the rocks \n
Of perils, overlook'd or unforeseen, \n
I have sustain'd my share of worldly shocks, \n
The fault was mine; nor do I seek to screen \n
My errors with defensive paradox; \n
I have been cunning in mine overthrow, \n
The careful pilot of my proper woe. \n
IV. \n
Mine were my faults, and mine be their reward. \n
My whole life was a contest, since the day \n
That gave me being, gave me that which marr'd \n
The gift,- a fate, or will, that walk'd astray; \n
And I at times have found the struggle hard, \n
And thought of shaking off my bonds of clay: \n
But now I fain would for a time survive, \n
If but to see what next can well arrive. \n
V. \n
Kingdoms and empires in my little day \n
I have outlived, and yet I am not old; \n
And when I look on this, the petty spray \n
Of my own years of trouble, which have roll'd \n
Like a wild bay of breakers, melts away \n
Something-I know not what-does still uphold \n
A spirit of slight patience; not in vain, \n
Even for its own sake, do we purchase pain. \n
VI. \n
Perhaps the workings of defiance stir \n
Within me - or perhaps a cold despair, \n
Brought on when ills habitually recur, \n
Perhaps a kinder clime, or purer air, \n
(For even to this may change of soul refer, \n
And with light armour we may learn to bear,) \n
Have taught me a strange quiet, which was not \n
The chief companion of a calmer lot. \n
VII. \n
I feel almost at times as I have felt \n
In happy childhood; trees, and flowers, and brooks, \n
Which do remember me of where I dwelt \n
Ere my young mind was sacrificed to books, \n
Come as of yore upon me, and can melt \n
My heart with recognition of their looks; \n
And even at moments I could think I see \n
Some living thing to love-but none like thee. \n
VIII. \n
Here are the Alpine landscapes which create \n
A fund for contemplation;- to admire \n
Is a brief feeling of a trivial date; \n
But something worthier do such scenes inspire: \n
Here to be lonely is not desolate' \n
For much I view which I could most desire, \n
And, above all, a lake I can behold \n
Lovelier, not dearer, than our own of old. \n
IX. \n
Oh that thou wert but with me! - but I grow \n
The fool of my own wishes, and forget \n
The solitude which I have vaunted so \n
Has lost its praise in this but one regret; \n
There may be others which I less may show \n
I am not of the plaintive mood, and yet \n
I feel an ebb in my philosophy, \n
And the tide rising in my alter'd eye. \n
X. \n
I did remind thee of our own dear Lake, \n
By the old Hall which may be mine no more. \n
Leman's is fair; but think not I forsake \n
The sweet remembrance of a dearer shore: \n
Sad havoc Time must with my memory make, \n
Ere that or thou can fade these eyes before; \n
Though, like all things which I have loved they are \n
Resign 'd For ever, or divided far. \n
XI. \n
The world is all before me; I but ask \n
Of Nature that with which she will comply \n
It is but in her summer's sun to bask, \n
To mingle with the quiet of her sky, \n
To see her gentle face without a mask, \n
And never gaze on it with apathy. \n
She was my early friend, and now shall be \n
My sister - till I look again on thee. \n
XII. \n
I can reduce all feelings but this one; \n
And that I would not; for at length I see \n
Such scenes as those wherein my life begun. \n
The earliest - even the only paths for me - \n
Had I but sooner learnt the crowd to shun, \n
I had been better than I now can be; \n
The passions which have torn me would have slept; \n
I had not suffer'd, and thou hadst not wept. \n
XIII. \n
With false Ambition what had I to do? \n
Little with Love, and least of all with Fame; \n
And yet they came unsought, and with me grew, \n
And made me all which they can make -a name. \n
Yet this was not the end I did pursue; \n
Surely I once beheld a nobler aim. \n
But all is over - I am one the more \n
To baffled millions which have gone before. \n
XIV. \n
And for the future, this world's future may \n
From me demand but little of my care; \n
I have outlived myself by many a day; \n
Having survived so many things that were; \n
My years have been no slumber, but the prey \n
Of ceaseless vigils; for I had the share \n
Of life which might have fill'd a century, \n
Before its fourth in time had pass'd me by. \n
XV. \n
And for the remnant which may be to come \n
I am content; and for the past I feel \n
Not thankless,-for within the crowded sum \n
Of struggles, happiness at times would steal, \n
And for the present, I would not benumb \n
My feelings further. - Nor shall I conceal \n
That with all this I still can look around, \n
And worship Nature with a thought profound. \n
XVI. \n
For thee, my own sweet sister, in thy heart \n
I know myself secure, as thou in mine; \n
We were and are - I am, even as thou art \n
Beings who ne'er each other can resign; \n
It is the same, together or apart, \n
From life's commencement to its slow decline \n
We are entwined-let death come slow or fast, \n
The tie which bound the first endures the last! \n<|endoftext|>
epistle \n
Read, lovely nymph, and tremble not to read, \n
I have no more to wish, nor you to dread; \n
I ask not life, for life to me were vain, \n
And death a refuge from severer pain. \n
My only hope in these last lines I try -- \n
I would be pitied, and I then would die. \n
Long had I liv'd as sordid as my fate, \n
Nor curs'd the destiny that made me wait \n
A servile slave: content with homely food, \n
The gross instinct of happiness pursued: \n
Youth gave me sleep at night and warmth of blood. \n
Ambition yet had never touch'd my breast; \n
My lordly master knew no sounder rest; \n
With labour healthy, in obedience blest. \n
But when I saw -- oh! had I never seen \n
That wounding softness, that engaging mien! \n
The mist of wretched education flies, \n
Shame, fear, desire, despair, and love arise, \n
The new creation of those beauteous eyes. \n
But yet that love pursu'd no guilty aim; \n
Deep in my heart I hid the secret flame: \n
I never hop'd my fond desire to tell, \n
And all my wishes were to serve you well. \n
Heav'ns! how I flew when wing'd by your command, \n
And kiss'd the letters giv'n me by your hand. \n
How pleas'd, how proud, how fond I was to wait, \n
Present the sparkling wine, or change the plate! \n
How, when you sung, my soul devour'd the sound, \n
And ev'ry sense was in the rapture drown'd! \n
Though bid to go, I quite forgot to move; \n
-- You knew not that stupidity was love! \n
But oh! the torment not to be express'd, \n
The grief, the rage, the hell, that fir'd this breast, \n
When my great rivals, in embroidery gay, \n
Sate by your side, or led you from the play! \n
I still contriv'd near as I could to stand \n
(the flambeau trembling in my shaking hand); \n
I saw, or thought I saw, those fingers press'd, \n
For thus their passion by my own I guess'd, \n
And jealous fury all my soul possess'd. \n
Like torrents, love and indignation meet, \n
And madness would have thrown me at your feet. \n
Turn, lovely nymph (for so I would have said), \n
Turn from those triflers who make love a trade; \n
This is true passion in my eyes you see; \n
They cannot, no -- they cannot love like me; \n
Frequent debauch has pall'd their sickly taste, \n
Faint their desire, and in a moment past; \n
They sigh not from the heart, but from the brain; \n
Vapours of vanity and strong champagne. \n
Too dull to feel what forms like yours inspire, \n
After long talking of their painted fire, \n
To some lewd brothel they at night retire; \n
There, pleas'd with fancy'd quality and charms, \n
Enjoy your beauties in a strumpet's arms. \n
Such are the joys those toasters have in view, \n
And such the wit and pleasure they pursue; \n
-- And is this love that ought to merit you? \n
Each opera night a new address begun, \n
They swear to thousands what they swear to one. \n
Not thus I sigh -- but all my sighs are vain -- \n
Die, wretched Arthur, and conceal thy pain: \n
'Tis impudence to wish, and madness to complain. \n
Fix'd on this view, my only hope of ease, \n
I waited not the aid of slow disease; \n
The keenest instruments of death I sought, \n
And death alone employ'd my lab'ring thought. \n
This all the night -- when I remember well \n
The charming tinkle of your morning bell! \n
Fir'd by the sound, I hasten'd with your tea, \n
With one last look to smooth the darksome way -- \n
But oh! how dear that fatal look has cost! \n
In that fond moment my resolves were lost. \n
Hence all my guilt, and all your sorrows rise -- \n
I saw the languid softness of your eyes; \n
I saw the dear disorder of your bed; \n
Your cheeks all glowing with a tempting red; \n
Your night-clothes tumbled with resistless grace, \n
Your flowing hair play'd careless down your face \n
Your night-gown fasten'd with a single pin; \n
-- Fancy improv'd the wondrous charms within! \n
I fix'd my eyes upon that heaving breast, \n
And hardly, hardly, I forbore the rest: \n
Eager to gaze, unsatisfied with sight, \n
My head grew giddy with the near delight! \n
-- Too well you know the fatal following night! \n
Th'extremest proof of my desire I give, \n
And since you will not love, I will not live. \n
Condemn'd by you, I wait the righteous doom. \n
Careless and fearless of the woes to come. \n
But when you see me waver in the wind, \n
My guilty flame extinct, my soul resign'd, \n
Sure you may pity what you can't approve, \n
The cruel consequence of furious love. \n
Think the bold wretch, that could so greatly dare, \n
Was tender, faithful, ardent, and sincere; \n
Think when I held the pistol to your breast, -- \n
Had I been of the world's large rule possess'd, -- \n
That world had then been yours, and I been blest; \n
Think that my life was quite below my care, \n
Nor fear'd I any hell beyond despair. -- \n
If these reflections, though they seize you late, \n
Give some compassion for your Arthur's fate: \n
Enough you give, nor ought I to complain: \n
You pay my pangs, nor have I died in vain. \n<|endoftext|>
epistle \n
Dear Sin, \n
It's a new day \n
Past two thousand fifteen \n
Another step I take \n
Into two thousand sixteen \n
It's a New year \n
And you were the very first thing that came my way... \n
I invited you on my journey \n
Of another 365+ quarter days \n
With long kisses to the quays \n
Holding to you night and day \n
Like a work-suit stuck with muddy clay \n
I still held on to you and stayed \n
Stuck on you, all day; \n
It's a new day... \n
Oh! Stuck on you \n
With this feeling down deep in my soul \n
That I just can't lose - \n
To you - \n
It's a new day; \n
Guess am on my way... \n
I needed a friend \n
Though times past it seemed like I'd be with you \n
Till the end; of the world \n
It's a new day; \n
Guess am on my way, home \n
And you tell me \n
Just be glad you stayed \n
Scoffers and mockers maybe \n
Me no way \n
Only for a few seconds will I be glad I stayed \n
Only for a few, nudity-ignited seconds will I be glad I stayed \n
Like fireworks \n
The fire burns for lustful desire \n
Then spreads and fades away - \n
It's a new day... \n
Just 3 days \n
Away to this year \n
I told myself with you I'll no longer stay \n
But here I am again \n
Allowing us, you and I, to stay \n
The same way \n
Still unsure if I will say \n
The truth and keep at bay \n
Maybe even see the end of today \n
It's a new day... \n
As I await tomorrow to come my way \n
And the words that you will say - \n
Jehovah God show me the way \n
It's a new day... \n

epistle \n
I GAT your letter, winsome Willie; \n
Wi' gratefu' heart I thank you brawlie; \n
Tho' I maun say't, I wad be silly, \n
And unco vain, \n
Should I believe, my coaxin billie \n
Your flatterin strain. \n
But I'se believe ye kindly meant it: \n
I sud be laith to think ye hinted \n
Ironic satire, sidelins sklented \n
On my poor Musie; \n
Tho' in sic phraisin terms ye've penn'd it, \n
I scarce excuse ye. \n
My senses wad be in a creel, \n
Should I but dare a hope to speel \n
Wi' Allan, or wi' Gilbertfield, \n
The braes o' fame; \n
Or Fergusson, the writer-chiel, \n
A deathless name. \n
(O Fergusson! thy glorious parts \n
Ill suited law's dry, musty arts! \n
My curse upon your whunstane hearts, \n
Ye E'nbrugh gentry! \n
The tithe o' what ye waste at cartes \n
Wad stow'd his pantry!) \n
Yet when a tale comes i' my head, \n
Or lassies gie my heart a screed— \n
As whiles they're like to be my dead, \n
(O sad disease!) \n
I kittle up my rustic reed; \n
It gies me ease. \n
Auld Coila now may fidge fu' fain, \n
She's gotten poets o' her ain; \n
Chiels wha their chanters winna hain, \n
But tune their lays, \n
Till echoes a' resound again \n
Her weel-sung praise. \n
Nae poet thought her worth his while, \n
To set her name in measur'd style; \n
She lay like some unkenn'd-of-isle \n
Beside New Holland, \n
Or whare wild-meeting oceans boil \n
Besouth Magellan. \n
Ramsay an' famous Fergusson \n
Gied Forth an' Tay a lift aboon; \n
Yarrow an' Tweed, to monie a tune, \n
Owre Scotland rings; \n
While Irwin, Lugar, Ayr, an' Doon \n
Naebody sings. \n
Th' Illissus, Tiber, Thames, an' Seine, \n
Glide sweet in monie a tunefu' line: \n
But Willie, set your fit to mine, \n
An' cock your crest; \n
We'll gar our streams an' burnies shine \n
Up wi' the best! \n
We'll sing auld Coila's plains an' fells, \n
Her moors red-brown wi' heather bells, \n
Her banks an' braes, her dens and dells, \n
Whare glorious Wallace \n
Aft bure the gree, as story tells, \n
Frae Suthron billies. \n
At Wallace' name, what Scottish blood \n
But boils up in a spring-tide flood! \n
Oft have our fearless fathers strode \n
By Wallace' side, \n
Still pressing onward, red-wat-shod, \n
Or glorious died! \n
O, sweet are Coila's haughs an' woods, \n
When lintwhites chant amang the buds, \n
And jinkin hares, in amorous whids, \n
Their loves enjoy; \n
While thro' the braes the cushat croods \n
With wailfu' cry! \n
Ev'n winter bleak has charms to me, \n
When winds rave thro' the naked tree; \n
Or frosts on hills of Ochiltree \n
Are hoary gray; \n
Or blinding drifts wild-furious flee, \n
Dark'ning the day! \n
O Nature! a' thy shews an' forms \n
To feeling, pensive hearts hae charms! \n
Whether the summer kindly warms, \n
Wi' life an light; \n
Or winter howls, in gusty storms, \n
The lang, dark night! \n
The muse, nae poet ever fand her, \n
Till by himsel he learn'd to wander, \n
Adown some trottin burn's meander, \n
An' no think lang: \n
O sweet to stray, an' pensive ponder \n
A heart-felt sang! \n
The war'ly race may drudge an' drive, \n
Hog-shouther, jundie, stretch, an' strive; \n
Let me fair Nature's face descrive, \n
And I, wi' pleasure, \n
Shall let the busy, grumbling hive \n
Bum owre their treasure. \n
Fareweel, "my rhyme-composing" brither! \n
We've been owre lang unkenn'd to ither: \n
Now let us lay our heads thegither, \n
In love fraternal: \n
May envy wallop in a tether, \n
Black fiend, infernal! \n
While Highlandmen hate tools an' taxes; \n
While moorlan's herds like guid, fat braxies; \n
While terra firma, on her axis, \n
Diurnal turns; \n
Count on a friend, in faith an' practice, \n
In Robert Burns. \n
POSTCRIPTMY memory's no worth a preen; \n
I had amaist forgotten clean, \n
Ye bade me write you what they mean \n
By this "new-light," \n
'Bout which our herds sae aft hae been \n
Maist like to fight. \n
In days when mankind were but callans \n
At grammar, logic, an' sic talents, \n
They took nae pains their speech to balance, \n
Or rules to gie; \n
But spak their thoughts in plain, braid lallans, \n
Like you or me. \n
In thae auld times, they thought the moon, \n
Just like a sark, or pair o' shoon, \n
Wore by degrees, till her last roon \n
Gaed past their viewin; \n
An' shortly after she was done \n
They gat a new ane. \n
This passed for certain, undisputed; \n
It ne'er cam i' their heads to doubt it, \n
Till chiels gat up an' wad confute it, \n
An' ca'd it wrang; \n
An' muckle din there was about it, \n
Baith loud an' lang. \n
Some herds, weel learn'd upo' the beuk, \n
Wad threap auld folk the thing misteuk; \n
For 'twas the auld moon turn'd a neuk \n
An' out of' sight, \n
An' backlins-comin to the leuk \n
She grew mair bright. \n
This was deny'd, it was affirm'd; \n
The herds and hissels were alarm'd \n
The rev'rend gray-beards rav'd an' storm'd, \n
That beardless laddies \n
Should think they better wer inform'd, \n
Than their auld daddies. \n
Frae less to mair, it gaed to sticks; \n
Frae words an' aiths to clours an' nicks; \n
An monie a fallow gat his licks, \n
Wi' hearty crunt; \n
An' some, to learn them for their tricks, \n
Were hang'd an' brunt. \n
This game was play'd in mony lands, \n
An' auld-light caddies bure sic hands, \n
That faith, the youngsters took the sands \n
Wi' nimble shanks; \n
Till lairds forbad, by strict commands, \n
Sic bluidy pranks. \n
But new-light herds gat sic a cowe, \n
Folk thought them ruin'd stick-an-stowe; \n
Till now, amaist on ev'ry knowe \n
Ye'll find ane plac'd; \n
An' some their new-light fair avow, \n
Just quite barefac'd. \n
Nae doubt the auld-light flocks are bleatin; \n
Their zealous herds are vex'd an' sweatin; \n
Mysel', I've even seen them greetin \n
Wi' girnin spite, \n
To hear the moon sae sadly lied on \n
By word an' write. \n
But shortly they will cowe the louns! \n
Some auld-light herds in neebor touns \n
Are mind't, in things they ca' balloons, \n
To tak a flight; \n
An' stay ae month amang the moons \n
An' see them right. \n
Guid observation they will gie them; \n
An' when the auld moon's gaun to lea'e them, \n
The hindmaist shaird, they'll fetch it wi' them \n
Just i' their pouch; \n
An' when the new-light billies see them, \n
I think they'll crouch! \n
Sae, ye observe that a' this clatter \n
Is naething but a "moonshine matter"; \n
But tho' dull prose-folk Latin splatter \n
In logic tulyie, \n
I hope we bardies ken some better \n
Than mind sic brulyie. \n<|endoftext|>
epistle \n
Great Hope of Britain!-Here the Muse essays \n
A theme, which, to attempt alone, is praise. \n
Be Her's a zeal of Public Spirit known! \n
A princely zeal!-a spirit all your own! \n
Where never science beam'd a friendly ray, \n
Where one vast blank neglected Nature lay; \n
From Public Spirit there, by arts employ'd, \n
Creation, varying, glads the cheerless void. \n
Hail arts, where safety, treasure and delight, \n
On land, on wave, in wond'rous works unite! \n
Those wond'rous works, O Muse, successive raise, \n
And point their worth, their dignity and praise! \n
What tho' no streams, magnificently play'd, \n
Rise a proud column, fall a grand cascade; \n
Thro' nether pipes, which nobler use renowns, \n
Lo! ductile riv'lets visit distant towns! \n
Now vanish fens, whence vapours rise no more, \n
Whose agueish influence tainted heav'n before. \n
The solid isthmus sinks a wat'ry space, \n
And wonders, in new state, at naval grace. \n
Where the flood, deep'ning, rolls, or wide extends, \n
From road to road, yon arch, connective, bends. \n
Where ports were choak'd where mounds, in vain, arose; \n
There harbours open, and there breaches close; \n
To keels, obedient, spreads each liquid plain, \n
And bulwark moles repel the bost'rous main. \n
When the sunk sun no homeward sail befriends, \n
On the rock's brow the light-house kind ascends, \n
And from the shoaly, o'er the gulfy way, \n
Points to the pilot's eye the warning ray. \n
Count still, my Muse (to count what Muse can cease?) \n
The works of Public Spirit, freedom, peace! \n
By the mshall plants, in forests, reach the skies; \n
Then lose their leafy pride, and navies rise: \n
(Navies, which to invasive foes explain, \n
Heav'n throws not round us rocks and seas in vain,) \n
The sail of commerce in each sky aspires, \n
And property assures what toil acquires. \n
Who digs the mine or quarry, digs with glee; \n
No slave!-His option and his gain are free: \n
Him the same laws the same protection yield, \n
Who plows the furrow, as who owns the field. \n
Unlike, where tyranny the rod maintains \n
O'er turfless, leafless, and uncultur'd plains, \n
Here herbs of food and physic plenty show'rs, \n
Gives fruits to blush, and colours various flow'rs. \n
Where sands or stony wilds once starv'd the year, \n
Laughs the green lawn, and nods the golden ear. \n
White shine the fleecy race, which fate shall doom \n
The feast of life, the treasure of the loom. \n
On plains now bare shall gardens wave their groves, \n
While settling songsters woo their feather'd loves. \n
Where pathless woods no grateful openings knew, \n
Walks tempt the step, and vistas court the view. \n
See the parterre confess expansive day; \n
The grot, elusive of the noon-tide ray. \n
Up yon green slope a length of terrace lies, \n
Whence gradual landscapes fade in distant skies. \n
Now the blue lake reflected heav'n displays; \n
Now darkens, regularly-wild, the maze. \n
Urns, obelisks, fanes, statues intervene; \n
Now center, now commence or end the scene. \n
Lo, proud alcoves! lo, soft sequester'd bow'rs! \n
Retreats of social, or of studious hours! \n
Rank above rank here shapely greens ascend; \n
There others natively-grotesque depend. \n
The rude, the delicate, immingled tell \n
How Art wou'd Nature, Nature, Art excell; \n
And how, while these their rival charms impart, \n
Art brightens Nature, Nature brightens Art; \n
Thus in the various, yet harmonious space, \n
Blend order, symmetry, and force, and grace. \n
When these from Public Spirit smile, we see \n
Free-opening gates, and bow'ry pleasures free; \n
For sure great souls one truth can never miss, \n
Bliss not communicated is not bliss. \n
Thus Public Spirit, liberty and peace, \n
Carve, build, and plant, and give the land increase; \n
From peasant hands imperial works arise, \n
And British, hence, with Roman grandeur vies; \n
Not grandeur that in pompous whim appears, \n
That levels hills, that vales to mountains rears; \n
That alters nature's regulated grace, \n
Meaning to deck, but destin'd to deface. \n
Tho' no proud gates, with China's taught to vie, \n
Magnificently useless, strike the eye; \n
(Useless, where rocks a surer barrier lend, \n
Where seas incircle, and where fleets defend \n
What tho' no arch of triumph is assign'd \n
To laurel'd pride, whose sword has thinn'd mankind; \n
Tho' no vast wall extends from coast to coast, \n
No pyramid aspires sublimely lost; \n
Yet the safe road thro' rocks shall winding tend, \n
And the firm causeway o'er the clays ascend. \n
Lo! stately streets, lo! ample squares invite \n
The salutary gale that breathes delight. \n
Lo! structures mark the charitable soil \n
For casual ill, maim'd valour, feeble toil \n
Worn out with care, infirmity and age; \n
The life here entering, quitting there the stage: \n
The babe of lawless birth, doom'd else to moan, \n
To starve or bleed for errors not his own! \n
Let the frail mother 'scape the fame defil'd, \n
If from the murd'ring mother 'scape the child! \n
Oh, guard his youth from sin's alluring voice; \n
From deeds of dire necessity, not choice! \n
His grateful hand, thus never harmful known, \n
Shall on the public welfare build his own. \n
Thus worthy crafts, which low-born life divide, \n
Give towns their opulence, and courts their pride. \n
Sacred to pleasure structures rise elate, \n
To that still worthy of the wise and great. \n
Sacred to pleasure then shall piles ascend? \n
They shall-when pleasure and instruction blend. \n
Let theatres, from Public Spirit shine! \n
Such theatres, as, Athens, once were thine! \n
See! the gay Muse, of pointed wit possest, \n
Who wakes the virtuous laugh, the decent jest: \n
What tho' she mock, she mocks with honest aim, \n
And laughs each fav'rite folly into shame. \n
With lib'ral light the tragic charms the age; \n
In solemn-training robes she fills the stage; \n
There human nature, mark'd in diff'rent lines, \n
Alive in character, distinctly shines. \n
Quick passions change alternate on her face; \n
Her diction music, as her action grace. \n
Instant we catch her terror-giving cares, \n
Pathetic sighs, and pity-moving tears; \n
Instant we catch her gen'rous glow of soul, \n
'Till one great striking moral crowns the whole. \n
Hence in warm youth, by scenes of virtue taught, \n
Honour exalts, and love expands the thought; \n
Hence pity, to peculiar grief assign'd, \n
Grows wide benevolence to all mankind. \n
Where various edifice the land renowns, \n
There Public Spirit plans, exalts, and crowns. \n
She cheers the mansion with the spacious hall, \n
Bids painting live along the storied wall; \n
Seated, she smiling eyes th' unclosing door, \n
And much she welcomes all, but most the poor; \n
She turns the pillar, or the arch she bends, \n
The choir she lengthens, or the choir extends; \n
She rears the tow'r, whose height the heav'ns admire; \n
(She rears, she rounds, she points the less'ning spire; \n
At her command the college-roofs ascend; \n
For Public Spirit still is learning's friend.) \n
Stupendous piles, which useful pomp compleats, \n
Thus rise Religion's, and thus Learning's seats: \n
There moral truth and holy science spring, \n
And give the sage to teach, the bard to sing. \n
There some draw health from herbs and min'ral veins, \n
Some search the systems of the heavenly plains; \n
Some call from history, past times to view, \n
And others trace old laws, and sketch out new; \n
Thence saving rights by legislators plann'd, \n
And guardian patriots thence inspire the land. \n
Now grant, ye pow'rs, one great, one fond desire, \n
And, granting, bid a new Whitehall aspire! \n
Far let it lead, by well-pleas'd Thames survey'd, \n
The swelling arch, and stately colonnade; \n
Bid courts of justice, senate-chambers join, \n
Till various all in one proud work combine! \n
But now be all the gen'rous Goddess seen, \n
When most diffus'd she shines, and most benign! \n
Ye sons of misery attract her view! \n
Ye sallow, hollow-ey'd, and meagre crew! \n
Such high perfection have our arts attain'd, \n
That now few sons of toil our arts demand? \n
Then to the public, to itself, we fear, \n
Ev'n willing industry grows useless here. \n
Are we too populous at length confess'd, \n
From confluent strangers refug'd and redress'd? \n
Has war so long withdrawn his barb'rous train, \n
That peace o'erstocks us with the sons of men? \n
So long has plague left pure the ambient air, \n
That want must prey on those disease would spare? \n
Hence beauteous wretches (beauty's foul disgrace!) \n
Tho' born the pride, the shame of human race; \n
Fair wretches hence, who nightly streets annoy, \n
Live but themselves and others to destroy. \n
Hence robbers rise, to theft, to murder prone, \n
First driv'n by want, from habit desp'rate grown; \n
Hence, for ow'd trifles, oft our jails contain \n
(Torn from mankind) a miserable train; \n
Torn from, in spite of nature's tend'rest cries, \n
Parental, filial, and connubial ties: \n
The trader, when on ev'ry side distrest, \n
Hence flies to what expedient frauds suggest; \n
To prop his question'd credit's tott'ring state, \n
Others he first involves to share his fate; \n
Then for mean refuge must self-exil'd roam, \n
Never to hope a friend, or find a home. \n
This Public Spirit sees, she sees and feels! \n
Her breast the throb, her eye the tear reveals; \n
(The patriot throb that beats, the tear that flows \n
For others welfare, and for others woes)- \n
And what can I (she said) to cure their grief? \n
Shall I or point out death, or point relief? \n
Forth shall I lead 'em to some happier soil, \n
To conquest lead 'em, and enrich with spoil? \n
Bid 'em convulse a world, make Nature groan, \n
And spill, in shedding others blood, their own? \n
No, no-such wars do thou, Ambition, wage! \n
Go sterilize the fertile with thy rage! \n
Whole nations to depopulate is thine; \n
To people, culture, and protect, be mine! \n
Then range the world, Discov'ry!-Straight he goes \n
O'er seas, o'er Lybia's sands, and Zembla's snows; \n
He settles where kind rays till now have smil'd \n
(Vain smile!) on some luxuriant houseless wild. \n
How many sons of want might here enjoy \n
What Nature gives for age but to destroy? \n
Blush, blush, O sun (she cries) here vainly found, \n
To rise, to set, to roll the seasons round! \n
Shall heav'n distil in dews, descend in rain, \n
From earth gush fountains, rivers flow-in vain? \n
There shall the wat'ry lives in myriads stray, \n
And be, to be alone each other's prey? \n
Unsought shall here the teeming quarries own \n
The various species of mechanic stone? \n
From structure this, from sculpture that confine? \n
Shall rocks forbid the latent gem to shine? \n
Shall mines obedient, aid no artists care, \n
Nor give the martial sword and peaceful share? \n
Ah! shall they never precious ore unfold, \n
To smile in silver, or to flame in gold? \n
Shall here the vegetable world alone, \n
For joys, for various virtues, rest unknown? \n
While food and physic, plants and herbs supply, \n
Here must they shoot alone to bloom and die? \n
Shall fruits, which none but brutal eyes survey, \n
Untouch'd grow ripe, untasted drop away? \n
Shall here th' irrational, the savage kind, \n
Lord it o'er stores by heav'n for man design'd, \n
And trample what mild suns benignly raise, \n
While man must lose the use, and heav'n the praise; \n
Shall it then be?-Indignant here she rose, \n
(Indignant, yet humane, her bosom glows)- \n
No! By each honour'd Grecian, Roman name, \n
By men for virtue deify'd by fame, \n
Who peopled lands, who model'd infant state, \n
And then bade empire be maturely great; \n
By these I swear (be witness earth and skies!) \n
Fair Order here shall from Confusion rise. \n
Rapt, I a future colony survey! \n
Come then, ye sons of Mis'ry! come away! \n
Let those, whose sorrows from neglect are known, \n
(Here taught, compell'd, empower'd) neglect atone; \n
Let those enjoy, who never merit woes, \n
In youth th' industrious wish, in age repose! \n
Allotted acres (no reluctant soil) \n
Shall prompt their industry, and pay their toil. \n
Let families, long strangers to delight, \n
Whom wayward fate dispers'd, by me unite; \n
Here live enjoying life; see plenty, peace; \n
Their lands increasing as their sons increase. \n
As nature yet is found, in leafy glades, \n
To intermix the walks with lights and shades; \n
Or as with good and ill, in chequer'd strife, \n
Various the goddess colours human life; \n
So, in this fertile clime, if yet are seen \n
Moors, marshes, cliffs, by turns to intervene; \n
Where cliffs, moors, marshes desolate the view, \n
Where haunts the bittern, and where screams the mew; \n
Where prowls the wolf, where roll'd the serpent lies, \n
Shall solemn fanes and halls of justice rise, \n
And towns shall open (all of structure fair!) \n
To bright'ning prospects, and to purest air; \n
Frequented ports, and vineyards green succeed, \n
And flocks increasing whiten all the mead. \n
On science, science, arts on arts refine; \n
On these, from high, all heav'n shall smiling shine, \n
And Public Spirit here a people show, \n
Free, num'rous, pleas'd, and busy all below. \n
Learn, future natives of this promis'd land, \n
What your forefathers ow'd my saving hand! \n
Learn, when Despair such sudden bliss shall see, \n
Such bliss must shine from Oglethorpe or me! \n
Do you the neighb'ring blameless Indian aid, \n
Culture what he neglects, not his invade; \n
Dare not, Oh dare not, with ambitious view, \n
Force or demand subjection never due. \n
Let, by my specious name, no tyrants rise, \n
And cry, while they enslave, they civilize! \n
Know, Liberty and I are still the same, \n
Congenial!-ever mingling flame with flame! \n
Why must I Afric's sable children see \n
Vended for slaves, tho' form'd by nature free, \n
The nameless tortures cruel minds invent, \n
Those to subject, whom nature equal meant? \n
If these you dare (albeit unjust success \n
Empow'rs you now unpunish'd to oppress) \n
Revolving empire you and yours may doom, \n
(Rome all subdu'd, yet Vandals vanquish'd Rome,) \n
Yes, empire may revolve, give them the day, \n
And yoke may yoke, and blood may blood repay. \n
Thus (ah! how far unequall'd by my lays, \n
Unskill'd the heart to melt or mind to raise,) \n
Sublime, benevolent, deep, sweetly-clear, \n
Worthy a Thomson's Muse, a Fred'rick's ear, \n
Thus spoke the Goddess. Thus I faintly tell \n
In what lov'd works heav'n gives her to excel. \n
But who her sons, that, to her int'rest true, \n
Conversant lead her to a prince like you? \n
These, Sir, salute you from life's middle state, \n
Rich without gold, and without titles great: \n
Knowledge of books and men exalts their thought, \n
In wit accomplish'd, tho' in wiles untaught, \n
Careless of whispers meant to wound their name, \n
Nor sneer'd nor brib'd from virtue into shame; \n
In letters elegant, in honour bright, \n
They come, they catch, and they reflect delight. \n
Mixing with these a few of rank are found, \n
For councils, embassies, and camps renown'd. \n
Vers'd in gay life, in honest maxims read, \n
And ever warm of heart, yet cool of head. \n
From these the circling glass gives wit to shine, \n
The bright grow brighter, and ev'n courts refine; \n
From these so gifted, candid, and upright, \n
Flows knowledge, soft'ning into ease polite. \n
Happy the men, who such a prince can please! \n
Happy the prince rever'd by men like these! \n
His condescensions dignity display, \n
Grave with the wise, and with the witty gay; \n
For him fine marble in the quarry lies, \n
Which, in due statues, to his fame shall rise; \n
Ever shall Public Spirit beam his praise, \n
And the Muse swell it in immortal lays. \n<|endoftext|>
epistle \n
Shut, shut the door, good John! fatigu'd, I said, \n
Tie up the knocker, say I'm sick, I'm dead. \n
The dog-star rages! nay 'tis past a doubt, \n
All Bedlam, or Parnassus, is let out: \n
Fire in each eye, and papers in each hand, \n
They rave, recite, and madden round the land. \n
What walls can guard me, or what shades can hide? \n
They pierce my thickets, through my grot they glide; \n
By land, by water, they renew the charge; \n
They stop the chariot, and they board the barge. \n
No place is sacred, not the church is free; \n
Ev'n Sunday shines no Sabbath-day to me: \n
Then from the Mint walks forth the man of rhyme, \n
Happy! to catch me just at dinner-time. \n
Is there a parson, much bemus'd in beer, \n
A maudlin poetess, a rhyming peer, \n
A clerk, foredoom'd his father's soul to cross, \n
Who pens a stanza, when he should engross? \n
Is there, who, lock'd from ink and paper, scrawls \n
With desp'rate charcoal round his darken'd walls? \n
All fly to Twit'nam, and in humble strain \n
Apply to me, to keep them mad or vain. \n
Arthur, whose giddy son neglects the laws, \n
Imputes to me and my damn'd works the cause: \n
Poor Cornus sees his frantic wife elope, \n
And curses wit, and poetry, and Pope. \n
Friend to my life! (which did not you prolong, \n
The world had wanted many an idle song) \n
What drop or nostrum can this plague remove? \n
Or which must end me, a fool's wrath or love? \n
A dire dilemma! either way I'm sped, \n
If foes, they write, if friends, they read me dead. \n
Seiz'd and tied down to judge, how wretched I! \n
Who can't be silent, and who will not lie; \n
To laugh, were want of goodness and of grace, \n
And to be grave, exceeds all pow'r of face. \n
I sit with sad civility, I read \n
With honest anguish, and an aching head; \n
And drop at last, but in unwilling ears, \n
This saving counsel, 'Keep your piece nine years.' \n
'Nine years! ' cries he, who high in Drury-lane \n
Lull'd by soft zephyrs through the broken pane, \n
Rhymes ere he wakes, and prints before Term ends, \n
Oblig'd by hunger, and request of friends: \n
'The piece, you think, is incorrect: why, take it, \n
I'm all submission, what you'd have it, make it.' \n
Three things another's modest wishes bound, \n
My friendship, and a prologue, and ten pound. \n
Pitholeon sends to me: 'You know his Grace, \n
I want a patron; ask him for a place.' \n
Pitholeon libell'd me- 'but here's a letter \n
Informs you, sir, 'twas when he knew no better. \n
Dare you refuse him? Curll invites to dine, \n
He'll write a Journal, or he'll turn Divine.' \n
Bless me! a packet- ''Tis a stranger sues, \n
A virgin tragedy, an orphan muse.' \n
If I dislike it, 'Furies, death and rage! ' \n
If I approve, 'Commend it to the stage.' \n
There (thank my stars) my whole commission ends, \n
The play'rs and I are, luckily, no friends. \n
Fir'd that the house reject him, ''Sdeath I'll print it, \n
And shame the fools- your int'rest, sir, with Lintot! ' \n
'Lintot, dull rogue! will think your price too much.' \n
'Not, sir, if you revise it, and retouch.' \n
All my demurs but double his attacks; \n
At last he whispers, 'Do; and we go snacks.' \n
Glad of a quarrel, straight I clap the door, \n
'Sir, let me see your works and you no more.' \n
'Tis sung, when Midas' ears began to spring, \n
(Midas, a sacred person and a king) \n
His very minister who spied them first, \n
(Some say his queen) was forc'd to speak, or burst. \n
And is not mine, my friend, a sorer case, \n
When ev'ry coxcomb perks them in my face? \n
'Good friend, forbear! you deal in dang'rous things. \n
I'd never name queens, ministers, or kings; \n
Keep close to ears, and those let asses prick; \n
'Tis nothing'- Nothing? if they bite and kick? \n
Out with it, Dunciad! let the secret pass, \n
That secret to each fool, that he's an ass: \n
The truth once told (and wherefore should we lie?) \n
The queen of Midas slept, and so may I. \n
You think this cruel? take it for a rule, \n
No creature smarts so little as a fool. \n
Let peals of laughter, Codrus! round thee break, \n
Thou unconcern'd canst hear the mighty crack: \n
Pit, box, and gall'ry in convulsions hurl'd, \n
Thou stand'st unshook amidst a bursting world. \n
Who shames a scribbler? break one cobweb through, \n
He spins the slight, self-pleasing thread anew; \n
Destroy his fib or sophistry, in vain, \n
The creature's at his dirty work again; \n
Thron'd in the centre of his thin designs; \n
Proud of a vast extent of flimsy lines! \n
Whom have I hurt? has poet yet, or peer, \n
Lost the arch'd eye-brow, or Parnassian sneer? \n
And has not Colley still his lord, and whore? \n
His butchers Henley, his Free-masons Moore? \n
Does not one table Bavius still admit? \n
Still to one bishop Philips seem a wit? \n
Still Sappho- 'Hold! for God-sake- you'll offend: \n
No names! - be calm! - learn prudence of a friend! \n
I too could write, and I am twice as tall; \n
But foes like these! ' One flatt'rer's worse than all. \n
Of all mad creatures, if the learn'd are right, \n
It is the slaver kills, and not the bite. \n
A fool quite angry is quite innocent; \n
Alas! 'tis ten times worse when they repent. \n
One dedicates in high heroic prose, \n
And ridicules beyond a hundred foes; \n
One from all Grub Street will my fame defend, \n
And, more abusive, calls himself my friend. \n
This prints my Letters, that expects a bribe, \n
And others roar aloud, 'Subscribe, subscribe.' \n
There are, who to my person pay their court: \n
I cough like Horace, and, though lean, am short, \n
Ammon's great son one shoulder had too high, \n
Such Ovid's nose, and 'Sir! you have an eye'- \n
Go on, obliging creatures, make me see \n
All that disgrac'd my betters, met in me: \n
Say for my comfort, languishing in bed, \n
'Just so immortal Maro held his head:' \n
And when I die, be sure you let me know \n
Great Homer died three thousand years ago. \n
Why did I write? what sin to me unknown \n
Dipp'd me in ink, my parents', or my own? \n
As yet a child, nor yet a fool to fame, \n
I lisp'd in numbers, for the numbers came. \n
I left no calling for this idle trade, \n
No duty broke, no father disobey'd. \n
The Muse but serv'd to ease some friend, not wife, \n
To help me through this long disease, my life, \n
To second, Arbuthnot! thy art and care, \n
And teach the being you preserv'd, to bear. \n
But why then publish? Granville the polite, \n
And knowing Walsh, would tell me I could write; \n
Well-natur'd Garth inflamed with early praise, \n
And Congreve lov'd, and Swift endur'd my lays; \n
The courtly Talbot, Somers, Sheffield read, \n
Ev'n mitred Rochester would nod the head, \n
And St. John's self (great Dryden's friends before) \n
With open arms receiv'd one poet more. \n
Happy my studies, when by these approv'd! \n
Happier their author, when by these belov'd! \n
From these the world will judge of men and books, \n
Not from the Burnets, Oldmixons, and Cookes. \n
Soft were my numbers; who could take offence, \n
While pure description held the place of sense? \n
Like gentle Fanny's was my flow'ry theme, \n
A painted mistress, or a purling stream. \n
Yet then did Gildon draw his venal quill; \n
I wish'd the man a dinner, and sat still. \n
Yet then did Dennis rave in furious fret; \n
I never answer'd, I was not in debt. \n
If want provok'd, or madness made them print, \n
I wag'd no war with Bedlam or the Mint. \n
Did some more sober critic come abroad? \n
If wrong, I smil'd; if right, I kiss'd the rod. \n
Pains, reading, study, are their just pretence, \n
And all they want is spirit, taste, and sense. \n
Commas and points they set exactly right, \n
And 'twere a sin to rob them of their mite. \n
Yet ne'er one sprig of laurel grac'd these ribalds, \n
From slashing Bentley down to pidling Tibbalds. \n
Each wight who reads not, and but scans and spells, \n
Each word-catcher that lives on syllables, \n
Ev'n such small critics some regard may claim, \n
Preserv'd in Milton's or in Shakespeare's name. \n
Pretty! in amber to observe the forms \n
Of hairs, or straws, or dirt, or grubs, or worms; \n
The things, we know, are neither rich nor rare, \n
But wonder how the devil they got there? \n
Were others angry? I excus'd them too; \n
Well might they rage; I gave them but their due. \n
A man's true merit 'tis not hard to find, \n
But each man's secret standard in his mind, \n
That casting weight pride adds to emptiness, \n
This, who can gratify? for who can guess? \n
The bard whom pilfer'd pastorals renown, \n
Who turns a Persian tale for half a crown, \n
Just writes to make his barrenness appear, \n
And strains, from hard-bound brains, eight lines a year: \n
He, who still wanting, though he lives on theft, \n
Steals much, spends little, yet has nothing left: \n
And he, who now to sense, now nonsense leaning, \n
Means not, but blunders round about a meaning: \n
And he, whose fustian's so sublimely bad, \n
It is not poetry, but prose run mad: \n
All these, my modest satire bade translate, \n
And own'd, that nine such poets made a Tate. \n
How did they fume, and stamp, and roar, and chafe? \n
And swear, not Addison himself was safe. \n
Peace to all such! but were there one whose fires \n
True genius kindles, and fair fame inspires, \n
Blest with each talent and each art to please, \n
And born to write, converse, and live with ease: \n
Should such a man, too fond to rule alone, \n
Bear, like the Turk, no brother near the throne, \n
View him with scornful, yet with jealous eyes, \n
And hate for arts that caus'd himself to rise; \n
Damn with faint praise, assent with civil leer, \n
And without sneering, teach the rest to sneer; \n
Willing to wound, and yet afraid to strike, \n
Just hint a fault, and hesitate dislike; \n
Alike reserv'd to blame, or to commend, \n
A tim'rous foe, and a suspicious friend; \n
Dreading ev'n fools, by flatterers besieg'd, \n
And so obliging, that he ne'er oblig'd; \n
Like Cato, give his little senate laws, \n
And sit attentive to his own applause; \n
While wits and templars ev'ry sentence raise, \n
And wonder with a foolish face of praise. \n
Who but must laugh, if such a man there be? \n
Who would not weep, if Atticus were he? \n
What though my name stood rubric on the walls, \n
Or plaister'd posts, with claps, in capitals? \n
Or smoking forth, a hundred hawkers' load, \n
On wings of winds came flying all abroad? \n
I sought no homage from the race that write; \n
I kept, like Asian monarchs, from their sight: \n
Poems I heeded (now berhym'd so long) \n
No more than thou, great George! a birthday song. \n
I ne'er with wits or witlings pass'd my days, \n
To spread about the itch of verse and praise; \n
Nor like a puppy, daggled through the town, \n
To fetch and carry sing-song up and down; \n
Nor at rehearsals sweat, and mouth'd, and cried, \n
With handkerchief and orange at my side; \n
But sick of fops, and poetry, and prate, \n
To Bufo left the whole Castalian state. \n
Proud as Apollo on his forked hill, \n
Sat full-blown Bufo, puff'd by every quill; \n
Fed with soft dedication all day long, \n
Horace and he went hand in hand in song. \n
His library (where busts of poets dead \n
And a true Pindar stood without a head,) \n
Receiv'd of wits an undistinguish'd race, \n
Who first his judgment ask'd, and then a place: \n
Much they extoll'd his pictures, much his seat, \n
And flatter'd ev'ry day, and some days eat: \n
Till grown more frugal in his riper days, \n
He paid some bards with port, and some with praise, \n
To some a dry rehearsal was assign'd, \n
And others (harder still) he paid in kind. \n
Dryden alone (what wonder?) came not nigh, \n
Dryden alone escap'd this judging eye: \n
But still the great have kindness in reserve, \n
He help'd to bury whom he help'd to starve. \n
May some choice patron bless each grey goose quill! \n
May ev'ry Bavius have his Bufo still! \n
So, when a statesman wants a day's defence, \n
Or envy holds a whole week's war with sense, \n
Or simple pride for flatt'ry makes demands, \n
May dunce by dunce be whistled off my hands! \n
Blest be the great! for those they take away, \n
And those they left me- for they left me Gay; \n
Left me to see neglected genius bloom, \n
Neglected die! and tell it on his tomb; \n
Of all thy blameless life the sole return \n
My verse, and Queensb'ry weeping o'er thy urn! \n
Oh let me live my own! and die so too! \n
('To live and die is all I have to do:') \n
Maintain a poet's dignity and ease, \n
And see what friends, and read what books I please. \n
Above a patron, though I condescend \n
Sometimes to call a minister my friend: \n
I was not born for courts or great affairs; \n
I pay my debts, believe, and say my pray'rs; \n
Can sleep without a poem in my head, \n
Nor know, if Dennis be alive or dead. \n
Why am I ask'd what next shall see the light? \n
Heav'ns! was I born for nothing but to write? \n
Has life no joys for me? or (to be grave) \n
Have I no friend to serve, no soul to save? \n
'I found him close with Swift'- 'Indeed? no doubt', \n
(Cries prating Balbus) 'something will come out'. \n
'Tis all in vain, deny it as I will. \n
'No, such a genius never can lie still,' \n
And then for mine obligingly mistakes \n
The first lampoon Sir Will. or Bubo makes. \n
Poor guiltless I! and can I choose but smile, \n
When ev'ry coxcomb knows me by my style? \n
Curs'd be the verse, how well soe'er it flow, \n
That tends to make one worthy man my foe, \n
Give virtue scandal, innocence a fear, \n
Or from the soft-ey'd virgin steal a tear! \n
But he, who hurts a harmless neighbour's peace, \n
Insults fall'n worth, or beauty in distress, \n
Who loves a lie, lame slander helps about, \n
Who writes a libel, or who copies out: \n
That fop, whose pride affects a patron's name, \n
Yet absent, wounds an author's honest fame; \n
Who can your merit selfishly approve, \n
And show the sense of it without the love; \n
Who has the vanity to call you friend, \n
Yet wants the honour, injur'd, to defend; \n
Who tells what'er you think, whate'er you say, \n
And, if he lie not, must at least betray: \n
Who to the Dean, and silver bell can swear, \n
And sees at Cannons what was never there; \n
Who reads, but with a lust to misapply, \n
Make satire a lampoon, and fiction, lie. \n
A lash like mine no honest man shall dread, \n
But all such babbling blockheads in his stead. \n
Let Sporus tremble- 'What? that thing of silk, \n
Sporus, that mere white curd of ass's milk? \n
Satire or sense, alas! can Sporus feel? \n
Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel? ' \n
Yet let me flap this bug with gilded wings, \n
This painted child of dirt that stinks and stings; \n
Whose buzz the witty and the fair annoys, \n
Yet wit ne'er tastes, and beauty ne'r enjoys, \n
So well-bred spaniels civilly delight \n
In mumbling of the game they dare not bite. \n
Eternal smiles his emptiness betray, \n
As shallow streams run dimpling all the way. \n
Whether in florid impotence he speaks, \n
And, as the prompter breathes, the puppet squeaks; \n
Or at the ear of Eve, familiar toad, \n
Half froth, half venom, spits himself abroad, \n
In puns, or politics, or tales, or lies, \n
Or spite, or smut, or rhymes, or blasphemies. \n
His wit all see-saw, between that and this, \n
Now high, now low, now Master up, now Miss, \n
And he himself one vile antithesis. \n
Amphibious thing! that acting either part, \n
The trifling head, or the corrupted heart, \n
Fop at the toilet, flatt'rer at the board, \n
Now trips a lady, and now struts a lord. \n
Eve's tempter thus the rabbins have express'd, \n
A cherub's face, a reptile all the rest; \n
Beauty that shocks you, parts that none will trust, \n
Wit that can creep, and pride that licks the dust. \n
Not fortune's worshipper, nor fashion's fool, \n
Not lucre's madman, nor ambition's tool, \n
Not proud, nor servile, be one poet's praise, \n
That, if he pleas'd, he pleas'd by manly ways; \n
That flatt'ry, even to kings, he held a shame, \n
And thought a lie in verse or prose the same: \n
That not in fancy's maze he wander'd long, \n
But stoop'd to truth, and moraliz'd his song: \n
That not for fame, but virtue's better end, \n
He stood the furious foe, the timid friend, \n
The damning critic, half-approving wit, \n
The coxcomb hit, or fearing to be hit; \n
Laugh'd at the loss of friends he never had, \n
The dull, the proud, the wicked, and the mad; \n
The distant threats of vengeance on his head, \n
The blow unfelt, the tear he never shed; \n
The tale reviv'd, the lie so oft o'erthrown; \n
Th' imputed trash, and dulness not his own; \n
The morals blacken'd when the writings 'scape; \n
The libell'd person, and the pictur'd shape; \n
Abuse, on all he lov'd, or lov'd him, spread, \n
A friend in exile, or a father, dead; \n
The whisper, that to greatness still too near, \n
Perhaps, yet vibrates on his sovereign's ear:- \n
Welcome for thee, fair Virtue! all the past: \n
For thee, fair Virtue! welcome ev'n the last! \n
'But why insult the poor? affront the great? ' \n
A knave's a knave, to me, in ev'ry state: \n
Alike my scorn, if he succeed or fail, \n
Sporus at court, or Japhet in a jail, \n
A hireling scribbler, or a hireling peer, \n
Knight of the post corrupt, or of the shire; \n
If on a pillory, or near a throne, \n
He gain his prince's ear, or lose his own. \n
Yet soft by nature, more a dupe than wit, \n
Sappho can tell you how this man was bit: \n
This dreaded sat'rist Dennis will confess \n
Foe to his pride, but friend to his distress: \n
So humble, he has knock'd at Tibbald's door, \n
Has drunk with Cibber, nay, has rhym'd for Moore. \n
Full ten years slander'd, did he once reply? \n
Three thousand suns went down on Welsted's lie. \n
To please a mistress one aspers'd his life; \n
He lash'd him not, but let her be his wife. \n
Let Budgell charge low Grub Street on his quill, \n
And write whate'er he pleas'd, except his will; \n
Let the two Curlls of town and court, abuse \n
His father, mother, body, soul, and muse. \n
Yet why? that father held it for a rule, \n
It was a sin to call our neighbour fool: \n
That harmless mother thought no wife a whore,- \n
Hear this! and spare his family, James Moore! \n
Unspotted names! and memorable long, \n
If there be force in virtue, or in song. \n
Of gentle blood (part shed in honour's cause, \n
While yet in Britain honour had applause) \n
Each parent sprung- 'What fortune, pray? '- Their own, \n
And better got, than Bestia's from the throne. \n
Born to no pride, inheriting no strife, \n
Nor marrying discord in a noble wife, \n
Stranger to civil and religious rage, \n
The good man walk'd innoxious through his age. \n
No courts he saw, no suits would ever try, \n
Nor dar'd an oath, nor hazarded a lie: \n
Un-learn'd, he knew no schoolman's subtle art, \n
No language, but the language of the heart. \n
By nature honest, by experience wise, \n
Healthy by temp'rance and by exercise; \n
His life, though long, to sickness past unknown; \n
His death was instant, and without a groan. \n
O grant me, thus to live, and thus to die! \n
Who sprung from kings shall know less joy than I. \n
O friend! may each domestic bliss be thine! \n
Be no unpleasing melancholy mine: \n
Me, let the tender office long engage \n
To rock the cradle of reposing age, \n
With lenient arts extend a mother's breath, \n
Make langour smile, and smooth the bed of death, \n
Explore the thought, explain the asking eye, \n
And keep a while one parent from the sky! \n
On cares like these if length of days attend, \n
May Heav'n, to bless those days, preserve my friend, \n
Preserve him social, cheerful, and serene, \n
And just as rich as when he serv'd a queen. \n
Whether that blessing be denied or giv'n, \n
Thus far was right, the rest belongs to Heav'n. \n<|endoftext|>
epistle \n
'Tis not that I design to rob \n
Thee of thy birthright, gentle Bob,-- \n
For thou art born sole heir and single \n
Of dear Mat Prior's easy jingle; \n
Nor that I mean, while thus I knit \n
My threadbare sentiments together, \n
To show my genius or my wit, \n
When God and you know I have neither, \n
Or such, as might be better shown \n
By letting poetry alone. \n
'Tis not with either of these views, \n
That I presume to address the Muse: \n
But to divert a fierce banditti, \n
(Sworn foes to everything that's witty), \n
That, with a black infernal train, \n
Make cruel inroads in my brain, \n
And daily threaten to drive thence \n
My little garrison of sense: \n
The fierce banditti which I mean, \n
Are gloomy thoughts led on by spleen. \n
Then there's another reason yet, \n
Which is, that I may fairly quit \n
The debt which justly became due \n
The moment when I heard from you: \n
And you might grumble, crony mine, \n
If paid in any other coin; \n
Since twenty sheets of lead, God knows, \n
(I would say twenty sheets of prose), \n
Can ne'er be deemed worth half so much \n
As one of gold, and yours was such. \n
Thus the preliminaries settled, \n
I fairly find myself pitch-kettled; \n
And cannot see, though few see better, \n
How I shall hammer out a letter. \n
First, for a thought -- since all agree-- \n
A thought -- I have it -- let me see-- \n
'Tis gone again -- plague on't! I thought \n
I had it -- but I have it not. \n
Dame Gurton thus and Hodge her son \n
That useful thing, her needle, gone, \n
Rake well the cinders, sweep the floor, \n
And sift the dust behind the door; \n
While eager Hodge beholds the prize \n
In old grimalkin's glaring eyes; \n
And Gammar finds it on her knees \n
In every shining straw she sees. \n
This simile were apt enough, \n
But I've another, critic-proof. \n
The virtuoso thus at noon, \n
Broiling beneath a July sun, \n
The gilded butterfly pursues \n
O'er hedge and ditch, through gaps and mews, \n
And after many a vain essay \n
To captivate the tempting prey, \n
Gives him at length the lucky pat, \n
And has him safe beneath his hat: \n
Then lifts it gently from the ground, \n
But ah! 'tis lost as soon as found; \n
Culprit his liberty regains; \n
Flits out of sight and mocks his pains. \n
The sense was dark, 'twas therefore (--?) \n
With simile to illustrate it; \n
But as too much obscures the sight, \n
As often as too little light, \n
We have our similes cut short, \n
For matters of more grave import. \n
That Matthew's numbers run with ease \n
Each man of common sense agrees; \n
All men of common sense allow, \n
That Robert's lines are easy too; \n
Where then the preference shall we place, \n
Or how do justice in this case? \n
Matthew (says Fame) with endless pains \n
Smoothed and refined the meanest strains, \n
Nor suffered one ill-chosen rhyme \n
To escape him at the idlest time; \n
And thus o'er all a lustre cast, \n
That while the language lives shall last. \n
An't please your ladyship, (quoth I, \n
For 'tis my business to reply); \n
Sure so much labour, so much toil, \n
Bespeak at least a stubborn soil. \n
Theirs be the laurel-wreath decreed, \n
Who both write well and write full speed; \n
Who throw their Helicon about \n
As freely as a conduit spout. \n
Friend Robert, thus like chien scavant, \n
Lets fall a poem en passant, \n
Nor needs his genuine ore refine; \n
'Tis ready polished from the mine. \n<|endoftext|>

The fight was over, and the battle won \n
A soldier, who beneath his chieftain’s eye \n
Had done a might deed and done it well, \n
And done it as the world will have it done— \n
A stab, a curse, some quick play of the butt, \n
Two skulls cracked crosswise, but the colours saved— \n
Proud of his wounds, proud of the promised cross, \n
Turned to his rear-rank man, who on his gun \n
Leant heavily apart. ‘Ho, friend!’ he called, \n
‘You did not fight then: were you left behind? \n
I saw you not.’ The other turned and showed \n
A gapping, red-lipped wound upon his breast. \n
‘Ah,’ said he sadly, ‘I was in the smoke!’ \n
Threw up his arms, shivered, and fell and died. \n<|endoftext|>

Yet as age encumbers him \n
he is driven from the pack \n
and looses his self-esteem \n
while in vain he tries to get his position back \n
and when old, wounded and in pain \n
at a time he gets real thin \n
and even fears the thunder that comes with rain \n
while it’s a pitiful position that he is in \n
as through the years he had developed his skills \n
but a time comes that his kingdom to him is lost \n
while he not apt to make anymore kills \n
and finally he has to pay the cost \n

allegory \n
Abandoned prams, empty identical wired \n
with white typed feeding bibs about \n
and missing their coin deposits, chains dangling, unhired. \n
Staggering down the street they come, accepted \n
like cold rejoinders and unspeakable truths \n
of so much selfish, post-coital regret and haggling. \n
Unconsciously I quicken stiffen, adrenaline flowing \n
to satiate biological need, without shame judgement following. \n
The faster bounce rhythm of the trailer \n
oddly reassuring should I have car parking failure. \n
Wish and wash, my spirit, glass door sliding \n
only 21 days and kids fourteen, distant. \n
This is home help and annual chance, the limitations of others \n
not a father’s need for moral guidance. \n
Foyer clean warm, but what is he doing here: \n
a psycho babbler, purposeful and at home \n
standing up straight and proud, even while in another world. \n
Staff and customer study the invisible, ignore \n
mongrel dog and guard morose at door. \n
The mental’s face obscured by lucky charm or paper fetish - \n
Blake’s Collected Works and Engravings, must be only minutes stolen. \n
The national treasure’s colour plates unclothed and raised \n
like a priest praying over those in need of saving. \n
Wings not beating yet suspended in Heaven, no wires. \n
Red and yellow friction, two feathered fires \n
with muscles and faces bursting, above an innocent child. \n
Untyring angelic forces do battle for sovereigns claim. \n
The boy slumped but kneeling, pitiable crude suffering \n
while all about - a pulpy mouth shaped halo kissing him \n
and wet slobby anchoring, a silver thread suspended \n
to a mouth and a man \n
who will never touch someone’s baby \n
without being apprehended. \n
Saliva flapping, as the spirit within intrudes \n
“Is your guardian true, and loving? ” \n
At the barrier, something stirs unguessed. \n
Three orange plastic bags clutched tight to chest \n
like over-burdened maternity breasts, nurturing. \n
Now forced to pause, a smutty laugh leaks out - \n
memories of an adult magazine cartoon, \n
and sperm, blindly thrusting, swimming. \n
As another sperm wiggles through the tight checkout \n
the adolescent boy experiences a moment of doubt. \n
But I enter the cavernous warmth beyond \n
basket akimbo though bouncing no baby, \n
and aware of no dirt on the glass of my soul \n
nor self irony. \n
Shelves as deep as hills repeating in the distance \n
searching without risking, sound and worthy, press on. \n
Suppressed, a hurt deep within, a Freudian fantasim \n
that reaches out to the fertile shelves, passing \n
from angry wife and mother, to soft gentle sweater \n
from repellent abrasive son, to computer Gameboy optimism. \n
Bustle and tinsel, confident stride, what? \n
Trapped by a blue-white deformed reflection \n
in beer freezer metal mirror, highlighting. \n
Just did not suspect, tainted breath, reviling back \n
slip splutter, red raw gash, the floor spinning, \n
head then chest crushed by the expelling aisle. \n
Vaulted contractions pushing purple extremities, reversion. \n
A child’s pleading eyes look-up, \n
happiness seeking, open, feeling \n
but pointless, premature \n
without the fresh beginning, of forgiveness, no healing. \n

ghazal \n
In my life there is room after room of good things \n
my man is one room for whom thanks-I-am-giving. \n
I do not know what good seeds I have been sowing \n
but for not reaping from my bad deeds thanks-I-am-giving. \n
Every day my life kite through the sky is tripping \n
and through good times and bad times is zipping but thanks-I-am-giving. \n
The morning breeze a brand new essence is bringing \n
and blessings like flowers are budding and blooming and thanks-I-am giving. \n
When adventure comes a-horseback and hoofbeats are reigning \n
then the hills are ringing and singing with thanks-I-am-giving. \n

ghazal \n
You smile sweetheart many flowers sprung, \n
Wordsworth and Shelley and Keats are sung. \n
Tide of beauty brings out many pearls, \n
Ugliness sweeps out like dirt and dung. \n
My days are yours my nights are yours, \n
You are a song round the clock it's sung. \n
I remember sweetheart a heart I had, \n
With your earrings something is hung. \n
I cannot see if your eyes are wet, \n
My heart with you, see never it's wrung. \n<|endoftext|>
ghazal \n
Fly like a kite in the passion of storms, \n
Why don't you love and enjoy its charms. \n
Sink yourself in the ocean of two eyes, \n
Life is between two lovely soft arms. \n
Kiss smile of roses that blossom on her face, \n
Kiss line of love in the pair of her palms. \n
Those in love are nice gentlemen, \n
If one is deprived he loses his norms. \n
Kiss the mirror while watching your face, \n
Love is a beauty whatever may its forms. \n
Why are you burning in the fire of hate? \n
Look at the ashes of the melting norms. \n
Get rid of hate it's a friend you need, \n
See magic of love that a friend performs. \n
Forgive your enemy send a bouquet to him, \n
Melt ice of the past with a gift that warms. \n
Message of Christmas is help and service, \n
Icing of the cake is love that warms. \n
At least exchange few words that are pleasant, \n
It's eve of Christmas bid farewell to the arms. \n<|endoftext|>

ghazal \n
The word of Love is nothing but allusion. \n
Love is not bound by poetic metaphors. \n
The heart recognises the jewel of Love. \n
Reason has no inkling of this insight. \n
Love doesn't reside in interpretation. \n
Love isn't of the world of explanations. \n
Whoever has had a heart ruined by Love \n
afterwards will never know reconstruction. \n
Take a loan of Love and sell yourself \n
for there is no trade fairer that this. \n
If one moment passes by without Love \n
that moment will never find redemption. \n
Retrieve your heart from the grave of your desire. \n
Your heart won't receive any other visits. \n
Wash your body with the blood of your eyes. \n
Your body shall have no other cleansing. \n
Both worlds are filled with the Friend, and yet \n
there's no indication of Her Venus. \n
As She plundered the hearts of Her devotees \n
a cry arose: This isn't the place for pillage! \n
Give up your body for this task O Attār \n
because our vocation bears no malice. \n<|endoftext|>
ghazal \n
Hindustan belongs to me and Pakistan belongs to me \n
Both of these, however, are under American hegemony \n
American aid gave us wheat, as also their deceit \n
Do not ask me how long we’ve suffered their conceit \n
And yet the bayonets are all around this flowering valley \n
Hindustan belongs to me and Pakistan belongs to me \n
Khan Bahadur, do not follow the English, from them better keep away \n
Once again they are holding you by the collar, you are still their prey \n
Macmillan was never thine, Kennedy can never be \n
Hindustan belongs to me and Pakistan belongs to me \n
This land in fact, my dear, belongs to peasants and workers \n
Here will not run the writ of a few clannish marauders \n
The dawn of freedom is heralding the end of tyranny \n
Hindustan belongs to me and Pakistan belongs to me. \n

ghazal \n
When a voice is not heard it's nicely seen, \n
When ears are inactive my eyes are keen. \n
In all my senses it's touch instrumental, \n
Sixth sense of the soul is a touch unseen. \n
How bold is your heart my shy beloved! \n
Heard all untold and I saw the unseen. \n
Language of love is truly universal, \n
The body language celebrates Halloween. \n
Long hairs when silky and perfumed as well, \n
Comb of fingers learns how to preen. \n
I asked you agreed no words exchanged, \n
I never knew so simple it has been. \n
So all the senses touched her at last, \n
Spectrum of life is pink and green. \n
In a moonlit night that was cloudy and wet, \n
Princess was crowned as the ruling queen. \n<|endoftext|>

ghazal \n
Where to begin and then end this saga of stone; \n
On Mt. Sinai with the Ten Commandments of stone? \n
With the mighty megaliths of Britain’s Stonehenge? \n
Start we will from the beginning when there was stone. \n
Centuries ago some built fires in caves of stone; \n
Drew wild animals and hunters on walls of stone. \n
On dark nights some read moving stars, measured the moon; \n
And for each month some chose a special precious stone. \n
Behold the pyramids and amphitheaters \n
Enduring the centuries - monuments of stone. \n
Nothing is more lasting than a flat slab of rock; \n
Why streams flow along many pebbled beds of stone. \n
As people reborn some live the life of the Son; \n
His stone from the tomb found rolled back on Easter morn. \n
Relieving us all of weariness in our bones, \n
Fateful death lays us low at the foot of a stone. \n
Content will I be with B. J. G. chiseled there \n
While forever reposing in that outer zone. \n

lay \n
We will lay our summer away, my friend, \n
So tenderly lay it away. \n
It was bright and sweet to the very end, \n
Like one long, golden day. \n
Nothing sweeter could come to me, \n
Nothing sweeter to you. \n
We will lay it away, and let it be, \n
Hid from the whole world’s view. \n
We will lay it away like a dear, dead thing – \n
Dead, yet for ever fair; \n
And the fresh green robes of a deathless spring, \n
Though dead, it shall alaways wear. \n
We will not hide it in grave or tomb, \n
But lay it away to sleep, \n
Guarded by beauty, and light, and bloom, \n
Wrapped in a slumber deep. \n
We were willing to let the summer go – \n
Willing to go our own ways; \n
But never on earth again I know \n
Will either find such days. \n
You are my friend, and it may seem strange, \n
But I would not see you again; \n
I would think of you, though all things change, \n
Just as I knew you then. \n
If we should go back to the olden place, \n
And the summer time went too, \n
It would be like looking a ghost in the face, \n
So much would be changed and new. \n
We cannot live it over again, \n
Not even a single day; \n
And as something sweet, and free from pain, \n
We had better let it away. \n<|endoftext|>

LONG time I lay in little ease \n
Where, placed by the Turanian, \n
Marseilles, the many-masted, sees \n
The blue Mediterranean. \n
Now songful in the hour of sport, \n
Now riotous for wages, \n
She camps around her ancient port, \n
As ancient of the ages. \n
Algerian airs through all the place \n
Unconquerably sally; \n
Incomparable women pace \n
The shadows of the alley. \n
And high o'er dark and graving yard \n
And where the sky is paler, \n
The golden virgin of the guard \n
Shines, beckoning the sailor. \n
She hears the city roar on high, \n
Thief, prostitute, and banker; \n
She sees the masted vessels lie \n
Immovably at anchor. \n
She sees the snowy islets dot \n
The sea's immortal azure, \n
And If, that castellated spot, \n
Tower, turret, and embrasure. \n<|endoftext|>

One morning of the first sad Fall, \n
Poor Adam and his bride \n
Sat in the shade of Eden's wall-- \n
But on the outer side. \n
She, blushing in her fig-leaf suit \n
For the chaste garb of old; \n
He, sighing o'er his bitter fruit \n
For Eden's drupes of gold. \n
Behind them, smiling in the morn, \n
Their forfeit garden lay, \n
Before them, wild with rock and thorn, \n
The desert stretched away. \n
They heard the air above them fanned, \n
A light step on the sward, \n
And lo! they saw before them stand \n
The angel of the Lord! \n
'Arise,' he said, 'why look behind, \n
When hope is all before, \n
And patient hand and willing mind, \n
Your loss may yet restore? \n
'I leave with you a spell whose power \n
Can make the desert glad, \n
And call around you fruit and flower \n
As fair as Eden had. \n
'I clothe your hands with power to lift \n
The curse from off your soil; \n
Your very doom shall seem a gift, \n
Your loss a gain through Toil. \n
'Go, cheerful as yon humming-bees, \n
To labor as to play.' \n
White glimmering over Eden's trees \n
The angel passed away. \n
The pilgrims of the world went forth \n
Obedient to the word, \n
And found where'er they tilled the earth \n
A garden of the Lord! \n
The thorn-tree cast its evil fruit \n
And blushed with plum and pear, \n
And seeded grass and trodden root \n
Grew sweet beneath their care. \n
We share our primal parents' fate, \n
And, in our turn and day, \n
Look back on Eden's sworded gate \n
As sad and lost as they. \n
But still for us his native skies \n
The pitying Angel leaves, \n
And leads through Toil to Paradise \n
New Adams and new Eves! \n<|endoftext|>
lay \n
To the solemn abyss leads the terrible path, \n
The life and death winding dizzy between; \n
In thy desolate way, grim with menace and wrath, \n
To daunt thee the spectres of giants are seen; \n
That thou wake not the wild one, all silently tread-- \n
Let thy lip breathe no breath in the pathway of dread! \n
High over the marge of the horrible deep \n
Hangs and hovers a bridge with its phantom-like span, \n
Not by man was it built, o'er the vastness to sweep; \n
Such thought never came to the daring of man! \n
The stream roars beneath--late and early it raves-- \n
But the bridge, which it threatens, is safe from the waves. \n
Black-yawning a portal, thy soul to affright, \n
Like the gate to the kingdom, the fiend for the king-- \n
Yet beyond it there smiles but a land of delight, \n
Where the autumn in marriage is met with the spring. \n
From a lot which the care and the trouble assail, \n
Could I fly to the bliss of that balm-breathing vale! \n
Through that field, from a fount ever hidden their birth, \n
Four rivers in tumult rush roaringly forth; \n
They fly to the fourfold divisions of earth-- \n
The sunrise, the sunset, the south, and the north. \n
And, true to the mystical mother that bore, \n
Forth they rush to their goal, and are lost evermore. \n
High over the races of men in the blue \n
Of the ether, the mount in twin summits is riven; \n
There, veiled in the gold-woven webs of the dew, \n
Moves the dance of the clouds--the pale daughters of heaven! \n
There, in solitude, circles their mystical maze, \n
Where no witness can hearken, no earthborn surveys. \n
August on a throne which no ages can move, \n
Sits a queen, in her beauty serene and sublime, \n
The diadem blazing with diamonds above \n
The glory of brows, never darkened by time, \n
His arrows of light on that form shoots the sun-- \n
And he gilds them with all, but he warms them with none! \n<|endoftext|>

LAY not reproach at the drunkard's door \n
Oh Fanatic, thou that art pure of soul; \n
Not thine on the page of life to enrol \n
The faults of others! Or less or more \n
I have swerved from my path--keep thou to thine own \n
For every man when he reaches the goal \n
Shall reap the harvest his hands have sown. \n
Leave me the hope of a former grace-- \n
Till the curtain is lifted none can tell \n
Whether in Heaven or deepest Hell, \n
Fair or vile, shall appear his face. \n
Alike the drunk and the strict of fare \n
For his mistress yearns--in the mosque Love doth dwell \n
And the church, for his lodging is everywhere. \n
If without the house of devotion I stand, \n
I am not the first to throw wide the door \n
My father opened it long before, \n
The eternal Paradise slipped from his hand. \n
All you that misconstrue my words' intent, \n
I lie on the bricks of the tavern floor, \n
And a brick shall serve me for argument. \n
Heaven's garden future treasures may yield-- \n
Ah, make the most of earth's treasury! \n
The flickering shade of the willow-tree, \n
And the grass-grown lip of the fruitful field. \n
Trust not in deeds--the Eternal Day \n
Shall reveal the Creator's sentence on thee; \n
But till then, what His finger has writ, who can say. \n
Bring the cup in thine hand to the Judgment-seat; \n
Thou shalt rise, oh Hafiz, to Heaven's gate \n
From the tavern where thou hast tarried late. \n
And if thou hast worshipped wine, thou shalt meet \n
The reward that the Faithful attain; \n
If such thy life, then fear not thy fate, \n
Thou shalt not have lived and worshipped in vain. \n<|endoftext|>

Venturing out, I came across the wind. \n
Who, rushing, coldheartedly waved hello \n
Making me feel like Adam when he sinned \n
Such that I wished he’d ignored me- but no… \n
Instead, like Jack Frost, he icily grinned \n
And his nature he decided to show. \n
He came from the north - forty miles, at least \n
Found his way through shirt, sweeter and coat \n
At the end leaving me like a skinned beast: \n
One left to eventually die and bloat. \n
This wind certainly was death’s own high priest; \n
For the harshest, he surely has my vote! \n

Tonight over the sea there are small lights, \n
Cape Town against Table Mountain lying bright \n
where it is flat against the evening sky \n
and in the distance a liner passes by \n
while the surging spray breaks over False Bay, \n
forevermore on Africa waves toss and play. \n
The stream of life did into the sea go \n
with joy, grace and hope in its ebb and flow \n
but debris, broken pieces are washed ashore \n
with pollution caught in the breaking roar \n
while the surging spray breaks over False Bay, \n
forevermore on Africa waves toss and play. \n
Stars sparkle and the light wind furls through your hair \n
while on the beach we are the only pair \n
and you swear to be true eternally, \n
a bright beacon in the darkness we see \n
while the surging spray breaks over False Bay, \n

The heavens closed; refusing to rain \n
The insects take all for their dinner \n
Whilst seedlings die, and do not give grain. \n

A heart’s sacred trust \n
Fragile and easily bruised \n
Murder of the soul \n
Sheltered by walls of numbness \n
Condemned to a living death \n
A life with no soul \n
The pained motion of living \n
No one understands \n
A beggar at mercy’s door \n
Heart and soul long to be healed \n
Child of innocence \n
No longer is the soul pure \n
Desperately seeking \n
Fervently searching for soul \n
Seeking warm sanctuary \n
Longing for answers \n
Shell of what was once living \n
Utter emptiness \n
Hiding from the sight of God \n
Yearning for a safe haven \n
Child of the shadows \n
Seeking ways out of darkness \n
Starving for the light \n
Darkness is more familiar \n
Invisible from our sight \n
Bruises unnoticed \n
Such tormented innocence \n
Self is shamed away \n
Tainted by the sins of man \n

Shining in the light \n
Through Him all things possible \n

A new path lit by God's love \n
Loved unconditionally \n
Out of the shadows \n
Behold, the new child of God \n
Sacred trust restored \n
A new measure of balance \n
New path of truth, love, and light \n
Welcome this new day \n
Divine child shines with the light \n
Safe haven is found \n
Deep love from salvation’s hand \n
Rendered to this world in peace \n

Renga With Richard - Poem by GORDON GILHULY \n
the blue of twilight \n
like a soft unspoken hope: \n
the singed moon waiting \n
lucid dreams now revealing \n
the mysteries of one's life \n
we are the Moirai: \n
singing souls of the journey's \n
eternal circle \n
we are the mystical three \n
spinning mother thread of life \n
no one may alter \n
the destinies we ordain - \n
not even the gods \n
Zeus our god and leader \n
Like man must submit to us \n
I, Clotho, sing all \n
things that are, spin the thread of \n
life that marks your days \n
I, Lachesis, ration life \n
I, Atropos, Shadow Death \n
hear us, mortals, sing \n
in terrible unison, \n
of your destiny \n
I, Lachesis, belt out past \n
I, Clotho intone present \n
now the end days draw \n
near: the gods amuse themselves \n
with death, fire and rain \n
the mortals' days are numbered \n
Planet Earth in turmoil \n
your children fed to \n
the guns of madmen - caissons \n
stand at the school door \n
ready for Armageddon \n
Jesus and Satan at war \n

This is a co-operative renga written with Richard W. I wrote the 5-7-5 hokku and Richard wrote the 7-7 waki. I would send one hokku and he would build on that with a waki. Then my next hokku had to connect with waki etc. This was fun and we recommend that other PH users try it. \n

rondeau \n
Epitaph \n
Here there lies, and sleeps in the grave, \n
One whom Love killed with his scorn, \n
A poor little scholar in every way, \n
He was named François Villon. \n
He never reaped a morsel of corn: \n
Willed all away, as all men know: \n
Bed, table, and basket all are gone. \n
Gallants, now sing his song below: \n
Rondeau \n
Oh, grant him now eternal peace, \n
Lord, and everlasting light, \n
He wasn't worth a candle bright, \n
Nor even a sprig of parsley. \n
Of eyebrows, hair, and beard he's free, \n
A turnip scraped with a spade, all right: \n
Oh, grant him now eternal peace. \n
Exiled with strict severity, \n
Rapped behind with a spade, despite \n
It all he cried: ‘Appeal, for me!' \n
- Which wasn't the height of subtlety. \n
Oh, grant him now eternal peace. \n<|endoftext|>
rondeau \n
And when it’s done, the prisoners rake \n
the blasted rock aside, and take \n
up chisel, pick and sledge to prise \n
a railway through a limestone rise \n
for Emperor Hirohito’s sake. \n
It’s hell, and one in three don’t make \n
it home, and some survivors quake \n
when spectres fly until they die \n
and when it’s done. \n
Hibiscus, teak and fig trees stake \n
the wound, and forty monsoons slake \n
a green ferment, but men reprise \n
the Pass, and tourists wonder why \n
they just feel numb when all’s opaque \n
and when it’s done. \n<|endoftext|>
rondeau \n
Silence tightly, tugs- \n
We lose contact, it unplugs. \n
Disconnected I still wonder \n
your way. Loving still tender, \n
But bliss still lags. \n
Polluted by pain I lost my legs- \n
Looking at you blow away the ground pegs \n
Me here- As you surrender, \n
Silence tightly, tugs. \n
Sweet now sour, fruits now figs- \n
All to waste like rotting eggs \n
Was it love we fear, \n
Or luck we lack, my dear? \n
Our only findings: \n
Silence tightly, tugs. \n<|endoftext|>
rondeau \n
Last night I saw a big white moon \n
rising slowly, almost with dignity \n
and the first star said that it would be dark soon \n
while you kissed me \n
and together we lay spoon to spoon \n
melted into each other softly and tenderly, \n
in loving activity without any modesty. \n
Last night I saw a big white moon \n
somewhat magical like in a fairy cartoon \n
and outside the wind blowing was the only activity \n
but you had awoken my harpoon \n
rising slowly, almost with dignity \n
while you were smiling in glee \n
and for a moment I felt like a king or a tycoon \n
while in joy and passion we were free \n
and the first star said that it would be dark soon \n
before everything fell swoon, \n
we were feeling almost unconscious and you were lovely \n
when I jokingly pulled my face like that of a buffoon, \n
while you kissed me \n
and later I heard you croon \n
a sentimental song while displaying your breasts carelessly \n
and I wished to be in bed with you until noon \n
loving you as sweetly and remembering permanently: \n
last night. \n<|endoftext|>
rondeau \n
Queensland summer strays in to scuttle Spring. \n
Dissolve its breath; no more its song to sing. \n
Time now for us to return to the sound of the sea, \n
its jests, its restless passion, and gypsy-free \n
follow the gulls, our hearts like theirs on the wing. \n
For an hour or two each day together we'll bring \n
books, umbrella: in silent thought we'll fling \n
last year's old cares, content on Nature's knee. \n
Queensland summer. \n
We'll swim on the jelly waves and turn to swing \n
and stretch our bodies on the breakers' long white string. \n
Watch children build sandcastles, two or three. \n
Watch walkers stride the sand like you and me \n
until the Fall sweeps in with its sighing sting. \n
Queensland summer. \n<|endoftext|>
rondeau \n
Finish these langours! Oh! I'm sick \n
Of dying airs, I know the trick; \n
Long since I've learn'd to well explain \n
Th'unmeaning cant of fire and pain, \n
And see through all the senseless lies \n
Of burning darts from killing eyes; \n
I'm tir'd with this continual rout \n
Of bowing low and leading out. \n
Finish, &c. \n
Finish this tedious dangling trade, \n
By which so many fools are made; \n
For fools they are, whom you can please \n
By such affected airs as these: \n
At opera near my box to stand, \n
And slyly press the given hand, \n
Thus may you wait whole years in vain; \n
But sure you would, were you in pain. \n
Finish, &c. \n<|endoftext|>
rondeau \n
You came to me in serenity as someone beautiful and gay, \n
that morning was hot full of sunshine and bright \n
and all my fears and tears were swept away \n
while you stayed right through the night. \n
You were happy, and it was sheer magic despite \n
the stupid things that I did at times say, \n
before we laid next to the glowing firelight. \n
You came to me in serenity as someone beautiful and gay, \n
where we looked at the wind on the lake in rippling circles play \n
while the waves were very tiny and without might \n
on a tranquil, calm awesome day, \n
that morning was hot full of sunshine and bright \n
with doves fluttering in their cooing flight \n
and in the sky there was nothing black or grey, \n
only the sparkling bluest sight \n
and all my fears and tears were swept away. \n
When a storm had risen with foaming spray, \n
with gigantic waves crushing threatening and white, \n
something special happened on a rainy winter day in May \n
while you stayed right through the night. \n
My love here now I give you my plight, \n
that even if from me you do stray \n
if you somehow run away in fright \n
I will still remember and say: \n
you came to me in serenity. \n<|endoftext|>
rondeau \n
To Couto de Barros (1924) \n
From you, Rose, I do not like \n
To accept only this slow hug \n
That you this moist kiss \n
That you give me… \n
I do not for a single reason: \n
From everything you tell me \n
I see that in your breast \n
Sobs the well-made heart \n
of you. \n
And then I imagine \n
That together with the slender body \n
The dark little body \n
That you give me \n
Together with your loveliness \n
The maddening charm and laughter \n
That you give me \n
It would be something if I too owned \n
What hides behind your face, Rose: \n
The thought, the soul, the grief \n
of you. \n<|endoftext|>

Ah, Manon, say, why is it we \n
Are one and all so fain of thee? \n
Thy rich red beauty debonnaire \n
In very truth is not more fair, \n
Than the shy grace and purity \n
That clothe the maiden maidenly; \n
Her gray eyes shine more tenderly \n
And not less bright than thine her hair; \n
Ah, Manon, say! \n
Expound, I pray, the mystery \n
Why wine-stained lip and languid eye, \n
And most unsaintly Maenad air, \n
Should move us more than all the rare \n
White roses of virginity? \n

This airy cage is foliage lined. \n
Its supple bars are intertwined. \n
The women show me where to tread. \n
I pluck and spin a cotton thread. \n
My woven home is hardwood spined. \n
The roots have poison deep confined. \n
We boil and dry before we grind. \n
I chew the bread but hope has fled \n
this airy cage. \n
The long flute's low hum numbs my mind. \n
A line of dancers slowly wind. \n
Their skins are painted black and red. \n
A shaman waves a shrunken head. \n

rondeau \n
(for Annelize) \n
I remember you in that summer so happy and gay, \n
from early morning the sun was high and bright \n
but now my love, from me you are away. \n
Lonely I look at the stars in the night \n
while destiny do people against me incite \n
but without you my world falls apart and unsteady sway \n
and where with summer's beauty the days are bedight \n
I remember you in that summer so happy and gay, \n
how the wind did as white horses with the waves play, \n
that rainy winter caught in a tempest storm's might \n
and then again with you smiling on another sunny day. \n
From early morning the sun was high and bright \n
on the beach at the Strand we saw gulls in their flight, \n
our St. Bernard George ran up and down and sea was grey \n
and when a freakish wave uncovered you, you were a sight \n
but now my love, from me you are away. \n
At times on the beach the wind was full of spray \n
and almost endless that beach was white \n
where those times were as happy as they may. \n
Lonely I look at the stars in the night \n
and solitary without you is my plight \n
while out of each other's lives we do stray \n
but to me you are my love and my light \n
and I hope that these few words say: \n
I remember you. \n

So charmingly she was violet-eyed. \n
As an actress, she was a movie star. \n
As Isis, she has been really portrayed \n
For the world, built by the triple pillar. \n
She found that her time work was amazing \n
In "aeternum", she searched for her own light. \n
Wanting to be all, her voice was raising \n
So charmingly; she was violet-eyed. \n
While filming National Velvet, her heart \n
Vibrated like a string of a guitar. \n
To Judaism, Liz wanted to convert. \n
As an actress, she was a movie star. \n
In the dawn's light, she was full of finesse. \n
An immaculatetalent she remained. \n
Endowed with a genial consciousness, \n
As Isis, she has been really portrayed. \n
She played in the Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. \n
'Ab initio', she has been a star \n
In Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf - \n
The world, built by the family pillar. \n
As the best actress, she won an Oscar. \n
In Butterfield, she was magnificent. \n
She had A Place in the Sun as a star. \n
Her name will always be significant- \n
So charmingly... \n

rondeau \n
Echoes breathe deep 'neath Church steeples, \n
wind warped chimes chase spiral pathways, \n
stations, novenas, the Passion and the Death. \n
Funeral's tend to cumber heavy hearts \n
choke the lungs from the grief and organ. \n
Myrrh stings the eyes like darning needles, \n
spiraled smoke dances 'round gothic lamps; \n
the starched 'March of Death' sleeps below them, \n
as Echoes breathe deep, sore unlaboured, \n
while mourners sit in pews profusely sweating. \n
Morning sun bleeds heavy through stained glass. \n
'Resurrection' Masses tend to cause discomfit, \n
leave grey, hollow hearts in deep bereft; \n
thank God for the cool steeple breeze; \n
when echoes breathe deep...in wake of the dead. \n

And I had to sail far from the lee \n
Toward a high and mad sea… \n
I saw you turning back \n
Waving to another man \n
Holding hands \n
And strolling on the sand. \n
I was reaching for the ocean floor \n
Of you soul \n
While all you could do \n
Is to go \n
To the backyard \n
Picking roses \n
Even though \n
I tried hard \n
To see through your clothes \n
If there's more than flesh \n
That's to be relished \n
And then at dawn \n
Is to be thrown \n
As a leftover dish. \n
And I didn't want to believe \n
That that's all \n
But only you built a wall \n

A round your soul \n
Barring a thief \n
Like me \n
To take his dole. \n<|endoftext|>

His_Story selective surrendered with a sigh \n
shaking, quaking caverns felt doom's gloom whistle by \n
sad Earth's secret centres soared skywards in cascade. \n

by stretchers plagued day in day out. Parked there to die, \n
conscripts fought while Colonels caught some Staff advancement's eye \n
preparing for fiasco in 1940 played. \n
Shells shattered ears, hell shuttered eyes, fragile half-life decayed. \n
Shells scattered tears, knelled stuttered cries, crossfire made lonely maid. \n
The ‘Last Great War' once over, glad tidings were relayed, \n
victory crowns in towns cheered Palace balustrade, \n

bottled brains in Britain bragged how they'd steady stayed. \n
But in "land of heroes", though ranks earned accolade, \n
while most must meals measure, the few in leisure layed. \n
Some carved while soldiers starved, highlighting masquarade! \n
Uniforms that won fair maid were worn, drawn fringes frayed, \n
with chip by chip paint torn from weather-worn façade. \n
What hair still peeked from cap that peaked showed streaks of care woe greyed. \n
Instead of fragile faces, poppies bloom on parade. \n

No victory can last unless fresh ones are earned. \n<|endoftext|>

imagery \n
I was touring the lovely countryside, once on a golden Saturday, \n
Lost within the raptures, of languid summertime's scenic display. \n
And I came into the vicinity, of a beautiful historic old home, \n
So being curious and interested, inside I occasioned to roam. \n
Excitedly I wandered about, exploring the grandeur everywhere, \n
And when done down below, I climbed the burgundy carpeted stairs. \n
In awe of its splendor and beauty, I viewed the portrait hall, \n
As many proud faces of yesterday, then held me in their thrall! \n
The esteemed personages peered down, in all of dignity and grace, \n
As if the past yet lived, in this proud and historic old place. \n
And the sun had not yet set, on the glory of their gladsome days, \n
For sweet memory lives on, in a multitude of mysterious ways! \n
Curious to see more below, I descended the plush velvet stair; \n
And entered an odd hall of mirrors, with gilded frames so rare. \n
At the end of the red carpeted hall, a huge doorway led outside; \n
And windows let in late daylight, on each of the opposing sides. \n
Having ended a charming tour, I left by the nearest handy route, \n
Which was the doorway that ended, Mirror Hall without a dispute. \n
Once out in the cool evening, I saw the sun setting in the east; \n
The scenery was reversed as well, very shocking to say the least! \n
The flowers once blooming on the left, now bloomed upon my right. \n
I could not make sense of it, though I tried with all my might. \n
The doors to the home were now locked, with no way to get back in, \n
And no reversing of my steps, to see if logic would return again. \n
All I could do was locate my car, after which I returned home. \n
If only I'd stayed there today, I'd not be in reversal syndrome! \n
On the return drive the route, and scenery were all so familiar, \n
Only located in the exact opposite, direction of what I remember. \n
After a refreshing supper, I slept peacefully through the night; \n
And I awoke to gay sunshine, with no clue how to end my plight. \n
When I looked into my mirror, my right side was now on my left, \n
And I gazed at myself in wonder, too astonished to feel bereft! \n
So I reported to my job at Nasa, not sure what else I could do, \n
Like the birds that feel at home, in whatever skies are true blue! \n
At my job as an astronaut, I learned writing was done differently- \n
It was performed right to left, and not in the way of my memory! \n
This made reading newspapers and books, a bit more of a challenge, \n
But it was a rewarding task, like peeling a sweet spicy orange. \n
East was now west and north was south, while left became the right; \n
And different stars winked from above, all throughout the night! \n
I was chosen to go on a mission, to explore the Red Planet, Mars, \n
A planet now in a different cosmic location, in proximity to ours. \n
The mission was a huge success, and an incredibly unique adventure, \n
For beholding the vast universe in reverse, was a memory I treasure! \n
Back on earth I enjoyed dancing, though the steps were different, \n
They were opposite to what one would expect, though still current. \n
I visited an art museum, and was beguiled with Mona Lisa's smile, \n
For instead of facing to the left, she now faced right with style! \n
My family and all the people I knew, were still exactly the same, \n
Except they belonged to another universe, beyond the silver acclaim! \n
Birds now flew north for winter, and sang all through saffron days, \n
Trilling their sweet love songs, as summer went by in fiery blaze. \n
Despite the charm of this new world, I really longed to go home, \n
Like the traveler who ever returns, to a place he's most well known. \n
My only idea was to return again, to the place this mystery began, \n
So back to the historic home I went, and this time I drove my van. \n
Instinctively I knew that I must, reenter again through Mirror Hall, \n
Like Cinderella fleeing the ball, before coming to a graceless fall! \n
The door was fortuitously open, and I immediately slipped inside, \n
Antsy that capriciousness of place, might take me on a new wild ride. \n
I returned to the velvet staircase, and asked about the hall of mirrors, \n
The attendant said there was no such hall today, nor in previous years! \n
Aghast, I quickly turned around, but no hall of mirrors could be seen, \n
Which made me pause and ask myself, just where in the world had I been? \n
Several years have quickly gone, and I've learned not to question why, \n
For some things have no answers, and as years go, mysteries multiply! \n<|endoftext|>

CALL for the robin-redbreast and the wren, \n
Since o'er shady groves they hover, \n
And with leaves and flowers do cover \n
The friendless bodies of unburied men. \n
Call unto his funeral dole \n
The ant, the field-mouse, and the mole, \n
To rear him hillocks that shall keep him warm, \n
And (when gay tombs are robb'd) sustain no harm; \n
But keep the wolf far thence, that 's foe to men, \n
For with his nails he'll dig them up again. \n<|endoftext|>
dirge \n
In the greater oyster world \n
All the children eventually grew old \n
The windmills ran down \n
The fields went back to clover \n
The stones kept all their secrets \n
Waterways forgot their courses \n
The sundials were covered with moss \n
And time eventually stretched out \n
To touch the edge of infinity. \n<|endoftext|>
dirge \n
No more will we stumble and fall \n
On the sand at Portobello beach \n
Rolling in laughter \n
In love and in happiness. \n
No more will we stumble and fall \n
By the canal and the bushes \n
That May in Amsterdam \n
In fun and bliss. \n
No more will we stumble and fall \n
Reckless into each others hearts \n
As the bed fell apart \n
And we crashed and slept in chaos! \n
No more will we stumble and fall \n
Drunk in the winter snow \n
Wild and free as the wind \n
When Joy and Love were new. \n
No more shall we stumble and fall \n
Where all defenses are broken \n
Where love rushes in like the tide \n
When your eyes were my heaven \n<|endoftext|>

Toll Nelson's knell! a soul more brave \n
Ne'er triumphed on the green-sea wave! \n
Sad o'er the hero's honoured grave, \n
Toll Nelson's knell! \n
The ball of Death unerring flew; \n
His cheek has lost its ardent hue; \n
He sinks, amid his gallant crew! \n
Toll Nelson's knell! \n
Yet lift, brave chief, thy dying eyes; \n
Hark! loud huzzas around thee rise; \n
Aloft the flag of conquest flies! \n
The day is won! \n
The day is won--peace to the brave! \n
But whilst the joyous streamers wave, \n
We'll think upon the victor's grave! \n
Peace to the brave! \n<|endoftext|>

Vapours, sighs, darken the day! \n
Our dole more deadly looks than dying; \n
Balms and gums and heavy cheers, \n
Sacred vials fill'd with tears, \n
And clamours through the wild air flying! \n

dirge \n
Come pity us, all ye who see \n
Our harps hung on the willow-tree; \n
Come pity us, ye passers-by, \n
Who see or hear poor widows' cry; \n
Come pity us, and bring your ears \n
And eyes to pity widows' tears. \n
CHOR. And when you are come hither, \n
Then we will keep \n
A fast, and weep \n
Our eyes out all together, \n
For Tabitha; who dead lies here, \n
Clean wash'd, and laid out for the bier. \n
O modest matrons, weep and wail! \n
For now the corn and wine must fail; \n
The basket and the bin of bread, \n
Wherewith so many souls were fed, \n
CHOR. Stand empty here for ever; \n
And ah! the poor, \n
At thy worn door, \n
Shall be relieved never. \n
Woe worth the time, woe worth the day, \n
That reft us of thee, Tabitha! \n
For we have lost, with thee, the meal, \n
The bits, the morsels, and the deal \n
Of gentle paste and yielding dough, \n
That thou on widows did bestow. \n
CHOR. All's gone, and death hath taken \n
Away from us \n
Our maundy; thus \n
Thy widows stand forsaken. \n
Ah, Dorcas, Dorcas! now adieu \n
We bid the cruise and pannier too; \n
Ay, and the flesh, for and the fish, \n
Doled to us in that lordly dish. \n
We take our leaves now of the loom \n
From whence the housewives' cloth did come; \n
CHOR. The web affords now nothing; \n
Thou being dead, \n
The worsted thread \n
Is cut, that made us clothing. \n
Farewell the flax and reaming wool, \n
With which thy house was plentiful; \n
Farewell the coats, the garments, and \n
The sheets, the rugs, made by thy hand; \n
Farewell thy fire and thy light, \n
That ne'er went out by day or night:-- \n
CHOR. No, or thy zeal so speedy, \n
That found a way, \n
By peep of day, \n
To feed and clothe the needy. \n
But ah, alas! the almond-bough \n
And olive-branch is wither'd now; \n
The wine-press now is ta'en from us, \n
The saffron and the calamus; \n
The spice and spikenard hence is gone, \n
The storax and the cinnamon; \n
CHOR. The carol of our gladness \n
Has taken wing; \n
And our late spring \n
Of mirth is turn'd to sadness. \n
How wise wast thou in all thy ways! \n
How worthy of respect and praise! \n
How matron-like didst thou go drest! \n
How soberly above the rest \n
Of those that prank it with their plumes, \n
And jet it with their choice perfumes! \n
CHOR. Thy vestures were not flowing; \n
Nor did the street \n
Accuse thy feet \n
Of mincing in their going. \n
And though thou here liest dead, we see \n
A deal of beauty yet in thee. \n
How sweetly shews thy smiling face, \n
Thy lips with all diffused grace! \n
Thy hands, though cold, yet spotless, white, \n
And comely as the chrysolite. \n
CHOR. Thy belly like a hill is, \n
Or as a neat \n
Clean heap of wheat, \n
All set about with lilies. \n
Sleep with thy beauties here, while we \n
Will shew these garments made by thee; \n
These were the coats; in these are read \n
The monuments of Dorcas dead: \n
These were thy acts, and thou shalt have \n
These hung as honours o'er thy grave:-- \n
CHOR. And after us, distressed, \n
Should fame be dumb, \n
Thy very tomb \n
Would cry out, Thou art blessed. \n<|endoftext|>

CALM on the bosom of thy God, \n
Fair spirit, rest thee now! \n
E'en while with ours thy footsteps trod, \n
His seal was on thy brow. \n

Soul, to its place on high! \n

dirge \n
The warm sun is falling, the bleak wind is wailing, \n
The bare boughs are sighing, the pale flowers are dying, \n
And the Year \n
On the earth is her death-bed, in a shroud of leaves dead, \n
Is lying. \n
Come, Months, come away, \n
From November to May, \n
In your saddest array; \n
Follow the bier \n
Of the dead cold Year, \n
And like dim shadows watch by her sepulchre. \n
The chill rain is falling, the nipped worm is crawling, \n
The rivers are swelling, the thunder is knelling \n
For the Year; \n
The blithe swallows are flown, and the lizards each gone \n
To his dwelling. \n
Come, Months, come away; \n
Put on white, black and gray; \n
Let your light sisters play-- \n
Ye, follow the bier \n
Of the dead cold Year, \n
And make her grave green with tear on tear. \n<|endoftext|>

‘In the cause of Right engaged \n
Wrongs injurious to redress \n
Honour’s war we strongly waged \n
But the Heaven’s GAVE Success! ’ \n
To the call the country rallied \n
Cullloden’s ghosts murmured there: \n
The Union Jack, a puppet sallied… \n
Yes! Independence, we shall dare! \n
Jack came on to the battle \n
Bloated fat on many a feast \n
His followers, like sheep and cattle \n
Dumbly stared, as if deceased. \n
None were clad in morals bold \n
Their intellect, as blunt old spears; \n
Lost humanity, bought and sold \n
For post and title down the years. \n
Age old Corruption, fast enslaved them \n
Up her ranks the worst befell \n
Grinning, fawning, as she saved them \n
Souls burning in the fires of Hell. \n
No more hope of full employment \n
No more plans to ban the bomb; \n
Embracing Greed’s emolument \n
From Iraq back to the Somme! \n
Shorn of principle and vision \n
Labour's hacks in droves they fell \n
Disdainful deals in dull derision \n
Their ranks broke pell mell. \n
Blair and Brown moved Jack's mouth \n
He only spoke by their command \n
Bankrupt ideas from the South \n
A puppet played by slight of hand. \n
Ambition’s price is war and death \n
Our leader’s most wicked error \n
Hear them lie with every breath \n
That they will save YOU from Terror. \n
Bush and Blair I do declare \n
Spawned the terrorist spore \n
In Freedom’s name I do despair \n
The new Cold War’s bloody gore. \n
‘Scotland once our boast, our wonder \n
Fann’d by Freedom’s purer gale \n
When thy Wallace, arm’d with thunder \n
Bade the baffled Tyrant’s wail! ’ \n
Rouse the rebel Scots to waken! \n

My Beloved Brother \n
(A Dirge) \n
Years ago you realised the truth, \n
The truth of futility, \n
Utter futility of life, \n
Between life and death without complex vision, \n
Putting life against death, \n
Taking life as hard food to digest. \n
Years ago you realised the truth, \n
The verity of the utter inefficacy \n
of the knowledge, \n
Of life and its Orotund Journey, \n
Taking death as an immediate choice, \n
Death was to you like an evanescent point, \n
Rivers fall into the vast expanse. \n
I was sad and even toady you are fresh like a bud, \n
Speaking to me in my subconscious \n
Nous, \n
Without guile you continue to speak, \n
You speak when the Sun is rising, \n
You speak when the dusk gleams, \n
You speak along and speak in my mind, \n
You speak without repentance and remorse. \n
I was sorrowful and distressed, \n
Not for the choice you made, \n
Thinking the mystic way about life and death, \n
The heavy load of pain was unbearable, \n
I was not a patron saint of life and its edge, \n
I was sad for pain that sealed my heart \n
for mystic Straits. \n
You went without notice, \n
Pushing with anguish in mind, \n
The heavy waves of life and dream profound, \n
From a strong tree of life, \n
a fresh bud of many possibilities, \n
You jumped into infinity, \n
drinking the Juice of death in single draught, \n
Life with all its attachments was nothing to you. \n
Years passed with pain and penance, \n
Looking at sky with wonderment, \n
With the sun I rise and with the sun I set, \n
The Moon is a living pain among mystic Stars, \n
On the milky way may be the subtle route, \n
May you walk with wonder-struck mind, \n
Kissing the dust of failure I nurture \n
my pain of losing you, \n
To me time has stopped to proceed. \n
I am with you with all my heart and being, \n
Pain is the bridge between two worlds \n
of different dosage, \n
I am the alpha and you are my omega, \n
You and me the full circle of life, \n
Only Lethe river between both of Us, \n
Sitting under the trees of knowledge \n
I watched you on the Cross \n
Wearing the crown of Thistle, \n
With blank eyes and Umpteen \n
and unuttered questions. \n
Blue sky is darkening now, \n
Heartbeat changes its rhythm, \n
Slow and steady breath is restless, \n
Within the womb of time I will be standing \n
to listen to your words, \n
The questions you left behind \n
Whispering like oak and pine, \n
I will be with you in no time. \n

dirge \n
'Dr. Birch's young friends will reassemble to-day, Feb. 1st.' \n
White is the wold, and ghostly \n
The dank and leafless trees; \n
And 'M's and 'N's are mostly \n
Pronounced like 'B's and 'D's: \n
'Neath bleak sheds, ice-encrusted, \n
The sheep stands, mute and stolid: \n
And ducks find out, disgusted, \n
That all the ponds are solid. \n
Many a stout steer's work is \n
(At least in this world) finished; \n
The gross amount of turkies \n
Is sensibly diminished: \n
The holly-boughs are faded, \n
The painted crackers gone; \n
Would I could write, as Gray did, \n
An Elegy thereon! \n
For Christmas-time is ended: \n
Now is 'our youth' regaining \n
Those sweet spots where are 'blended \n
Home-comforts and school-training.' \n
Now they're, I dare say, venting \n
Their grief in transient sobs, \n
And I am 'left lamenting' \n
At home, with Mrs. Dobbs. \n
O Posthumus! 'Fugaces \n
Labuntur anni' still; \n
Time robs us of our graces, \n
Evade him as we will. \n
We were the twins of Siam: \n
Now SHE thinks ME a bore, \n
And I admit that _I_ am \n
Inclined at times to snore. \n
I was her own Nathaniel; \n
With her I took sweet counsel, \n
Brought seed-cake for her spaniel, \n
And kept her bird in groundsel: \n
We've murmured, 'How delightful \n
A landscape, seen by night, is,' - \n
And woke next day in frightful \n
Pain from acute bronchitis. \n
But ah! for them, whose laughter \n
We heard last New Year's Day, - \n
(They reeked not of Hereafter, \n
Or what the Doctor'd say,) - \n
For those small forms that fluttered \n
Moth-like around the plate, \n
When Sally brought the buttered \n
Buns in at half-past eight! \n
Ah for the altered visage \n
Of her, our tiny Belle, \n
Whom my boy Gus (at his age!) \n
Said was a 'deuced swell!' \n
P'raps now Miss Tickler's tocsin \n
Has caged that pert young linnet; \n
Old Birch perhaps is boxing \n
My Gus's ears this minute. \n
Yet, though your young ears be as \n
Red as mamma's geraniums, \n
Yet grieve not! Thus ideas \n
Pass into infant craniums. \n
Use not complaints unseemly; \n
Tho' you must work like bricks; \n
And it IS cold, extremely, \n
Rising at half-past six. \n
Soon sunnier will the day grow, \n
And the east wind not blow so; \n
Soon, as of yore, L'Allegro \n
Succeed Il Penseroso: \n
Stick to your Magnall's Questions \n
And Long Division sums; \n
And come--with good digestions - \n
Home when next Christmas comes. \n<|endoftext|>
dirge \n
Ah me! \n
Am I the swain \n
That late from sorrow free \n
Did all the cares on earth disdain? \n
And still untouched, as at some safer games, \n
Played with the burning coals of love, and beauty's flames? \n
Was't I could dive, and sound each passion's secret depth at will? \n
And from those huge o'erwhelmings rise, by help of reason still? \n
And am I now, O heavens! for trying this in vain, \n
So sunk that I shall never rise again? \n
Then let despair set sorrow's string, \n
For strains that doleful be; \n
And I will sing, \n
Ah me! \n
But why, \n
O fatal time, \n
Dost thou constrain that I \n
Should perish in my youth's sweet prime? \n
I, but awhile ago, (you cruel powers!) \n
In spite of fortune, cropped contentment's sweetest flowers, \n
And yet unscornèd, serve a gentle nymph, the fairest she, \n
That ever was beloved of man, or eyes did ever see! \n
Yea, one whose tender heart would rue for my distress; \n
Yet I, poor I! must perish ne'ertheless. \n
And (which much more augments my care) \n
Unmoanèd I must die, \n
And no man e'er \n
Know why. \n
Thy leave, \n
My dying song, \n
Yet take, ere grief bereave \n
The breath which I enjoy too long, \n
Tell thou that fair one this: my soul prefers \n
Her love above my life; and that I died her's: \n
And let him be, for evermore, to her remembrance dear, \n
Who loved the very thought of her whilst he remained here. \n
And now farewell! thou place of my unhappy birth, \n
Where once I breathed the sweetest air on earth; \n
Since me my wonted joys forsake, \n
And all my trust deceive; \n
Of all I take \n
My leave. \n
Farewell! \n
Sweet groves, to you! \n
You hills, that highest dwell; \n
And all you humble vales, adieu! \n
You wanton brooks, and solitary rocks, \n
My dear companions all! and you, my tender flocks! \n
Farewell my pipe, and all those pleasing songs, whose moving strains \n
Delighted once the fairest nymphs that dance upon the plains! \n
You discontents, whose deep and over-deadly smart \n
Have, without pity, broke the truest heart. \n
Sighs, tears, and every sad annoy, \n
That erst did with me dwell, \n
And all other joys, \n
Farewell! \n
Adieu! \n
Fair shepherdesses! \n
Let garlands of sad yew \n
Adorn your dainty golden tresses. \n
I, that loved you, and often with my quill, \n
Made music that delighted fountain, grove, and hill; \n
I, whom you loved so, and with a sweet and chaste embrace. \n
Yea, with a thousand rather favours, would vouchsafe to grace, \n
I now must leave you all alone, of love to plain; \n
And never pipe, nor never sing again! \n
I must, for evermore, be gone; \n
And therefore bid I you, \n
And every one, \n
Adieu! \n
I die! \n
For, oh! I feel \n
Death's horrors drawing nigh, \n
And all this frame of nature reel. \n
My hopeless heart, despairing of relief, \n
Sinks underneath the heavy weight of saddest grief; \n
Which hath so ruthless torn, so racked, so tortured every vein, \n
All comfort comes too late to have it ever cured again. \n
My swimming head begins to dance death's giddy round; \n
A shuddering chillness doth each sense confound; \n
Benumbed is my cold sweating brow \n
A dimness shuts my eye. \n
And now, oh! now, \n
I die! \n<|endoftext|>

November and December \n
Keep watch within my heart. \n
The spring breathes in the breezes, \n
The woods with wood-notes ring, \n

Are fragrant of the spring. \n
In secret, silent places \n
The live green things upstart; \n
Ice-bound, ice-crown'd dwells winter \n
For ever in my heart. \n
Upon the bridge I linger, \n
Near where the lime-trees grow; \n
Above, swart birds are circling, \n
Beneath, the stream runs slow. \n
A stripling and a maiden \n
Come wand'ring up the way; \n
His eyes are glad with springtime, \n

From summer dying. \n
Why did you die when the lambs were cropping? \n
You should have died at the apples' dropping, \n

Oh! this is a joyful dirge, my friends, and this is a hymn of praise; \n
And this is a clamour of Victory, and a pæan of Ancient Days. \n
It isn’t a Yelp of the Battlefield; nor a Howl of the Bounding Wave, \n
But an ode to the Things that the War has Killed, and a lay of the Festive Grave. \n
’Tis a triolet of the Tomb, you bet, and a whoop because of Despair, \n
And it’s sung as I stand on my hoary head and wave my legs in the air! \n
Oh! I dance on the grave of the Suffragette (I dance on my hands and dome), \n
And the Sanctity-of-the-Marriage-Tie and the Breaking-Up-of-the-Home. \n
And I dance on the grave of the weird White-Slave that died when the war began; \n
And Better-Protection-for-Women-and-Girls, and Men-Made-Laws-for-Man! \n
Oh, I dance on the Liberal Lady’s grave and the Labour Woman’s, too; \n
And the grave of the Female lie and shriek, with a dance that is wild and new. \n
And my only regret in this song-a-let as I dance over dale and hill, \n
Is the Yarn-of-the-Wife and the Tale-of-the-Girl that never a war can kill. \n
Oh, I dance on the grave of the want-ter-write, and I dance on the Tomb of the Sneer, \n
And poet-and-author-and-critic, too, who used to be great round here. \n
But “Old Mother Often” (“Mother of Ten”) and “Parent” escaped from the grave— \n
And “Pro Bono Publico” liveth again, as “Victis,” or “Honour the Brave.” \n
Oh, lightly I danced upon Politics’ grave where the Friend of the Candidate slept, \n
And over the Female Political Devil, oh wildly I bounded and leapt. \n
But this dance shall be nothing compared with the dance of the spook of the writer who sings \n
On the grave of the bard and the Bulletin’s grave, out there at the Finish of Things! \n<|endoftext|>

I am not resigned to the shutting away of loving hearts in the hard ground. \n
So it is, and so it will be, for so it has been, time out of mind: \n
Into the darkness they go, the wise and the lovely. Crowned \n
With lilies and with laurel they go; but I am not resigned. \n
Lovers and thinkers, into the earth with you. \n
Be one with the dull, the indiscriminate dust. \n
A fragment of what you felt, of what you knew, \n
A formula, a phrase remains,—but the best is lost. \n
The answers quick and keen, the honest look, the laughter, the \n
love,— \n
They are gone. They are gone to feed the roses. Elegant and curled \n
Is the blossom. Fragrant is the blossom. I know. But I do not \n
approve. \n
More precious was the light in your eyes than all the roses in the \n
world. \n
Down, down, down into the darkness of the grave \n
Gently they go, the beautiful, the tender, the kind; \n
Quietly they go, the intelligent, the witty, the brave. \n

Like some dull sprite, \n
In dead of night, \n
Bewailing o'er her tomb. \n
Swiftly fly and welcome; \n
It is the fate of fools to rove; \n
With whom I know \n
Wedlock is woe \n
Without the stream of love. \n
Where constant love is wanting, \n
Pleasure has not long to dwell; \n
I view my fate, \n
Alas, too late! \n
So partner, fare thee well. \n
But, my love, remember, \n
Hence we meet and face to face, \n
Thy heart shall ache, \n
Thy soul shall quake, \n
The wretch of all disgrace. \n<|endoftext|>

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear. \n
Calm comes from burning. \n
Tall comes from fast. \n
Comely doesn't come from come. \n
Person comes from mask. \n
The kin of charity is whore, \n
the root of charity is dear. \n
Incentive has its source in song \n
and winning in the sufferer. \n
Afford yourself what you can carry out. \n
A coward and a coda share a word. \n
We get our ugliness from fear. \n
We get our danger from the lord. \n<|endoftext|>

Flowers and birds are in nature \n
With some significant features, \n
To make it fruitful and cute \n
For long they have to do hard, \n
For livings of many other creatures \n
Flowers and birds are in nature \n
So, I cannot find other way but \n
To go to them for a lots of needs; \n
Flowers' dance and birds' song are \n
To cause motion in earth's creatures \n
Flowers and birds are in nature \n

And birds are for ecological fit, therefore \n

In the Red Sea, you were my lonely king of salt, \n
You were my beautiful statue made of basalt. \n

You were my statue representing the king of sand. \n
Your body was looking as it was tattooed with smalt. \n
In the Red Sea, you were my lonely king of salt. \n
At the water high waves' mobile horizon \n
I was a mermaid, caught in your love's prison. \n
I swam to the surface, sometimes, to see you. \n
You were on your ship, at the dawn's purplish blue. \n

Wilt thou forgive that sin where I begun, \n
Which was my sin, though it were done before? \n
Wilt thou forgive that sin, through which I run, \n
And do run still, though still I do deplore? \n
When thou hast done, thou hast not done, \n
For I have more. \n
Wilt thou forgive that sin which I have won \n
Others to sin, and made my sin their door? \n
Wilt thou forgive that sin which I did shun \n
A year or two, but wallow'd in, a score? \n
When thou hast done, thou hast not done, \n
For I have more. \n
I have a sin of fear, that when I have spun \n
My last thread, I shall perish on the shore; \n
But swear by thyself, that at my death thy Son \n
Shall shine as he shines now, and heretofore; \n
And, having done that, thou hast done; \n
I fear no more. \n<|endoftext|>
hymn \n
There on the shelf lies the leather bound hymn book, \n
Once taken to chapel on each Sunday morn, \n
For so many years it had served a great purpose \n
But now it lies faded, so battered and worn. \n
The pages been turned many times many searches, \n
For dog-eared and creased by those kind Christian hands, \n
Whose voices sang out in the praise of our Saviour, \n
And rang through the hills of these once sacred lands. \n
Yet now almost silent as churches lie empty, \n
Demolished, converted or left boarded up, \n
And hiding the stained-glass that once let in sunlight, \n
Who now to taste the sweet wine from the cup? \n
When this hymn book was new I know things were so different, \n
I wish we'd return to those times long before, \n
As cast now aside on that dusty old bookcase, \n
Once valued and cherished but not anymore. \n
I look at the words written down through the ages, \n
They still carry meaning from which we should learn, \n
And each seems to stir a deep passion within me, \n
I long for the day that my Lord shall return. \n<|endoftext|>

Old leaves have no defence against the wind. \n

The bells of Salem church play elegies. \n
Distance becomes a single snowflake's fall. \n
The mood is blue as autumn's last frost flowers, \n
Small bits of heaven hidden in the grass. \n
Tom Roach who called them by their favored name, \n
Went home across the green fields long ago. \n
Yet sometimes when the light moves slowly west, \n
And bells summon a faithful few for prayers, \n
I see his shadow picking a bouquet. \n
To live in memory is to be alive. \n
For my grandfather who started to work in the coal mines of West Virginia when he was twelve years old. \n<|endoftext|>

hymn \n
It was the winter wild, \n
While the heaven-born Child \n
All meanly wrapt in the rude manger lies; \n
Nature in awe to Him \n
Had doffed her gaudy trim, \n
With her great Master so to sympathize: \n
It was no season then for her \n
To wanton with the sun, her lusty paramour. \n
Only with speeches fair \n
She woos the gentle air \n
To hide her guilty front with innocent snow, \n
And on her naked shame, \n
Pollute with sinful blame, \n
The saintly veil of maiden white to throw, \n
Confounded that her Maker's eyes \n
Should look so near upon her foul deformities. \n
But He, her fears to cease, \n
Sent down the meek-eyed Peace; \n
She, crowned with olive green, came softly sliding \n
Down through the turning sphere, \n
His ready harbinger, \n
With turtle wing the amorous clouds dividing; \n
And waving wide her myrtle wand, \n
She strikes a universal peace through sea and land. \n
Nor war, or battle's sound \n
Was heard the world around: \n
The idle spear and shield were high uphung, \n
The hooked chariot stood \n
Unstained with hostile blood, \n
The trumpet spake not to the armed throng; \n
And kings sat still with awful eye, \n
As if they surely knew their sov'reign Lord was by. \n
But peaceful was the night, \n
Wherein the Prince of Light \n
His reign of peace upon the earth began: \n
The winds with wonder whist \n
Smoothly the waters kist, \n
Whisp'ring new joys to the mild ocean, \n
Who now hath quite forgot to rave, \n
While birds of calm sit brooding on the charmed wave. \n
The stars with deep amaze \n
Stand fixed in steadfast gaze, \n
Bending one way their precious influence, \n
And will not take their flight, \n
For all the morning light, \n
Or Lucifer that often warned them thence; \n
But in their glimmering orbs did glow, \n
Until their Lord Himself bespake, and bid them go. \n
And though the shady gloom \n
Had given day her room, \n
The sun himself withheld his wonted speed, \n
And hid his head for shame, \n
As his inferior flame \n
The new-enlightened world no more should need; \n
He saw a greater sun appear \n
Than his bright throne, or burning axletree could bear. \n
The shepherds on the lawn, \n
Or ere the point of dawn, \n
Sat simply chatting in a rustic row; \n
Full little thought they then \n
That the mighty Pan \n
Was kindly come to live with them below; \n
Perhaps their loves, or else their sheep, \n
Was all that did their silly thoughts so busy keep. \n
When such music sweet \n
Their hearts and ears did greet, \n
As never was by mortal finger strook, \n
Divinely-warbled voice \n
Answering the stringed noise, \n
As all their souls in blissful rapture took: \n
The air such pleasure loth to lose, \n
With thousand echoes still prolongs each heavenly close. \n
Nature that heard such sound, \n
Beneath the hollow round \n
Of Cynthia's seat, the airy region thrilling, \n
Now was almost won \n
To think her part was done, \n
And that her reign had here its last fulfilling; \n
She knew such harmony alone \n
Could hold all heav'n and earth in happier union. \n
At last surrounds their sight \n
A globe of circular light, \n
That with long beams the shamefaced night arrayed; \n
The helmed Cherubim, \n
And sworded Seraphim, \n
Are seen in glittering ranks with wings displayed, \n
Harping in loud and solemn quire, \n
With unexpressive notes to Heaven's new-born Heir. \n
Such music (as 'tis said) \n
Before was never made, \n
But when of old the sons of morning sung, \n
While the Creator great \n
His constellations set, \n
And the well-balanced world on hinges hung, \n
And cast the dark foundations deep, \n
And bid the welt'ring waves their oozy channel keep. \n
Ring out, ye crystal spheres, \n
Once bless our human ears, \n
If ye have power to touch our senses so; \n
And let your silver chime \n
Move in melodious time, \n
And let the base of heav'n's deep organ blow; \n
And with your ninefold harmony \n
Make up full consort to th' angelic symphony. \n
For if such holy song \n
Enwrap our fancy long, \n
Time will run back, and fetch the age of gold, \n
And speckled Vanity \n
Will sicken soon and die, \n
And leprous Sin will melt from earthly mould; \n
And Hell itself will pass away, \n
And leave her dolorous mansions to the peering day. \n
Yea Truth and Justice then \n
Will down return to men, \n
Orbed in a rainbow; and, like glories wearing, \n
Mercy will sit between, \n
Throned in celestial sheen, \n
With radiant feet the tissued clouds down steering; \n
And Heav'n, as at some festival, \n
Will open wide the gates of her high palace hall. \n
But wisest Fate says No, \n
This must not yet be so, \n
The Babe yet lies in smiling infancy \n
That on the bitter cross \n
Must redeem our loss; \n
So both Himself and us to glorify; \n
Yet first, to those ychained in sleep \n
The wakeful trump of doom must thunder through the deep; \n
With such a horrid clang \n
As on mount Sinai rang, \n
While the red fire and smouldering clouds outbrake: \n
The aged Earth aghast, \n
With terror of that blast, \n
Shall from the surface to the centre shake; \n
When at the world's last session, \n
The dreadful Judge in middle air shall spread His throne. \n
And then at last our bliss \n
Full and perfect is, \n
But now begins; for from this happy day \n
The old Dragon under ground, \n
In straiter limits bound, \n
Not half so far casts his usurped sway; \n
And wroth to see his kingdom fail, \n
Swinges the scaly horror of his folded tail. \n
The oracles are dumb, \n
No voice or hideous hum \n
Runs through the arched roof in words deceiving. \n
Apollo from his shrine \n
Can no more divine, \n
With hollow shriek the steep of Delphos leaving. \n
No nightly trance or breathed spell \n
Inspires the pale-eyed priest from the prophetic cell. \n
The lonely mountains o'er, \n
And the resounding shore, \n
A voice of weeping heard and loud lament; \n
From haunted spring, and dale \n
Edged with popular pale, \n
The parting genius is with sighing sent; \n
With flow'r-inwoven tresses torn \n
The Nymphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn. \n
In consecrated earth, \n
And on the holy hearth, \n
The Lars and Lemures moan with midnight plaint; \n
In urns and altars round, \n
A drear and dying sound \n
Affrights the Flamens at their service quaint; \n
And the chill marble seems to sweat, \n
While each peculiar Pow'r forgoes his wonted seat. \n
Peor and Baalim \n
Forsake their temples dim, \n
With that twice-battered God of Palestine; \n
And mooned Ashtaroth, \n
Heav'n's queen and mother both, \n
Now sits not girt with tapers' holy shine; \n
The Lybic Hammon shrinks his horn, \n
In vain the Tyrian maids their wounded Thammuz mourn. \n
And sullen Moloch fled, \n
Hath left in shadows dread \n
His burning idol all of blackest hue; \n
In vain with cymbals' ring \n
They call the grisly king, \n
In dismal dance about the furnace blue; \n
The brutish gods of Nile as fast, \n
Isis and Orus, and the dog Anubis haste. \n
Nor is Osiris seen \n
In Memphian grove or green, \n
Trampling the unshowered grass with lowings loud: \n
Nor can he be at rest \n
Within his sacred chest, \n
Nought but profoundest hell can be his shroud; \n
In vain with timbrelled anthems dark \n
The sable stoled sorcerers bear his worshipped ark. \n
He feels from Juda's land \n
The dreaded Infant's hand, \n
The rays of Bethlehem blind his dusky eyn; \n
Nor all the gods beside \n
Longer dare abide, \n
Nor Typhon huge ending in snaky twine: \n
Our Babe, to show his Godhead true, \n
Can in His swaddling bands control the damned crew. \n
So when the sun in bed, \n
Curtained with cloudy red, \n
Pillows his chin upon an orient wave, \n
The flocking shadows pale \n
Troop to th' infernal jail, \n
Each fettered ghost slips to his several grave; \n
And the yellow-skirted Fayes \n
Fly after the night-steeds, leaving their moon-loved maze. \n
But see, the Virgin blest \n
Hath laid her Babe to rest, \n
Time is our tedious song should here have ending: \n
Heav'n's youngest-teemed star \n
Hath fixed her polished car, \n
Her sleeping Lord with handmaid lamp attending; \n
And all about the courtly stable \n
Bright-harnessed Angels sit in order serviceable. \n<|endoftext|>

hymn \n
Eternal power of earth and air, \n
Unseen, yet seen in all around, \n
Remote, but dwelling everywhere, \n
Though silent, heard in every sound. \n
If e'er thine ear in mercy bent \n
When wretched mortals cried to thee, \n
And if indeed thy Son was sent \n
To save lost sinners such as me. \n
Then hear me now, while kneeling here; \n
I lift to thee my heart and eye \n
And all my soul ascends in prayer; \n
O give me -­ give me Faith I cry. \n
Without some glimmering in my heart, \n
I could not raise this fervent prayer; \n
But O a stronger light impart, \n
And in thy mercy fix it there! \n
While Faith is with me I am blest; \n
It turns my darkest night to day; \n
But while I clasp it to my breast \n
I often feel it slide away. \n
Then cold and dark my spirit sinks, \n
To see my light of life depart, \n
And every fiend of Hell methinks \n
Enjoys the anguish of my heart. \n
What shall I do if all my love, \n
My hopes, my toil, are cast away, \n
And if there be no God above \n
To hear and bless me when I pray? \n
If this be vain delusion all, \n
If death be an eternal sleep, \n
And none can hear my secret call, \n
Or see the silent tears I weep. \n
O help me God! for thou alone \n
Canst my distracted soul relieve; \n
Forsake it not -- it is thine own, \n
Though weak yet longing to believe. \n
O drive these cruel doubts away \n
And make me know that thou art God; \n
A Faith that shines by night and day \n
Will lighten every earthly load. \n
If I believe that Jesus died \n
And waking rose to reign above, \n
Then surely Sorrow, Sin and Pride \n
Must yield to peace and hope and love. \n
And all the blessed words he said \n
Will strength and holy joy impart, \n
A shield of safety o'er my head, \n
A spring of comfort in my heart. \n<|endoftext|>

How happy are our ears \n
That hear this joyful sound, \n
Which kings and prophets waited for, \n
And sought, but never found! \n
How blessed are our eyes \n
That see this heav'nly light \n
Prophets and kings desired it long, \n
But died without the sight. \n
The watchmen join their voice, \n
And tuneful notes employ; \n
Jerusalem breaks forth in songs, \n
And deserts learn the joy. \n
The Lord makes bare his arm \n
Through all the earth abroad; \n
Let every nation now behold \n
Their Savior and their God! \n<|endoftext|>
hymn \n
IT was the Winter wilde, \n
While the Heav'n-born-childe, \n
All meanly wrapt in the rude manger lies; \n
Nature in aw to him \n
Had doff't her gawdy trim, \n
With her great Master so to sympathize: \n
It was no season then for her \n
To wanton with the Sun her lusty Paramour. \n
Only with speeches fair \n
She woo's the gentle Air \n
To hide her guilty front with innocent Snow, \n
And on her naked shame, \n
Pollute with sinfull blame, \n
The Saintly Vail of Maiden white to throw, \n
Confounded, that her Makers eyes \n
Should look so neer upon her foul deformities. \n
But he her fears to cease, \n
Sent down the meek-eyd Peace, \n
She crown'd with Olive green, came softly sliding \n
Down through the turning sphear \n
His ready Harbinger, \n
With Turtle wing the amorous clouds dividing, \n
And waving wide her mirtle wand, \n
She strikes a universall Peace through Sea and Land. \n
No War, or Battails sound \n
Was heard the World around, \n
The idle spear and shield were high up hung; \n
The hooked Chariot stood \n
Unstain'd with hostile blood, \n
The Trumpet spake not to the armed throng, \n
And Kings sate still with awfull eye, \n
As if they surely knew their sovran Lord was by. \n
But peacefull was the night \n
Wherin the Prince of light \n
His raign of peace upon the earth began: \n
The Windes with wonder whist, \n
Smoothly the waters kist, \n
Whispering new joyes to the milde Ocean, \n
Who now hath quite forgot to rave, \n
While Birds of Calm sit brooding on the charmeed wave. \n
The Stars with deep amaze \n
Stand fixt in stedfast gaze, \n
Bending one way their pretious influence, \n
And will not take their flight, \n
For all the morning light, \n
Or Lucifer that often warn'd them thence; \n
But in their glimmering Orbs did glow, \n
Untill their Lord himself bespake, and bid them go. \n
And though the shady gloom \n
Had given day her room, \n
The Sun himself with-held his wonted speed, \n
And hid his head for shame, \n
As his inferiour flame, \n
The new enlightn'd world no more should need; \n
He saw a greater Sun appear \n
Then his bright Throne, or burning Axletree could bear. \n
The Shepherds on the Lawn, \n
Or ere the point of dawn, \n
Sate simply chatting in a rustick row; \n
Full little thought they than, \n
That the mighty Pan \n
Was kindly com to live with them below; \n
Perhaps their loves, or els their sheep, \n
Was all that did their silly thoughts so busie keep. \n
When such musick sweet \n
Their hearts and ears did greet, \n
As never was by mortall finger strook, \n
Divinely-warbled voice \n
Answering the stringed noise, \n
As all their souls in blisfull rapture took \n
The Air such pleasure loth to lose, \n
With thousand echo's still prolongs each heav'nly close. \n
Nature that heard such sound \n
Beneath the hollow round \n
Of Cynthia's seat, the Airy region thrilling, \n
Now was almost won \n
To think her part was don, \n
And that her raign had here its last fulfilling; \n
She knew such harmony alone \n
Could hold all Heav'n and Earth in happier union. \n
At last surrounds their sight \n
A Globe of circular light, \n
That with long beams the shame-fac't night array'd, \n
The helmed Cherubim \n
And sworded Seraphim, \n
Are seen in glittering ranks with wings displaid, \n
Harping in loud and solemn quire, \n
With unexpressive notes to Heav'ns new-born Heir. \n
Such musick (as 'tis said) \n
Before was never made, \n
But when of old the sons of morning sung, \n
While the Creator Great \n
His constellations set, \n
And the well-ballanc't world on hinges hung, \n
And cast the dark foundations deep, \n
And bid the weltring waves their oozy channel keep. \n
Ring out ye Crystall sphears, \n
Once bless our human ears, \n
(If ye have power to touch our senses so) \n
And let your silver chime \n
Move in melodious time; \n
And let the Base of Heav'ns deep Organ blow \n
And with your ninefold harmony \n
Make up full consort to th'Angelike symphony. \n
For if such holy Song \n
Enwrap our fancy long, \n
Time will run back, and fetch the age of gold, \n
And speckl'd vanity \n
Will sicken soon and die, \n
And leprous sin will melt from earthly mould, \n
And Hell it self will pass away, \n
And leave her dolorous mansions to the peering day. \n
Yea Truth, and Justice then \n
Will down return to men, \n
Th'enameld Arras of the Rain-bow wearing, \n
And Mercy set between, \n
Thron'd in Celestiall sheen, \n
With radiant feet the tissued clouds down stearing, \n
And Heav'n as at som festivall, \n
Will open wide the Gates of her high Palace Hall. \n
But wisest Fate sayes no, \n
This must not yet be so, \n
The Babe lies yet in smiling Infancy, \n
That on the bitter cross \n
Must redeem our loss; \n
So both himself and us to glorifie: \n
Yet first to those ychain'd in sleep, \n
The wakefull trump of doom must thunder through the deep, \n
With such a horrid clang \n
As on mount Sinai rang \n
While the red fire, and smouldring clouds out brake: \n
The aged Earth agast \n
With terrour of that blast, \n
Shall from the surface to the center shake; \n
When at the worlds last session, \n
The dreadfull Judge in middle Air shall spread his throne. \n
And then at last our bliss \n
Full and perfect is, \n
But now begins; for from this happy day \n
Th'old Dragon under ground \n
In straiter limits bound, \n
Not half so far casts his usurped sway, \n
And wrath to see his Kingdom fail, \n
Swindges the scaly Horrour of his foulded tail. \n
The Oracles are dumm, \n
No voice or hideous humm \n
Runs through the arched roof in words deceiving. \n
Apollo from his shrine \n
Can no more divine, \n
With hollow shreik the steep of Delphos leaving. \n
No nightly trance, or breathed spell, \n
Inspire's the pale-ey'd Priest from the prophetic cell. \n
The lonely mountains o're, \n
And the resounding shore, \n
A voice of weeping heard, and loud lament; \n
From haunted spring, and dale \n
Edg'd with poplar pale, \n
The parting Genius is with sighing sent, \n
With flowre-inwov'n tresses torn \n
The Nimphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn. \n
In consecrated Earth, \n
And on the holy Hearth, \n
The Lars, and Lemures moan with midnight plaint, \n
In Urns, and Altars round, \n
A drear, and dying sound \n
Affrights the Flamins at their service quaint; \n
And the chill Marble seems to sweat, \n
While each peculiar power forgoes his wonted seat \n
Peor, and Baalim, \n
Forsake their Temples dim, \n
With that twise-batter'd god of Palestine, \n
And mooned Ashtaroth, \n
Heav'ns Queen and Mother both, \n
Now sits not girt with Tapers holy shine, \n
The Libyc Hammon shrinks his horn, \n
In vain the Tyrian Maids their wounded Thamuz mourn. \n
And sullen Moloch fled, \n
Hath left in shadows dred, \n
His burning Idol all of blackest hue, \n
In vain with Cymbals ring, \n
They call the grisly king, \n
In dismall dance about the furnace blue; \n
The brutish gods of Nile as fast, \n
Isis and Orus, and the Dog Anubis hast. \n
Nor is Osiris seen \n
In Memphian Grove, or Green, \n
Trampling the unshowr'd Grasse with lowings loud: \n
Nor can he be at rest \n
Within his sacred chest, \n
Naught but profoundest Hell can be his shroud, \n
In vain with Timbrel'd Anthems dark \n
The sable-stoled Sorcerers bear his worshipt Ark. \n
He feels from Juda's Land \n
The dredded Infants hand, \n
The rayes of Bethlehem blind his dusky eyn; \n
Nor all the gods beside, \n
Longer dare abide, \n
Not Typhon huge ending in snaky twine: \n
Our Babe to shew his Godhead true, \n
Can in his swadling bands controul the damned crew. \n
So when the Sun in bed, \n
Curtain'd with cloudy red, \n
Pillows his chin upon an Orient wave, \n
The flocking shadows pale, \n
Troop to th'infernall jail, \n
Each fetter'd Ghost slips to his severall grave, \n
And the yellow-skirted Fayes, \n
Fly after the Night-steeds, leaving their Moon-lov'd maze. \n
But see the Virgin blest, \n
Hath laid her Babe to rest. \n
Time is our tedious Song should here have ending, \n
Heav'ns youngest teemed Star, \n
Hath fixt her polisht Car, \n
Her sleeping Lord with Handmaid Lamp attending: \n
And all about the Courtly Stable, \n
Bright-harnest Angels sit in order serviceable. \n<|endoftext|>
hymn \n
By the rude bridge that arched the flood, \n
Their flag to April's breeze unfurled, \n
Here once the embattled farmers stood \n
And fired the shot heard round the world. \n
The foe long since in silence slept; \n
Alike the conqueror silent sleeps; \n
And Time the ruined bridge has swept \n
Down the dark stream which seaward creeps. \n
On this green bank, by this soft stream, \n
We set today a votive stone; \n
That memory may their deed redeem, \n
When, like our sires, our sons are gone. \n
Spirit, that made those heroes dare \n
To die, and leave their children free, \n
Bid Time and Nature gently spare \n
The shaft we raise to them and thee. \n<|endoftext|>
hymn \n
Abraham's blessing on the Gentiles. \n
Gen. 17:7; Rom. 15:8; Mk 10:14. \n
How large the promise, how divine, \n
To Abram and his seed! \n
"I'll be a God to thee and thine, \n
Supplying all their need." \n
The words of his extensive love \n
From age to age endure; \n
The Angel of the cov'nant proves, \n
And seals the blessing sure. \n
Jesus the ancient faith confirms, \n
To our great fathers giv'n; \n
He takes young children to his arms, \n
And calls them heirs of heav'n. \n
Our God, how faithful are his ways! \n
His love endures the same; \n
Nor from the promise of his grace \n
Blots out the children's name. \n<|endoftext|>
hymn \n
FROM the forests and highlands \n
We come, we come; \n
From the river-girt islands, \n
Where loud waves are dumb \n
Listening to my sweet pipings. \n
The wind in the reeds and the rushes, \n
The bees on the bells of thyme, \n
The birds on the myrtle-bushes, \n
The cicale above in the lime, \n
And the lizards below in the grass, \n
Were as silent as ever old Tmolus was, \n
Listening to my sweet pipings. \n
Liquid Peneus was flowing, \n
And all dark Temple lay \n
In Pelion's shadow, outgrowing \n
The light of the dying day, \n
Speeded by my sweet pipings. \n
The Sileni and Sylvans and fauns, \n
And the Nymphs of the woods and wave \n
To the edge of the moist river-lawns, \n
And the brink of the dewy caves, \n
And all that did then attend and follow, \n
Were silent with love,--as you now, Apollo, \n
With envy of my sweet pipings. \n
I sang of the dancing stars, \n
I sang of the dedal earth, \n
And of heaven, and the Giant wars, \n
And love, and death, and birth. \n
And then I changed my pipings,-- \n
Singing how down the vale of Maenalus \n
I pursued a maiden, and clasped a reed: \n
Gods and men, we are all deluded thus; \n
It breaks in our bosom, and then we bleed. \n
All wept--as I think both ye now would, \n
If envy or age had not frozen your blood-- \n
At the sorrow of my sweet pipings. \n<|endoftext|>
hymn \n
Rapt with the rage of mine own ravish'd thought, \n
Through contemplation of those goodly sights, \n
And glorious images in heaven wrought, \n
Whose wondrous beauty, breathing sweet delights \n
Do kindle love in high-conceited sprights; \n
I fain to tell the things that I behold, \n
But feel my wits to fail, and tongue to fold. \n
Vouchsafe then, O thou most Almighty Spright, \n
From whom all gifts of wit and knowledge flow, \n
To shed into my breast some sparkling light \n
Of thine eternal truth, that I may show \n
Some little beams to mortal eyes below \n
Of that immortal beauty, there with thee, \n
Which in my weak distraughted mind I see; \n
That with the glory of so goodly sight \n
The hearts of men, which fondly here admire \n
Fair seeming shews, and feed on vain delight, \n
Transported with celestial desire \n
Of those fair forms, may lift themselves up higher, \n
And learn to love, with zealous humble duty, \n
Th' eternal fountain of that heavenly beauty. \n
Beginning then below, with th' easy view \n
Of this base world, subject to fleshly eye, \n
From thence to mount aloft, by order due, \n
To contemplation of th' immortal sky; \n
Of the soare falcon so I learn to fly, \n
That flags awhile her fluttering wings beneath, \n
Till she herself for stronger flight can breathe. \n
Then look, who list thy gazeful eyes to feed \n
With sight of that is fair, look on the frame \n
Of this wide universe, and therein reed \n
The endless kinds of creatures which by name \n
Thou canst not count, much less their natures aim; \n
All which are made with wondrous wise respect, \n
And all with admirable beauty deckt. \n
First th' earth, on adamantine pillars founded, \n
Amid the sea engirt with brazen bands; \n
Then th' air still flitting, but yet firmly bounded \n
On every side, with piles of flaming brands, \n
Never consum'd, nor quench'd with mortal hands; \n
And last, that mighty shining crystal wall, \n
Wherewith he hath encompassed this All. \n
By view whereof it plainly may appear, \n
That still as every thing doth upward tend, \n
And further is from earth, so still more clear \n
And fair it grows, till to his perfect end \n
Of purest beauty it at last ascend; \n
Air more than water, fire much more than air, \n
And heaven than fire, appears more pure and fair. \n
Look thou no further, but affix thine eye \n
On that bright, shiny, round, still moving mass, \n
The house of blessed gods, which men call sky, \n
All sow'd with glist'ring stars more thick than grass, \n
Whereof each other doth in brightness pass, \n
But those two most, which ruling night and day, \n
As king and queen, the heavens' empire sway; \n
And tell me then, what hast thou ever seen \n
That to their beauty may compared be, \n
Or can the sight that is most sharp and keen \n
Endure their captain's flaming head to see? \n
How much less those, much higher in degree, \n
And so much fairer, and much more than these, \n
As these are fairer than the land and seas? \n
For far above these heavens, which here we see, \n
Be others far exceeding these in light, \n
Not bounded, not corrupt, as these same be, \n
But infinite in largeness and in height, \n
Unmoving, uncorrupt, and spotless bright, \n
That need no sun t' illuminate their spheres, \n
But their own native light far passing theirs. \n
And as these heavens still by degrees arise, \n
Until they come to their first Mover's bound, \n
That in his mighty compass doth comprise, \n
And carry all the rest with him around; \n
So those likewise do by degrees redound, \n
And rise more fair; till they at last arrive \n
To the most fair, whereto they all do strive. \n
Fair is the heaven where happy souls have place, \n
In full enjoyment of felicity, \n
Whence they do still behold the glorious face \n
Of the divine eternal Majesty; \n
More fair is that, where those Ideas on high \n
Enranged be, which Plato so admired, \n
And pure Intelligences from God inspired. \n
Yet fairer is that heaven, in which do reign \n
The sovereign Powers and mighty Potentates, \n
Which in their high protections do contain \n
All mortal princes and imperial states; \n
And fairer yet, whereas the royal Seats \n
And heavenly Dominations are set, \n
From whom all earthly governance is fet. \n
Yet far more fair be those bright Cherubins, \n
Which all with golden wings are overdight, \n
And those eternal burning Seraphins, \n
Which from their faces dart out fiery light; \n
Yet fairer than they both, and much more bright, \n
Be th' Angels and Archangels, which attend \n
On God's own person, without rest or end. \n
These thus in fair each other far excelling, \n
As to the highest they approach more near, \n
Yet is that highest far beyond all telling, \n
Fairer than all the rest which there appear, \n
Though all their beauties join'd together were; \n
How then can mortal tongue hope to express \n
The image of such endless perfectness? \n
Cease then, my tongue, and lend unto my mind \n
Leave to bethink how great that beauty is, \n
Whose utmost parts so beautiful I find; \n
How much more those essential parts of his, \n
His truth, his love, his wisdom, and his bliss, \n
His grace, his doom, his mercy, and his might, \n
By which he lends us of himself a sight. \n
Those unto all he daily doth display, \n
And shew himself in th' image of his grace, \n
As in a looking-glass, through which he may \n
Be seen of all his creatures vile and base, \n
That are unable else to see his face, \n
His glorious face which glistereth else so bright, \n
That th' Angels selves cannot endure his sight. \n
But we, frail wights, whose sight cannot sustain \n
The sun's bright beams when he on us doth shine, \n
But that their points rebutted back again \n
Are dull'd, how can we see with feeble eyne \n
The glory of that Majesty Divine, \n
In sight of whom both sun and moon are dark, \n
Compared to his least resplendent spark? \n
The means, therefore, which unto us is lent \n
Him to behold, is on his works to look, \n
Which he hath made in beauty excellent, \n
And in the same, as in a brazen book, \n
To read enregister'd in every nook \n
His goodness, which his beauty doth declare; \n
For all that's good is beautiful and fair. \n
Thence gathering plumes of perfect speculation, \n
To imp the wings of thy high-flying mind, \n
Mount up aloft through heavenly contemplation, \n
From this dark world, whose damps the soul so blind, \n
And, like the native brood of eagles' kind, \n
On that bright Sun of Glory fix thine eyes, \n
Clear'd from gross mists of frail infirmities. \n
Humbled with fear and awful reverence, \n
Before the footstool of his majesty \n
Throw thyself down, with trembling innocence, \n
Ne dare look up with corruptible eye \n
On the dread face of that great Deity, \n
For fear, lest if he chance to look on thee, \n
Thou turn to nought, and quite confounded be. \n
But lowly fall before his mercy seat, \n
Close covered with the Lamb's integrity \n
From the just wrath of his avengeful threat \n
That sits upon the righteous throne on high; \n
His throne is built upon eternity, \n
More firm and durable than steel or brass, \n
Or the hard diamond, which them both doth pass. \n
His sceptre is the rod of righteousness, \n
With which he bruiseth all his foes to dust, \n
And the great Dragon strongly doth repress, \n
Under the rigour of his judgement just; \n
His seat is truth, to which the faithful trust, \n
From whence proceed her beams so pure and bright \n
That all about him sheddeth glorious light: \n
Light far exceeding that bright blazing spark \n
Which darted is from Titan's flaming head, \n
That with his beams enlumineth the dark \n
And dampish air, whereby all things are read; \n
Whose nature yet so much is marvelled \n
Of mortal wits, that it doth much amaze \n
The greatest wizards which thereon do gaze. \n
But that immortal light, which there doth shine, \n
Is many thousand times more bright, more clear, \n
More excellent, more glorious, more divine, \n
Through which to God all mortal actions here, \n
And even the thoughts of men, do plain appear; \n
For from th' eternal truth it doth proceed, \n
Through heavenly virtue which her beams do breed. \n
With the great glory of that wondrous light \n
His throne is all encompassed around, \n
And hid in his own brightness from the sight \n
Of all that look thereon with eyes unsound; \n
And underneath his feet are to be found \n
Thunder and lightning and tempestuous fire, \n
The instruments of his avenging ire. \n
There in his bosom Sapience doth sit, \n
The sovereign darling of the Deity, \n
Clad like a queen in royal robes, most fit \n
For so great power and peerless majesty, \n
And all with gems and jewels gorgeously \n
Adorn'd, that brighter than the stars appear, \n
And make her native brightness seem more clear. \n
And on her head a crown of purest gold \n
Is set, in sign of highest sovereignty; \n
And in her hand a sceptre she doth hold, \n
With which she rules the house of God on high, \n
And manageth the ever-moving sky, \n
And in the same these lower creatures all \n
Subjected to her power imperial. \n
Both heaven and earth obey unto her will, \n
And all the creatures which they both contain; \n
For of her fullness which the world doth fill \n
They all partake, and do in state remain \n
As their great Maker did at first ordain, \n
Through observation of her high behest, \n
By which they first were made, and still increast. \n
The fairness of her face no tongue can tell; \n
For she the daughters of all women's race, \n
And angels eke, in beauty doth excel, \n
Sparkled on her from God's own glorious face, \n
And more increas'd by her own goodly grace, \n
That it doth far exceed all human thought, \n
Ne can on earth compared be to aught. \n
Ne could that painter (had he lived yet) \n
Which pictured Venus with so curious quill, \n
That all posterity admired it, \n
Have portray'd this, for all his mast'ring skill; \n
Ne she herself, had she remained still, \n
And were as fair as fabling wits do feign, \n
Could once come near this beauty sovereign. \n
But had those wits, the wonders of their days, \n
Or that sweet Teian poet, which did spend \n
His plenteous vein in setting forth her praise, \n
Seen but a glimpse of this which I pretend, \n
How wondrously would he her face commend, \n
Above that idol of his feigning thought, \n
That all the world should with his rhymes be fraught. \n
How then dare I, the novice of his art, \n
Presume to picture so divine a wight, \n
Or hope t' express her least perfection's part, \n
Whose beauty fills the heavens with her light, \n
And darks the earth with shadow of her sight? \n
Ah, gentle Muse, thou art too weak and faint \n
The portrait of so heavenly hue to paint. \n
Let angels, which her goodly face behold \n
And see at will, her sovereign praises sing, \n
And those most sacred mysteries unfold \n
Of that fair love of mighty heaven's King; \n
Enough is me t' admire so heavenly thing, \n
And being thus with her huge love possest, \n
In th' only wonder of herself to rest. \n
But whoso may, thrice happy man him hold, \n
Of all on earth whom God so much doth grace \n
And lets his own beloved to behold; \n
For in the view of her celestial face \n
All joy, all bliss, all happiness, have place; \n
Ne aught on earth can want unto the wight \n
Who of herself can win the wishful sight. \n
For she, out of her secret treasury, \n
Plenty of riches forth on him will pour, \n
Even heavenly riches, which there hidden lie \n
Within the closet of her chastest bower, \n
Th' eternal portion of her precious dower, \n
Which mighty God hath given to her free, \n
And to all those which thereof worthy be. \n
None thereof worthy be, but those whom she \n
Vouchsafeth to her presence to receive, \n
And letteth them her lovely face to see, \n
Whereof such wondrous pleasures they conceive, \n
And sweet contentment, that it doth bereave \n
Their soul of sense, through infinite delight, \n
And them transport from flesh into the spright. \n
In which they see such admirable things, \n
As carries them into an ecstasy, \n
And hear such heavenly notes, and carollings \n
Of God's high praise, that fills the brazen sky; \n
And feel such joy and pleasure inwardly, \n
That maketh them all worldly cares forget, \n
And only think on that before them set. \n
Ne from thenceforth doth any fleshly sense, \n
Or idle thought of earthly things, remain; \n
But all that erst seem'd sweet seems now offence, \n
And all that pleased erst now seems to pain; \n
Their joy, their comfort, their desire, their gain, \n
Is fixed all on that which now they see; \n
All other sights but feigned shadows be. \n
And that fair lamp, which useth to inflame \n
The hearts of men with self-consuming fire \n
Thenceforth seems foul, and full of sinful blame; \n
And all that pomp to which proud minds aspire \n
By name of honour, and so much desire, \n
Seems to them baseness, and all riches dross, \n
And all mirth sadness, and all lucre loss. \n
So full their eyes are of that glorious sight, \n
And senses fraught with such satiety, \n
That in nought else on earth they can delight, \n
But in th' aspect of that felicity, \n
Which they have written in their inward eye; \n
On which they feed, and in their fastened mind \n
All happy joy and full contentment find. \n
Ah, then, my hungry soul, which long hast fed \n
On idle fancies of thy foolish thought, \n
And, with false beauty's flatt'ring bait misled, \n
Hast after vain deceitful shadows sought, \n
Which all are fled, and now have left thee nought \n
But late repentance through thy follies prief; \n
Ah cease to gaze on matter of thy grief: \n
And look at last up to that sovereign light, \n
From whose pure beams all perfect beauty springs, \n
That kindleth love in every godly sprite, \n
Even the love of God, which loathing brings \n
Of this vile world and these gay-seeming things; \n
With whose sweet pleasures being so possest, \n
Thy straying thoughts henceforth for ever rest. \n<|endoftext|>
hymn \n
THE spacious firmament on high, \n
With all the blue ethereal sky, \n
And spangled heavens, a shining frame, \n
Their great Original proclaim. \n
Th' unwearied Sun from day to day \n
Does his Creator's power display; \n
And publishes to every land \n
The work of an Almighty hand. \n
Soon as the evening shades prevail, \n
The Moon takes up the wondrous tale; \n
And nightly to the listening Earth \n
Repeats the story of her birth: \n
Whilst all the stars that round her burn, \n
And all the planets in their turn, \n
Confirm the tidings as they roll, \n
And spread the truth from pole to pole. \n
What though in solemn silence all \n
Move round the dark terrestrial ball; \n
What though nor real voice nor sound \n
Amidst their radiant orbs be found? \n
In Reason's ear they all rejoice, \n
And utter forth a glorious voice; \n
For ever singing as they shine, \n
'The Hand that made us is divine.' \n<|endoftext|>
hymn \n
Dread Mother of Forgetfulness \n
Who, when Thy reign begins, \n
Wipest away the Soul's distress, \n
And memory of her sins. \n
The trusty Worm that dieth not-- \n
The steadfast Fire also, \n
By Thy contrivance are forgot \n
In a completer woe. \n
Thine are the lidless eyes of night \n
That stare upon our tears, \n
Through certain hours which in our sight \n
Exceed a thousand years: \n
Thine is the thickness of the Dark \n
That presses in our pain, \n
As Thine the Dawn that bids us mark \n
Life's grinning face again. \n
Thine is the weariness outworn \n
No promise shall relieve, \n
That says at eve, "Would God 'twere morn" \n
At morn, "Would God 'twere eve!" \n
And when Thy tender mercies cease \n
And life unvexed is due, \n
Instant upon the false release \n
The Worm and Fire renew. \n
Wherefore we praise Thee in the deep, \n
And on our beds we pray \n
For Thy return that Thou may'st keep \n
The Pains of Hell at bay! \n<|endoftext|>
hymn \n
Throned in splendor, immortal Aphrodite! \n
Child of Zeus, Enchantress, I implore thee \n
Slay me not in this distress and anguish, \n
Lady of beauty. \n
Hither come as once before thou camest, \n
When from afar thou heard'st my voice lamenting, \n
Heard'st and camest, leaving thy glorious father's Palace golden, \n
Yoking thy chariot. Fair the doves that bore thee; \n
Swift to the darksome earth their course directing, \n
Waving their thick wings from the highest heaven \n
Down through the ether. \n
Quickly they came. Then thou, O blessed goddess, \n
All in smiling wreathed thy face immortal, \n
Bade me tell thee the cause of all my suffering, \n
Why now I called thee; \n
What for my maddened heart I most was longing. \n
"Whom," thou criest, "dost wish that sweet Persuasion \n
Now win over and lead to thy love, my Sappho? \n
Who is it wrongs thee? \n
"For, though now he flies, he soon shall follow, \n
Soon shall be giving gifts who now rejects them. \n
Even though now he love not, soon shall he love thee \n
Even though thou wouldst not." \n
Come then now, dear goddess, and release me \n
From my anguish. All my heart's desiring \n
Grant thou now. Now too again as aforetime, \n
Be thou my ally. \n<|endoftext|>
hymn \n
Science! thou fair effusive ray \n
From the great source of mental day, \n
Free, generous, and refin'd! \n
Descend with all thy treasures fraught, \n
Illumine each bewilder'd thought, \n
And bless my lab'ring mind. \n
But first with thy resistless light, \n
Disperse those phantoms from my sight, \n
Those mimic shades of thee; \n
The scholiast's learning, sophist's cant, \n
The visionary bigot's rant, \n
The monk's philosophy. \n
O! let thy powerful charms impart \n
The patient head, the candid heart, \n
Devoted to thy sway; \n
Which no weak passions e'er mislead, \n
Which still with dauntless steps proceed \n
Where Reason points the way. \n
Give me to learn each secret cause; \n
Let number's, figure's, motion's laws \n
Reveal'd before me stand; \n
These to great Nature's scenes apply, \n
And round the globe, and thro' the sky, \n
Disclose her working hand. \n
Next, to thy nobler search resign'd, \n
The busy, restless, human mind \n
Thro' ev'ry maze pursue; \n
Detect Perception where it lies, \n
Catch the ideas as they rise, \n
And all their changes view. \n
Say from what simple springs began \n
The vast, ambitious thoughts of man, \n
Which range beyond control; \n
Which seek Eternity to trace, \n
Dive thro' th' infinity of space, \n
And strain to grasp the whole. \n
Her secret stores let Memory tell, \n
Bid Fancy quit her fairy cell, \n
In all her colours drest; \n
While prompt her sallies to control, \n
Reason, the judge, recalls the soul \n
To Truth's severest test. \n
Then launch thro' Being's wide extent; \n
Let the fair scale, with just ascent, \n
And cautious steps, be trod; \n
And from the dead, corporeal mass, \n
Thro' each progressive order pass \n
To Instinct, Reason, God. \n
There, Science! veil thy daring eye; \n
Nor dive too deep, nor soar too high, \n
In that divine abyss; \n
To Faith content thy beams to lend, \n
Her hopes t' assure, her steps befriend, \n
And light her way to bliss. \n
Then downwards take thy flight agen; \n
Mix with the policies of men, \n
And social nature's ties: \n
The plan, the genius of each state, \n
Its interest and its pow'rs relate, \n
Its fortunes and its rise. \n
Thro' private life pursue thy course, \n
Trace every action to its source, \n
And means and motives weigh: \n
Put tempers, passions in the scale, \n
Mark what degrees in each prevail, \n
And fix the doubtful sway. \n
That last, best effort of thy skill, \n
To form the life, and rule the will, \n
Propitious pow'r! impart: \n
Teach me to cool my passion's fires, \n
Make me the judge of my desires, \n
The master of my heart. \n
Raise me above the vulgar's breath, \n
Pursuit of fortune, fear of death, \n
And all in life that's mean. \n
Still true to reason be my plan, \n
Still let my action speak the man, \n
Thro' every various scene. \n
Hail! queen of manners, light of truth; \n
Hail! charm of age, and guide of youth; \n
Sweet refuge of distress: \n
In business, thou! exact, polite; \n
Thou giv'st Retirement its delight, \n
Prosperity its grace. \n
Of wealth, pow'r, freedom, thou! the cause; \n
Foundress of order, cities, laws, \n
Of arts inventress, thou! \n
Without thee what were human kind? \n
How vast their wants, their thoughts how blind! \n
Their joys how mean! how few! \n
Sun of the soul! thy beams unveil! \n
Let others spread the daring sail, \n
On Fortune's faithless sea; \n
While undeluded, happier I \n
From the vain tumult timely fly, \n
And sit in peace with thee. \n<|endoftext|>

Within a dream \n
Imagine! \n
Tireless traveler \n
Deserts of vast Eternity \n
Of your dry silence \n
Without the silence changing \n
You may forever tarry \n
It’s a puzzle \n
Far off from me it is taken \n
My heart \n
But I am no more \n
And now my heart is sore \n
Like a chain on a bicycle \n

Hearts go bad \n
The riotous glass houses built on rock \n

Traced in the shadow \n

Quick little splinters of life \n

Stirring away from something hot \n

Life, believe, is not a dream \n
I lift my lids and all is born again \n
We share life’s joys when sober \n
I shall go on living \n
The heart has not stopped \n
I must not allow myself to disappear \n
In a wasteland of thorns \n
Alone in your lonesome dynasty \n
I want to be looking at them when they come \n
The doors of life \n
Lights, \n
Which will one day find \n
Everything \n
Very quietly \n
Give me truths, \n
While I am I, and you are you, \n
Because I love to live \n
And sing and laugh, and deny nothing \n
So winter closed its fist \n
To the waters. But I’m sure \n
A cold glitter of souls \n
Shinning like a wet stone in the rain \n
Will open wide the gates of her high palace hall. \n
Into the future, let what will be, be. \n

epithalamion \n
Hark, hearer, hear what I do; lend a thought now, make believe \n
We are leafwhelmed somewhere with the hood \n
Of some branchy bunchy bushybowered wood, \n
Southern dene or Lancashire clough or Devon cleave, \n
That leans along the loins of hills, where a candycoloured, where a gluegold-brown \n
Marbled river, boisterously beautiful, between \n
Roots and rocks is danced and dandled, all in froth and waterblowballs, down. \n
We are there, when we hear a shout \n
That the hanging honeysuck, the dogeared hazels in the cover \n
Makes dither, makes hover \n
And the riot of a rout \n
Of, it must be, boys from the town \n
Bathing: it is summer’s sovereign good. \n
By there comes a listless stranger: beckoned by the noise \n
He drops towards the river: unseen \n
Sees the bevy of them, how the boys \n
With dare and with downdolphinry and bellbright bodies huddling out, \n
Are earthworld, airworld, waterworld thorough hurled, all by turn and turn about. \n
This garland of their gambols flashes in his breast \n
Into such a sudden zest \n
Of summertime joys \n
That he hies to a pool neighbouring; sees it is the best \n
There; sweetest, freshest, shadowiest; \n
Fairyland; silk-beech, scrolled ash, packed sycamore, wild wychelm, hornbeam fretty overstood \n
By. Rafts and rafts of flake-leaves light, dealt so, painted on the air, \n
Hang as still as hawk or hawkmoth, as the stars or as the angels there, \n
Like the thing that never knew the earth, never off roots \n
Rose. Here he feasts: lovely all is! No more: off with—down he dings \n
His bleachèd both and woolwoven wear: \n
Careless these in coloured wisp \n
All lie tumbled-to; then with loop-locks \n
Forward falling, forehead frowning, lips crisp \n
Over finger-teasing task, his twiny boots \n
Fast he opens, last he offwrings \n
Till walk the world he can with bare his feet \n
And come where lies a coffer, burly all of blocks \n
Built of chancequarrièd, selfquainèd rocks \n
And the water warbles over into, filleted with glassy grassy quicksilvery shivès and shoots \n
And with heavenfallen freshness down from moorland still brims, \n
Dark or daylight on and on. Here he will then, here he will the fleet \n
Flinty kindcold element let break across his limbs \n
Long. Where we leave him, froliclavish while he looks about him, laughs, swims. \n
Enough now; since the sacred matter that I mean \n
I should be wronging longer leaving it to float \n
Upon this only gambolling and echoing-of-earth note— \n
What is … the delightful dene? \n
Wedlock. What the water? Spousal love. \n

She drew a name full of winning flesh, \n
Victory, I mean, so that any Yes she has to say \n

And he drew a name large as any god, \n
Large as a wall in the center of the night, and as calm, \n
God in the most gracious, the tenderest way. \n
To be, like them, in a tenderness now, \n
Chill as April; to feel ourselves, like themselves, \n
In a communion of that sprung blood; and to trust \n
That in the dark, in even the wild, forbidding dark \n
Which by fact must come, is no threat, \n
No sudden evidence to break and unheat— \n
Then we're complete. Flesh falls away. Gods do. \n
I will make a man out of you, says one \n
To the other. I will make a woman. Isn't that \n
What to say I choose you means, means I let go \n
The name I held only for myself to step sharply into yours, \n
Into that bareness each for the other makes, \n
Outside the old conceptions, the old laws, \n
No she, no he—but together you become a single self \n
That spans the sense of the imagination, \n
Wiser than the oldest language, which is love, \n
More patient than the deepest song. \n<|endoftext|>
busta-sonetto \n
How lonely is the night, without a companion \n
She shares her life with the day, now asleep \n
Yet whilst she sleeps, he opens half a world \n
And during her vigil has been unable to peep, \n
Covered with a blanket, and a different opinion. \n
With the first sign of day you hear welcome calls \n
And all forms of life burst forth with joyous sound \n
That night has done her best to see unfurled. \n
So some politics would claim the same around \n
That only day should grace their hallowed walls. \n
I wonder how long they would last without a night \n
And the pleasure that a short hibernation creates; \n
Lying in bed asleep sharing your time as mates \n
A comfortable partner, sharing beliefs and rights? \n

Though the sun sets only once a year where we’re from, I miss it when it’s gone, and it seems that the night is prolonged until she rises again -lasting beyond eternity, and then beauty I cannot see. The rainbow does not show in the dark, and stars lose their allure after 100; you cannot count them all and that, is no mystery. It is so cold that hips forget their dance and legs cross to keep their warmth, lips chap, and food loses appeal. \n
To ensure sun never sets again, daily I’ll waddle the wilderness of fortune until I find a suitable rock that I shall lay at your feet and cross for approval. And I will look to sun for its setting and if it were to begin descent, I will follow it and it shall not rid of me. I shall stay. Home will be comfort and you will have my trust, even when you leave me in the cold. \n

prose-poem \n
There is no contradiction between objective science and subjective science of spirituality. In fact, they are complimentary to one another, and are essential for the development of full potential of a person. Cultivation of one without the other makes a person handicapped. An intellectual man lacking in spirituality is like a legs-amputee on a wheel chair, and a spiritually competent man without scientific insights is like a blind man with a white cane. Here is the story of two such handicapped young men lost in a dense forest, and how they came out of this depressing situation upon meeting and joining their hands. \n
A Tale of Two Handicapped Youngman \n
I am about to tell you all an interesting tale \n
Of two handicapped young men \n
Drawn to each other on their first meeting \n
Not due to love at first sight \n
But due to an imminent mutual interests \n
That rapidly flashed in both minds on contact \n
And the enlightening story is described as follows \n
One young man is legs-amputee on wheel chair \n
Calling himself as Science by name \n
The other is childhood-blind, strong young man \n
Calling himself as Spirituality \n
And the amputee sensed Scientist from afar \n
With his supernatural senses \n
Thus they met in the dense forest being lost \n
Both figured out what is needed from other \n
And agreed even prior to dialogue \n
So, Science sat on the shoulder of Spirituality \n
With his eyes serving as their guide \n
And started to get out of the thick Forest fast \n
Leaving sun behind going toward east \n
Since the village of Science lays on east-side \n
Hoping to reach there before sundown \n
Along their escape route they began to enjoy \n
Everything akin to the soulmates reunited \n
With the acute senses of Spirituality bound to \n
The clear-vision of Science around - \n
Enjoying hide-and-seek games of forest Sun \n
With dancing greeneries, sparkling holes \n
Echoing flying ducks on sky above \n
Humming birds and bees mowing forest lawn \n
Beehives, cuckoos and monkeys on branches \n
Both enjoyed all of those and much more \n
Both skilled handyman shared life-experiences too \n
Spirituality said enjoying a safe life in bliss \n
Until this event of meeting Science after getting lost \n
But his briefly lost bliss is back again \n
Science said, being at peace, but suffered prior to \n
Following loss of both his legs at age five \n
Depression worsening each day until last summit \n
Thanking God, he is in full peace now! \n
There is a similar story told by a blossomed Lotus: \n
Until blossoming out of water it was blissful \n
Along its upwards trip from its muddy roots \n
Growing under calm water and swimming all along \n
It had ample fun in peace and tranquility \n
While its soul enjoyed deep bliss within \n
But bliss gradually vanished and anxiety took over \n
Soon its blossoming started above surface! \n
Revealing, survival-science and Spirituality concur \n
And both are essential for enjoyable life \n
Thus it should be pointed out that- - \n
All soul fall in this category \n
Excepting the very few born-wise Avatars \n
All are born to learn from the schooling-of-life \n
Learning to use our mind-body-intellect properly \n
Always maintaining a balanced-state \n
With open-heart and an open-mind \n
To enjoy a blissful life in mind-body harmony: \n
This is the Vedantic Truth, not an allegory! \n
prose-poem \n
The morning coffee. I'm not sure why I drink it. Maybe it's the ritual \n
of the cup, the spoon, the hot water, the milk, and the little heap of \n
brown grit, the way they come together to form a nail I can hang the \n
day on. It's something to do between being asleep and being awake. \n
Surely there's something better to do, though, than to drink a cup of \n

coffee. A cup of coffee whose first drink is too hot and whose last drink \n
is too cool, but whose many in-between drinks are, like Baby Bear's por- \n
ridge, just right. Papa Bear looks disgruntled. He removes his spectacles \n
and swivels his eyes onto the cup that sits before Baby Bear, and then, \n
after a discrete cough, reaches over and picks it up. Baby Bear doesn't \n
understand this disruption of the morning routine. Papa Bear brings \n
the cup close to his face and peers at it intently. The cup shatters in his \n
paw, explodes actually, sending fragments and brown liquid all over the \n
room. In a way it's good that Mama Bear isn't there. Better that she rest \n
in her grave beyond the garden, unaware of what has happened to the \n
world. \n<|endoftext|>

'Yes. Green was her husband's favorite color.He preferred the shutters green. It was the sign she sought'. \n
'I see', said Eileen, not really thrilled by this example from literature. \n
'You don't believe it'? \n
'I have to think about it. It sounds a little hokey. \n
I tried to appear shocked, but I'm not very good at it. \n

prose-poem \n
Leave such stupidity of forcefully violating, grasping and abusing the power, \n
Leave such inhumanity of illegally snatching the rights of other, \n
Leave such mentality of backing to the ancient caves of terror and horror; \n
Cheating all other you are accustomed to live on the livings of other \n
Your living, dress, food, fashion and style spread a nasty odor, \n
People in general hate that odor spreads crime, corruptions with devilish tar; \n
So, you do not keep any good relation with your opponent, anyhow \n
Rather you loose crimes and corruptions more than you were committing \n
Illegally oppose, arrest the innocent citizens and opponent legally living; \n
As you are in power people in general normally show you an honor \n
It is not to the person you are but to the post and position bearing you \n
Remember, every sign of power corrupting and committing wrongs in you; \n
People in general are just the citizens legally living on the occupations \n
If you legally find faults with them, they won't object you to charge of them; \n
But, as illegality is your very dress, you are on violating power any case. \n

Ideas come and go, \n
Slipping through my grasp, \n
They dance heel and toe, \n
Elusive as an asp. \n
Sometimes they'll come again \n
So I have one more chance \n
To hold tightly to them \n
As through my mind they dance. \n
Poetry's like breathing, \n
Because you're grasping air, \n
Entering and leaving, \n
To find there's nothing there. \n
Poems become prosaic \n
And it's truly tragic \n
When a poem's mosaic \n

prose-poem \n
So the dog slept in front of the couch. The old couple somehow managed the place. With pension. A MacDonald was there beside their farm. The only one. \n
And the huge place looked very scary at night. Small escape roots from the great freedom mingled out at night. \n
And the farm land of corn looked like an open terrace at night. The only one. \n
Face your fear.. the old couple used to say. \n
And courage stared at the t.v. and giggled. \n
There was a airbase which you can find nearby. The only one. \n

prose-poem \n
I look at you in helpless silence, incapable of doing \n
a thing for you. In the middle of the white-washed walls \n
of the hospital ward you lie, groaning quietly in the dark abyss of pain. \n
Only a miracle can bring you some relief. I have nothing to offer, \n
but a prayer. All my prayers reach the Almighty, an attempt I shall make. \n
I am trying to find ways to shake off His unbearable silence. \n
Desolation and numbness in your eyes drive me crazy and as \n
I leave the ward quietly, I hear the footsteps of death. I want to \n
cut off my ears to block their sound. But will that delay the advent of death? \n
From your voicelessness before death, I move towards your silence \n
after death - and I do not even want to feel angry or shed tears \n
at my helplessness. \n<|endoftext|>

My Brazil Trip \n
I went to Brazil and boy was I excited sleeping in youth hostels and walking the beach in Rio holding on to my Christian values and not looking at the lovely ladies in their barely there bikinis. The German guy I shared a room with at one hostel was kind of a creep lying around all day smoking dope but I did not let it get me to sin. I took a charter boat up the Amazon and I felt how small I was on that mighty wide river, symbol of God's power, but I didn't catch sight of any piranha flesh eating fish that symbolize Satan. Back in Rio Christ on the mountain reminded me of how I am of the Lord and by faith I am promised immortality. \n<|endoftext|>

Don't bother the earth spirit. She \n
Loves writing delicate changing stories. \n
She will invite you for a coffee, if you so will \n
She will give you warm bread so you stay to listen \n
You will have to endure earthquakes, lightenings, hurricanes \n
And the death of those you love, the most blinding beauty \n
That's how she traps you, the spirit of the earth \n
That's why you never ever want to leave her \n
See that stone finger over there? \n
That is the only one who ever escaped. \n<|endoftext|>
prose-poem \n
On the map it is precise and rectilinear as a chessboard, though driving past you would hardly notice it, this boundary line or ragged margin, a shallow swale that cups a simple trickle of water, less rill than rivulet, more gully than dell, a tangled ditch grown up throughout with a fearsome assortment of wildflowers and bracken. There is no fence, though here and there a weathered post asserts a former claim, strands of fallen wire taken by the dust. To the left a cornfield carries into the distance, dips and rises to the blue sky, a rolling plain of green and healthy plants aligned in close order, row upon row upon row. To the right, a field of wheat, a field of hay, young grasses breaking the soil, filling their allotted land with the rich, slow-waving spectacle of their grain. As for the farmers, they are, for the most part, indistinguishable: here the tractor is red, there yellow; here a pair of dirty hands, there a pair of dirty hands. They are cultivators of the soil. They grow crops by pattern, by acre, by foresight, by habit. What corn is to one, wheat is to the other, and though to some eyes the similarities outweigh the differences it would be as unthinkable for the second to commence planting corn as for the first to switch over to wheat. What happens in the gully between them is no concern of theirs, they say, so long as the plough stays out, the weeds stay in the ditch where they belong, though anyone would notice the wind-sewn cornstalks poking up their shaggy ears like young lovers run off into the bushes, and the kinship of these wild grasses with those the farmer cultivates is too obvious to mention, sage and dun-colored stalks hanging their noble heads, hoarding exotic burrs and seeds, and yet it is neither corn nor wheat that truly flourishes there, nor some jackalopian hybrid of the two. What grows in that place is possessed of a beauty all its own, ramshackle and unexpected, even in winter, when the wind hangs icicles from the skeletons of briars and small tracks cross the snow in search of forgotten grain; in the spring the little trickle of water swells to welcome frogs and minnows, a muskrat, a family of turtles, nesting doves in the verdant grass; in summer it is a thoroughfare for raccoons and opossums, field mice, swallows and black birds, migrating egrets, a passing fox; in autumn the geese avoid its abundance, seeking out windrows of toppled stalks, fatter grain more quickly discerned, more easily digested. Of those that travel the local road, few pay that fertile hollow any mind, even those with an eye for what blossoms, vetch and timothy, early forsythia, the fatted calf in the fallow field, the rabbit running for cover, the hawk's descent from the lightning-struck tree. You've passed this way yourself many times, and can tell me, if you would, do the formal fields end where the valley begins, or does everything that surrounds us emerge from its embrace? \n<|endoftext|>

Half-past on the 9:07 local to New Haven, the Bronx \n
tenements pent in vaguely post-apocalyptic paragraphs \n
rushing past too fast to cohere into prose, leaving loops \n
of graffiti, marred and boarded windows, a hoops game \n
glowing yellowish in the mercury vapor of street lights, \n
a Pontiac Bonneville, tireless, jacked up on cinder blocks. \n

Riding a train embodies democracy. Not like cramped, \n
dank seats of a bus or on the highway where cars mark \n
the demographic by make and model, here everything \n
is equalized, time and space included. The post-punk \n
pierced girl, ears plugged with music, sits next to a man, \n
silk cravat loosened, fixated on his snuff box, providing \n
the grand illusion of temporal continuity, the centuries \n
stacked one on top of the other, a set of encyclopedias. \n

They have nothing \n

Die and decay. \n

Crafted on humanism and not be self centred. \n

Propounded by selfless towering personalities. \n

"Very much so. \n
From beginning to end. \n
Although I have to admit, \n
The trailer for the new one... \n
Coming out later this year. \n
Was too long." \n
We should have been warned. \n
A three hour long trailer? \n
And... \n
The producers say, \n
They are a few months away... \n
From completing it. \n
"I agree. \n
At least prepare the viewer, \n
As to what to expect. \n
I wonder why, \n
It's being called 'Epic Failure'. \n
The actors are really into their characters. \n
So real and life like. \n
Especially the one moaning and groaning. \n
Throwing tantrums like a child." \n
Well played too. \n
But those staged conflicts? \n
And division created between the races. \n
To be filmed like a documentary? \n
For me? \n
That was too nerve wrecking. \n
Until they began focusing, \n
On the scene stealer. \n
"I noticed that too! \n
Charming, captivating. \n
And also wicked at the same time. \n
Everyone around us started applauding. \n
That... \n
I didn't understand at all." \n
I did. \n
"You did? \n
How? Why? " \n
Even though the trailer was long. \n
I noticed... \n
That same scene stealer, \n
Would always say nothing was wrong. \n
And everyone was imagining it. \n
Setting the audience up for, \n
Something they had never experience before. \n
"Oh... \n
I get it now. \n
It begins like a comedy. \n
Then slowly adds the drama. \n
To become a mysterious thriller. \n
But why would they call it, \n
'Epic Failure? '" \n
We'll have to wait and see. \n
I bet towards the end, \n
Of the completed movie. \n
Aliens from out of space, \n
Will be used as a distraction. \n
Shocking everybody. \n
To leave them screaming. \n
Running away. \n
"No. \n
What sense would that make? " \n
Think about it. \n
People love horror movies. \n
And with special effects, \n
Adding spaceships and aliens too. \n
I bet that's why this movie, \n
Is taking so long to finish it. \n
Shocking people around the World. \n
"That's if they haven't been bored to death, \n
By that ego childish tantrum thrower. \n
Maybe the producers are considering, \n
Replacing that character all together. \n
And if they don't? \n
That would be the only reason, \n
To call the movie what I think it will be. \n
And that to me, \n
Would be an appropriate title." \n
Who knows? \n
We all have to wait and see what happens. \n<|endoftext|>

We obey a multiplicity of superstitions \n
and thus survive with a tuft of hair \n
on our head and an ancient heard! \n
Thus surviving we are about to die, \n
O Sabyasachi! Give us something \n
so that we may die and live! \n

In Indian tradition she educated \n
An active argumentative talented \n
Where she gained wisdom through knowledge \n
Where she gained acclaims for scholarship \n

Thousands of years back the epic story \n

Where women's education, scholarship vital \n
In all spheres of life, occasion, administration \n
May a good tomorrow of world we aspire \n
Sound judgement from wisdom of knowledge \n
Sound heart the women carries in life \n

epic \n
A Lion in his jaws caught up a child-- \n
Not harming it--and to the woodland, wild \n
With secret streams and lairs, bore off his prey-- \n
The beast, as one might cull a bud in May. \n
It was a rosy boy, a king's own pride, \n
A ten-year lad, with bright eyes shining wide, \n
And save this son his majesty beside \n
Had but one girl, two years of age, and so \n
The monarch suffered, being old, much woe; \n
His heir the monster's prey, while the whole land \n
In dread both of the beast and king did stand; \n
Sore terrified were all. \n
By came a knight \n
That road, who halted, asking, 'What's the fright?' \n
They told him, and he spurred straight for the site! \n
The beast was seen to smile ere joined they fight, \n
The man and monster, in most desperate duel, \n
Like warring giants, angry, huge, and cruel. \n
Stout though the knight, the lion stronger was, \n
And tore that brave breast under its cuirass, \n
Scrunching that hero, till he sprawled, alas! \n
Beneath his shield, all blood and mud and mess: \n
Whereat the lion feasted: then it went \n
Back to its rocky couch and slept content. \n
Sudden, loud cries and clamors! striking out \n
Qualm to the heart of the quiet, horn and shout \n
Causing the solemn wood to reel with rout. \n
Terrific was this noise that rolled before; \n
It seemed a squadron; nay, 'twas something more-- \n
A whole battalion, sent by that sad king \n
With force of arms his little prince to bring, \n
Together with the lion's bleeding hide. \n
Which here was right or wrong? Who can decide? \n
Have beasts or men most claim to live? God wots! \n
He is the unit, we the cipher-dots. \n
Ranged in the order a great hunt should have, \n
They soon between the trunks espy the cave. \n
'Yes, that is it! the very mouth of the den!' \n
The trees all round it muttered, warning men; \n
Still they kept step and neared it. Look you now, \n
Company's pleasant, and there were a thou-- \n
Good Lord! all in a moment, there's its face! \n
Frightful! they saw the lion! Not one pace \n
Further stirred any man; but bolt and dart \n
Made target of the beast. He, on his part, \n
As calm as Pelion in the rain or hail, \n
Bristled majestic from the teeth to tail, \n
And shook full fifty missiles from his hide, \n
But no heed took he; steadfastly he eyed, \n
And roared a roar, hoarse, vibrant, vengeful, dread, \n
A rolling, raging peal of wrath, which spread, \n
Making the half-awakened thunder cry, \n
'Who thunders there?' from its black bed of sky. \n
This ended all! Sheer horror cleared the coast; \n
As fogs are driven by the wind, that valorous host \n
Melted, dispersed to all the quarters four, \n
Clean panic-stricken by that monstrous roar. \n
Then quoth the lion, 'Woods and mountains, see, \n
A thousand men, enslaved, fear one beast free!' \n
He followed towards the hill, climbed high above, \n
Lifted his voice, and, as the sowers sow \n
The seed down wind, thus did that lion throw \n
His message far enough the town to reach: \n
'King! your behavior really passes speech! \n
Thus far no harm I've wrought to him your son; \n
But now I give you notice--when night's done, \n
I will make entry at your city-gate, \n
Bringing the prince alive; and those who wait \n
To see him in my jaws--your lackey-crew-- \n
Shall see me eat him in your palace, too!' \n
Next morning, this is what was viewed in town: \n
Dawn coming--people going--some adown \n
Praying, some crying; pallid cheeks, swift feet, \n
And a huge lion stalking through the street. \n
It seemed scarce short of rash impiety \n
To cross its path as the fierce beast went by. \n
So to the palace and its gilded dome \n
With stately steps unchallenged did he roam; \n
He enters it--within those walls he leapt! \n
No man! \n
For certes, though he raged and wept, \n
His majesty, like all, close shelter kept, \n
Solicitous to live, holding his breath \n
Specially precious to the realm. Now death \n
Is not thus viewed by honest beasts of prey; \n
And when the lion found _him_ fled away, \n
Ashamed to be so grand, man being so base, \n
He muttered to himself, 'A wretched king! \n
'Tis well; I'll eat his boy!' Then, wandering, \n
Lordly he traversed courts and corridors, \n
Paced beneath vaults of gold on shining floors, \n
Glanced at the throne deserted, stalked from hall \n
To hall--green, yellow, crimson--empty all! \n
Rich couches void, soft seats unoccupied! \n
And as he walked he looked from side to side \n
To find some pleasant nook for his repast, \n
Since appetite was come to munch at last \n
The princely morsel!--Ah! what sight astounds \n
That grisly lounger? \n
In the palace grounds \n
An alcove on a garden gives, and there \n
A tiny thing--forgot in the general fear, \n
Lulled in the flower-sweet dreams of infancy, \n
Bathed with soft sunlight falling brokenly \n
Through leaf and lattice--was at that moment waking; \n
A little lovely maid, most dear and taking, \n
The prince's sister--all alone, undressed-- \n
She sat up singing: children sing so best. \n
Charming this beauteous baby-maid; and so \n
The beast caught sight of her and stopped-- \n
And then \n
Entered--the floor creaked as he stalked straight in. \n
Above the playthings by the little bed \n
The lion put his shaggy, massive head, \n
Dreadful with savage might and lordly scorn, \n
More dreadful with that princely prey so borne; \n
Which she, quick spying, 'Brother, brother!' cried, \n
'Oh, my own brother!' and, unterrified, \n
She gazed upon that monster of the wood, \n
Whose yellow balls not Typhon had withstood, \n
And--well! who knows what thoughts these small heads hold? \n
She rose up in her cot--full height, and bold, \n
And shook her pink fist angrily at him. \n
Whereon--close to the little bed's white rim, \n
All dainty silk and laces--this huge brute \n
Set down her brother gently at her foot, \n
Just as a mother might, and said to her, \n
'Don't be put out, now! There he is, dear, there!' \n<|endoftext|>

1. Vyasa, the creator of Mahabharata approached Lord Ganesha, a great scribe who could write with great speed, to pen down the epic as sung by him. He agreed but warned the poet: With great speed I write. See that you do not make me wait. ‘Okay, but don't write anything down without understanding it, the poet put a counter condition. And so was created an epic of about hundred thousand verses, or four hundred thousand poetic lines. \n
2. I have done a poetic translation from the original Sanskrit (Volume I published)and I know how formidable a task it is. \n
This is a Villanelle— a bit way out. The tersest, that normally becomes a quatrain only in the last stanza, becomes so in all. Also, the first and the third lines of the first stanza are repeated here with some modifications. \n

In the concrete jungle, where drugs slang to maintain the bloody crane \n
Their lives always been this way, always looking over their shoulder \n
The dried tears washed away with blood from the most potent culture \n
The concrete jungle feeds off blood, the people are use to seeing torture \n
That’s why our bodies flood in the mud that’s been their lives \n
The ammo their gun holds, their caliber \n
Seems more important to them than learning their algebra \n
It’s all about street smarts, survival, and loyalty from their live crew \n
When the wind blew what unravel was no one that were fake \n
Real people live life on the corner, surrounding them is killers at their wake \n
The reader from afar opens a book of a tragedy, the truth in the streets \n
As he opens the book, he could hear his heart beat rumbling like clapping feet \n
As he opens the book, he reads the untold scripture, nightmares he will soon greet \n
L-Dub was his name, he lived on the streets, and he was deep in the crack game \n
All it gave him was lack of mental power and emotional pain \n
But he had peers alongside him; he didn’t know such thing as fear \n
They hosted a block party alongside him, only a few cars could enter \n
Music was loud and it was crowded, barbecue was fed drugs at the rear \n
Lastly gambling in the back of the shack where L-Dub rest at \n
In the back, Frank was mad he was losing his bank in the card game \n
He felt like a lame drinking all night, was no closer to fame \n

David and Elaine’s Epic Birthday \n
Battle May 2007 \n
David: Said Cupid to \n
The Wounded Maid, \n
'Why must my darts \n
You still evade? \n
For there is balm \n
In my swift shafts \n
To soothe and calm \n
A lover's wrath; \n
Let me lance your wound \n
With words \n
Of subtle honey \n
And healing herbs, \n
And in so doing \n
Heal your heart; \n
Come bare your breast, \n
Receive my Art.' \n
Come sweet Cybele \n
Please hold still \n
My aim is poor, \n
My eyesight nil, \n
I would relieve \n
Thy grieving pain, \n
But for the fact \n
I have no aim; \n
It seems \n
I accidentally shot \n
A monkey, \n
And have two sons: \n
A mule and donkey. \n
Elaine: A birthday arrow has been sent, \n
It's aim secure the bow's been bent. \n
My target one poetic steed, \n
The potion, happiness to breed. \n
You can't escape the wishes passed \n
When day is done you'll feel harassed! \n
David: You target me \n
Oh, giddy Maid, \n
Come taste the nectar \n
Of my blade, \n
As you harry \n
As you strike, \n
I parry you, \n
In combat tight; \n
I cross my sword \n
Against your blade; \n
Your eyes are green \n
Of Chinese Jade! \n
Elaine: My eyes are green \n
But so's my face \n
Ive got the flu \n
its makeup paste \n
Your challenge on \n
I'll take the quest \n
A giddy maid \n
To be your guest. \n
Upon this scene \n
I shall be strong \n
Poetic charm \n
your birthday song. \n
I heard the shot \n
The rhyming gun. \n
This noble fight \n
I think I've won! \n
David: Oh giddy, bouncing, ebullient girl, \n
You leap, you twist, you jump, you twirl; \n
You thrust, you dart, you stab the air, \n
You wave your sword so debonair; \n
I stand composed and simply marvel \n
Such energy in a rival; \n
Come closer now, please engage, \n
Your alacrity I would assuage; \n
I cut to ribbons your black dress, \n
Now there's a pose that does impress. \n
Elaine: Poetic scholar you're first class! \n
A diamond tongue to cut through glass. \n
Unprepared I seem to be, \n
My new black dress a May Day tree. \n
Undaunted I shall stay awhile, \n
A ribbon dance in modern style. \n
A chariot of birthday fare \n
Brought me clothed now I'm bare \n
Though I need to sing your song \n
The tinsel dress will show my thong. \n
I smile so bright and curtsy dance, \n
To remove the belt around your pants. \n
Now hold my hands as we parlay, \n
And let the pants fall where they may! \n
David: Now you've done it, my new Levi jeans, \n
You've slashed the rivets at the seams, \n
I'll have to clutch my pant loops \n
And defend my honor while they droop; \n
i weave and parry while on my cuffs, \n
Your boasts and threats are so much fluff \n
I see you wear a garter belt, \n
I hope this blow doesn't cause a welt. \n
Your dress so cut and slashed to ribbons \n
I see you move like Lisa Gibbons, \n
You may be dancing with the stars, \n
But I think it best we not go too far; \n
Others watching might be mocking, \n
I'll just put a run in your stocking. \n
Elaine: A bit of fluff he says of ME? \n
Its lining of the May Day tree. \n
Your Levi's now will have a GAP, \n
The rivets are not in your lap. \n
Perhaps suspenders work the best \n
And give your hands to me to rest. \n
A garter belt is all you see, ...? \n
You must have blinked..oh lucky me! \n
The welts and bruises that you find \n
Match my flu-like state of mind. \n
The birthday game just lasts one day \n
It really is your chance to play. \n
So tell me David will you dance... \n
Even if you have no pants? \n<|endoftext|>
epic \n
The conditions of the banishment of the sons of Pandu were hard. They \n
must pass twelve years in exile, and then they must remain a year in \n
concealment. If they were discovered within this last year, they must \n
go into exile for another twelve years. \n
Having passed the twelve years of exile in forests, the Pandav \n
brothers disguised themselves and entered into the menial service \n
of Virata, king of the Matsyas, to pass the year of concealment. \n
Yudhishthir presented himself as a Brahman, skilled in dice, and \n
became a courtier of the king. Bhima entered the king's service \n
as cook. For Arjun, who was so well known, a stricter concealment \n
was necessary. He wore conch bangles and earrings and braided \n
his hair, like those unfortunate beings whom nature has debarred \n
from the privileges of men and women, and he lived in the inner \n
apartments of the king. He assumed the name of _Brihannala_, and \n
taught the inmates of the royal household in music and dancing. \n
Nakula became a keeper of the king's horses, and Sahadeva took \n
charge of the king's cows. Draupadi too disguised herself as a \n
waiting-woman, and served the princess of the Matsya house in that \n
humble capacity. \n
In these disguises the Pandav brothers safely passed a year in \n
concealment in spite of all search which Duryodhan made after them. \n
At last an incident happened which led to their discovery when the \n
year was out. \n
Cattle-lifting was a common practice with the kings of ancient India, \n
as with the chiefs of ancient Greece. The king of the Trigartas and \n
the king of the Kurus combined and fell on the king of the Matsyas \n
in order to drive off the numerous herd of fine cattle for which his \n
kingdom was famed. The Trigartas entered the Matsya kingdom from \n
the south-east, and while Virata went out with his troops to meet \n
the foe, Duryodhan with his Kuru forces fell on the kingdom from \n
the north. \n
When news came that the Kurus had invaded the kingdom, there was \n
no army in the capital to defend it. King Virata had gone out with \n
most of his troops to face the Trigartas in the south-east, and the \n
prince Uttara had no inclination to face the Kurus in the north. The \n
disguised Arjun now came to the rescue in the manner described in \n
this Book. The description of the bows, arrows, and swords of the \n
Pandav brothers which they had concealed in a tree, wrapped like \n
human corpses to frighten away inquisitive travellers, throws some \n
light on the arts and manufacture of ancient times. \n
I \n
Complaint of the Cowherd \n
Monarch of the mighty Matsyas, brave Virata known to fame, \n
Marched against Trigarta chieftains who from southward regions came, \n
From the north the proud Duryodhan, stealing onwards day by day, \n
Swooped on Matsya's fattened cattle like the hawk upon its prey! \n
Bhishma, Drona, peerless Karna, led the Kuru warriors brave, \n
Swept the kingdom of Virata like the ocean's surging wave, \n
Fell upon the trembling cowherds, chased them from the pasture-field, \n
Sixty thousand head of cattle was the Matsya country's yield! \n
And the wailing chief of cowherds fled forlorn, fatigued and spent, \n
Speeding on his rapid chariot to the royal city went, \n
Came inside the city portals, came within the palace gate, \n
Struck his forehead in his anguish and bewailed his luckless fate. \n
Meeting there the prince Uttara, youth of beauty and of fame, \n
Told him of the Kurus' outrage and lamented Matsya's shame: \n
'Sixty thousand head of cattle, bred of Matsya's finest breed, \n
To Hastina's distant empire do the Kuru chieftains lead! \n
Glory of the Matsya nation! save thy father's valued kine, \n
Quick thy footsteps, strong thy valour, vengeance deep and dire be thine! \n
'Gainst the fierce Trigarta chieftains Matsya's warlike king is gone, \n
Thee we count our lord and saviour as our monarch's gallant son! \n
Rise, Uttara! beat the Kurus, homeward lead the stolen kine, \n
Like an elephant of jungle, pierce the Kurus' shattered line! \n
As the _Vina_ speaketh music, by musicians tuned aright, \n
Let thy sounding bow and arrows speak thy deeds of matchless might! \n
Harness quick thy milk-white coursers to thy sounding battle-car, \n
Hoist thy golden lion-banner, speed thee, prince, unto the war! \n
And as thunder-wielding INDRA smote _asuras_ fierce and bold, \n
Smite the Kurus with thy arrows winged with plumes of yellow gold! \n
As the famed and warlike Arjun is the stay of Kuru's race, \n
Thou art refuge of the Matsyas and thy kingdom's pride and grace!' \n
But the prince went not to battle from the foe to guard the State, \n
To the cowherd answered gaily, sheltered by the palace gate: \n
'Not unknown to me the usage of the bow and winged dart, \n
Not unknown the warrior's duty or the warrior's noble art, \n
I would win my father's cattle from the wily foeman's greed, \n
If a skilful chariot-driver could my fiery coursers lead, \n
For my ancient chariot-driver died on battle's gory plain, \n
Eight and twenty days we wrestled, many warlike chiefs were slain! \n
Bring me forth a skilful driver who can urge the battle-steed, \n
I will hoist my lion-banner, to the dubious battle speed! \n
Dashing through the foeman's horses, ranks of elephant and car, \n
I will win the stolen cattle rescued in the field of war! \n
And like thunder-wielding INDRA, smiting Danu's sons of old, \n
I will smite the Kuru chieftains, drive them to their distant hold! \n
Bhishma and the proud Duryodhan, archer Karna known to fame, \n
Drona too shall quail before me and retreat in bitter shame! \n
Do those warriors in my absence Matsya's far-famed cattle steal? \n
But beneath my countless arrows Matsya's vengeance they shall feel! \n
Bring me forth a chariot-driver, let me speed my battle-car, \n
And in wonder they will question--Is this Arjun famed in war?' \n
II \n
The Disguised Charioteer \n
Arjun, guised as Brihannala, heard the boast Uttara made, \n
And to try his skill and valour, thus to fair Draupadi prayed: \n
'Say to him that Brihannala will his battle-chariot lead, \n
That as Arjun's chariot-driver he hath learned to urge the steed, \n
Say that faithful Brihannala many a dubious war hath seen, \n
And will win his father's cattle in this contest fierce and keen.' \n
Fair Draupadi, guised as menial, Arjun's secret hest obeyed, \n
Humbly stepped before Uttara and in gentle accents prayed: \n
'Hear me, prince! yon Brihannala will thy battle-chariot lead, \n
He was Arjun's chariot-driver, skilled to urge the flying steed, \n
Trained in war by mighty Arjun, trained to drive the battle-car, \n
He hath followed helmed Arjun in the glorious field of war, \n
And when Arjun conquered Khandav, this, Uttara, I have seen, \n
Brihannala drove his chariot, for I served Yudhishthir's queen.' \n
Heard Uttara hesitating, spake his faint and timid mind, \n
'I would trust thee, beauteous maiden, lotus-bosomed, ever kind, \n
But a poor and sexless creature, can he rein the warlike steed? \n
Can I ask him, worse than woman, in the battle's ranks to lead?' \n
'Need is none,' Draupadi answered, 'Brihannala's grace to ask, \n
He is eager like the war-horse for this great and warlike task! \n
And he waits upon thy sister, she will bid the minion speed, \n
And he wins thy father's cattle, and the victor's glorious meed!' \n
Matsya's princess spake to Arjun, Arjun led the battle-car, \n
Led the doubting prince Uttara to the dread and dubious war! \n
III \n
Arms and Weapons \n
Arjun drove the prince of Matsya to a darksome _sami_ tree, \n
Spake unto the timid warrior in his accents bold and free: \n
'Prince, thy bow and shining arrows, pretty handsome toys are these, \n
Scarcely they beseem a warrior, and a warrior cannot please! \n
Thou shalt find upon this _sami_, mark my words which never fail, \n
Stately bows and winged arrows, banners, swords and coats of mail! \n
And a bow which strongest warriors scarce can in the battle bend, \n
And the limits of a kingdom widen when that bow is strained! \n
Tall and slender like a palm-tree, worthy of a warrior bold, \n
Smooth the wood of hardened fibre, and the ends are yellow gold!' \n
Doubting still Uttara answered: 'In this _sami's_ gloomy shade \n
Corpses hang since many seasons, in their wrappings duly laid, \n
Now I mark them all suspended, horrent, in the open air, \n
And to touch the unclean objects, friend, is more than I can dare!' \n
'Fear not warrior,' Arjun answered, 'for the tree conceals no dead, \n
Warriors' weapons, cased like corpses, lurk within its gloomy shade, \n
And I ask thee, prince of Matsya, not to touch an unclean thing, \n
But unto a chief and warrior weapons and his arms to bring!' \n
Prince Uttara gently lighted, climbed the dark and leafy tree, \n
Arjun from the prince's chariot bade him speed the arms to free, \n
Then the young prince cut the wrappings and the shining bows appear \n
Twisted, voiced like hissing serpents, like the bright stars glistening \n
clear! \n
Seized with wonder prince Uttara silently the weapons eyed, \n
And unto his chariot-driver thus in trembling accents cried: \n
'Whose this bow so tall and stately, speak to me my gentle friend, \n
On the wood are golden bosses, tipped with gold at either end? \n
Whose this second ponderous weapon stout and massive in the hold, \n
On the staff are worked by artists elephants of burnished gold? \n
Sure some great and mighty monarch owns this other bow of might, \n
Set with golden glittering insects on its ebon back so bright? \n
Golden suns of wondrous brightness on this fourth their lustre lend, \n
Who may be the unknown archer who this stately bow can bend? \n
And the fifth is set with jewels, gems and stones of purest ray, \n
Golden fire-flies glint and sparkle in the yellow light of day! \n
Who doth own these shining arrows with their heads in gold encased, \n
Thousand arrows bright and feathered, in the golden quivers placed? \n
Next are these with vulture-feather, golden-yellow in their hue, \n
Made of iron, keen and whetted, whose may be these arrows true? \n
Next upon this sable quiver jungle tigers worked in gold, \n
And these keen and boar-eared arrows speak some chieftains fierce and bold! \n
Fourth are these seven hundred arrows, crescent is their shining blade, \n
Thirsting for the blood of foemen, and by cunning artists made! \n
And the fifth are golden-crested, made of tempered steel and bright, \n
Parrot feathers wing these arrows, whetted and of wondrous might! \n
Who doth own this wondrous sabre, shape of toad is on the hilt, \n
On the blade a toad is graven, and the scabbard nobly gilt? \n
Larger, stouter is this second in its sheath of tiger-skin, \n
Decked with bells and gold-surmounted, and the blade is bright and keen! \n
Next this scimitar so curious by the skilled _nishadas_ made, \n
Scabbard made of wondrous cowhide sheathes the bright and polished blade! \n
Fourth, a long and beauteous weapon glittering sable in its hue, \n
With its sheath of softer goat-skin worked with gold on azure blue! \n
And the fifth is broad and massive over thirty fingers long, \n
Golden-sheathed and gold embossed like a snake or fiery tongue!' \n
Joyously responded Arjun: 'Mark this bow embossed with gold, \n
'Tis the wondrous bow, _gandiva_, worthy of a warrior bold! \n
Gift of heaven! to archer Arjun kindly gods this weapon sent, \n
And the confines of a kingdom widen when the bow is bent! \n
Next, this mighty ponderous weapon worked with elephants of gold, \n
With this bow the stalwart Bhima hath the tide of conquests rolled! \n
And the third with golden insects by a cunning hand inlaid, \n
'Tis Yudhishthir's royal weapon by the noblest artists made! \n
Next the bow with solar lustre brave Nakula wields in fight, \n
And the fifth is Sahadeva's, decked with gems and jewels bright! \n
Listen, prince! these thousand arrows, unto Arjun they belong, \n
And the darts whose blades are crescent unto Bhima brave and strong, \n
Boar-ear shafts are young Nakula's, in the tiger-quiver cased, \n
Sahadeva owns the arrows with the parrot's feather graced, \n
These three-knotted shining arrows, thick and yellow vulture-plumed, \n
They belong to King Yudhishthir, with their heads by gold illumed. \n
Listen more! if of these sabres, prince of Matsya, thou wouldst know, \n
Arjun's sword is toad-engraven, ever dreaded by the foe! \n
And the sword in tiger-scabbard, massive and of mighty strength, \n
None save tiger-waisted Bhima wields that sword of wondrous length! \n
Next the sabre golden-hilted, sable and with gold embossed, \n
Brave Yudhishthir kept that sabre when the king his kingdom lost! \n
Yonder sword with goat-skin scabbard brave Nakula wields in war, \n
In the cowhide Sahadeva keeps his shining scimitar!' \n
'Strange thy accents,' spake Uttara, 'stranger are the weapons bright, \n
Are they arms of sons of Pandu famed on earth for matchless might? \n
Where are now those pious princes by a dire misfortune crossed, \n
Warlike Arjun, good Yudhishthir, by his subjects loved and lost? \n
Where is tiger-waisted Bhima, matchless fighter in the field, \n
And the brave and twin-born brothers skilled the arms of war to wield? \n
O'er a game they lost their empire, and we heard of them no more, \n
Or perchance they lonesome wander on some wild and distant shore! \n
And Draupadi noble princess, purest best of womankind, \n
Doth she wander with Yudhishthir, changeless in her heart and mind?' \n
Proudly answered valiant Arjun, and a smile was on his face, \n
'Not in distant lands the brothers do their wandering footsteps trace! \n
In thy father's court disguised lives Yudhishthir just and good, \n
Bhima in thy father's palace as a cook prepares the food! \n
Brave Nakula guards the horses, Sahadeva tends the kine, \n
As thy sister's waiting-woman doth the fair Draupadi shine! \n
_Pardon, prince, these rings and bangles, pardon strange unmanly guise, \n
'Tis no poor and sexless creature, Arjun greets thy wondering eyes!'_ \n
IV \n
Rescue of the Cattle \n
Arjun decked his mighty stature in the gleaming arms of war, \n
And with voice of distant thunder rolled the mighty battle-car! \n
And the Kurus marked with wonder Arjun's standard lifted proud, \n
Heard with dread the deep _gandiva_ sounding oft and sounding loud! \n
And they knew the wondrous bowman wheeling round the battle-car, \n
And with doubts and grave misgivings whispered Drona skilled in war: \n
'That is Arjun's monkey-standard, how it greets my ancient eyes! \n
Well the Kurus know the standard like a comet in the skies! \n
Hear ye not the deep _gandiva_? How my ear its accents greet! \n
Mark ye not these pointed arrows falling prone before my feet? \n
By these darts his salutation to his teacher loved of old, \n
Years of exile now completed, Arjun sends with greetings bold! \n
How the gallant prince advances! Now I mark his form and face, \n
Issuing from his dark concealment with a brighter, haughtier grace, \n
Well I know his bow and arrows and I know his standard well, \n
And the deep and echoing accents of his far-resounding shell! \n
In his shining arms accoutred, gleaming in his helmet dread, \n
Shines he like the flame of _homa_ by libations duly fed!' \n
Arjun marked the Kuru warriors arming for th' impending war, \n
Whispered thus to prince Uttara as he drove the battle-car: \n
'Stop thy steeds, O prince of Matsya! for too close we may not go, \n
Stop thy chariot whence my arrows reach and slay the distant foe, \n
Seek we out the Kuru monarch, proud Duryodhan let us meet, \n
If he falls we win the battle, other chieftains will retreat. \n
There is Drona my preceptor, Drona's warlike son is there, \n
Kripa and the mighty Bhishma, archer Karna, tall and fair, \n
Them I seek not in this battle, lead, O lead thy chariot far, \n
Midst the chiefs Duryodhan moves not, moves not in the ranks of war! \n
But to save the pilfered cattle speeds he onward in his fear, \n
While these warriors stay and tarry to defend their monarch's rear, \n
But I leave these car-borne warriors, other work to-day is mine, \n
Meet Duryodhan in the battle, win thy father's stolen kine!' \n
Matsya's prince then turned the courses, left behind the war's array, \n
Where Duryodhan with the cattle quickly held his onward way, \n
Kripa marked the course of Arjun, guessed his inmost thought aright, \n
Thus he spake to brother warriors urging speed and instant fight: \n
'Mark ye, chieftains, gallant Arjun wheels his sounding battle-car, \n
'Gainst our prince and proud Duryodhan seeks to turn the tide of war! \n
Let us fall upon our foeman and our prince and leader save, \n
Few save INDRA, god of battles, conquers Arjun fierce and brave! \n
What were Matsya's fattened cattle, many thousands though they be, \n
If our monarch sinks in battle like a ship in stormy sea!' \n
Vain were Kripa's words of wisdom! Arjun drove the chariot fair, \n
While his shafts like countless locusts whistled through the ambient air! \n
Kuru soldiers struck with panic neither stood and fought, nor fled, \n
Gazed upon the distant Arjun, gazed upon their comrades dead! \n
Arjun twanged his mighty weapon, blew his far-resounding shell, \n
Strangely spake his monkey-standard, Kuru warriors knew it well! \n
_Sankha's_ voice, _gandiva's_ accents, and the chariot's booming sound, \n
Filled the air like distant thunder, shook the firm and solid ground! \n
Kuru soldiers fled in terror, or they slumbered with the dead, \n
And the rescued lowing cattle, with their tails uplifted, fled! \n
V \n
Warrior's Guerdon \n
Now with joy the king Virata to his royal city came, \n
Saw the rescued herds of cattle, saw Uttara prince of fame, \n
Marked the great and gallant Arjun, helmet-wearing, armour-cased, \n
Knew Yudhishthir and his brothers now as royal princes dressed, \n
And he greeted good Yudhishthir, truth-beloving brave and strong, \n
And to valiant Arjun offered Matsya's princess fair and young! \n
'Pardon, monarch,' answered Arjun, 'but I may not take as bride, \n
Matsya's young and beauteous princess whom I love with father's pride, \n
She hath often met me trusting in the inner palace hall, \n
As a daughter on a father waited on my loving call! \n
I have trained her _kokil_ accents, taught her maiden steps in dance, \n
Watched her skill and varied graces all her native charms enhance! \n
Pure is she in thought and action, spotless as my hero boy, \n
Grant her to my son, O monarch, as his wedded wife and joy! \n
Abhimanyu trained in battle, handsome youth of godlike face, \n
Krishna's sister, fair Subhadra, bore the child of princely grace! \n
Worthy of thy youthful daughter, pure in heart and undefiled, \n
Grant it, sire, my Abhimanyu wed thy young and beauteous child!' \n
Answered Matsya's noble monarch with a glad and grateful heart: \n
'Words like these befit thy virtue, nobly hast thou done thy part! \n
Be it as thou sayest, Arjun; unto Pandu's race allied, \n
Matsya's royal line is honoured, Matsya's king is gratified!' \n
VI \n
The Wedding \n
Good Yudhishthir heard the tidings, and he gave his free assent, \n
Unto distant chiefs and monarchs kindly invitations sent, \n
In the town of Upa-plavya, of fair Matsya's towns the best, \n
Made their home the pious brothers to receive each royal guest. \n
Came unto them Kasi's monarch and his armed troopers came, \n
And the king of fair Panchala with his sons of warlike fame, \n
Came the sons of fair Draupadi early trained in art of war, \n
Other chiefs and sacrifices came from regions near and far. \n
Krishna decked in floral garlands with his elder brother came, \n
And his sister fair Subhadra, Arjun's loved and longing dame, \n
Arjun's son brave Abhimanyu came upon his flowery car, \n
And with elephants and chargers, troopers trained in art of war. \n
Vrishnis from the sea-girt Dwarka, bravo Andhakas known to fame, \n
Bhojas from the mighty Chumbal with the righteous Krishna came, \n
He to gallant sons of Pandu made his presents rich and rare, \n
Gems and gold and costly garments, slaves and damsels passing fair. \n
With its quaint and festive greetings came at last the bridal day, \n
Matsya maids were merry-hearted and the Pandav brothers gay! \n
Conch and cymbal, horn and trumpet spake forth music soft and sweet, \n
In Virata's royal palace, in the peopled mart and street! \n
And they slay the jungle red-deer, and they spread the ample board, \n
And prepare the cooling palm-drink, with the richest viands stored! \n
Mimes and actors please the people, bards recite the ancient song, \n
Glories of heroic houses minstrels by their lays prolong! \n
And deep-bosomed dames of Matsya, jasmine-form and lotus-face, \n
With their pearls and golden garlands joyously the bridal grace! \n
Circled by those royal ladies, though they all are bright and fair, \n
Brightest shines the fair Draupadi with a beauty rich and rare! \n
Stately dames and merry maidens lead the young and soft-eyed bride, \n
As the queens of gods encircle INDRA'S daughter in her pride! \n
Arjun from the Matsya monarch takes the princess passing fair, \n
For his son by fair Subhadra, nursed by Krishna's loving care, \n
With a godlike grace Yudhishthir stands by faithful Arjun's side, \n
As a father takes a daughter, takes the young and beauteous bride, \n
Joins her hands to Abhimanyu's, and with cake and parched rice, \n
On the altar brightly blazing doth the holy sacrifice. \n
Matsya's monarch on the bridegroom rich and costly presents pressed, \n
Elephants he gave two hundred, steeds seven thousand of the best, \n
Poured libations on the altar, on the priests bestowed his gold, \n
Offered to the sons of Pandu rich domain and wealth untold! \n
With a pious hand Yudhishthir, true in heart and pure in mind, \n
Made his gifts, in gold and garments, kine and wealth of every kind, \n
Costly chariots, beds of splendour, robes with thread of gold belaced, \n
Viands rich and sweet confection, drinks the richest and the best, \n
Lands he gave unto the Brahman, bullocks to the labouring swain, \n
Steeds he gave unto the warrior, to the people gifts and grain, \n
And the city of the Matsyas, teeming with a wealth untold, \n
Shone with festive joy and gladness and with flags and cloth of gold! \n<|endoftext|>

America is another Greece. \n
Lit up eggs are stars. \n

How small my mind might seem! \n

The walls are the same, strangely large and unforgiving… \n
The original quest seems difficult to reach… \n
God likes shrunken heroes… \n
And the names! They are all subjective in a second life! \n
America is miracle, the tool of choice. \n
Army is Amarilla- yellow, brilliance or gold, the things to fight with. \n
Country is a word that reminds me I am still counting, which means I am in the second place. \n
God means goad, an Egyptian tool I could not part with. \n
Levers of course I ‘love' if I am Archimedes. \n
And I am Archimedes no more (they say at least) , so others have taken his place- -they have invented televisions, computers, telephones, radios- -or maybe it is heaven for him, because he thought he was done with inventing- -I think that is only because he died- -unless he didn't really. \n
I could be Archimedes if I once was him- -I didn't want to buy him, I could be the nearest thing I know, unless I do not know, or unless I am separated from him. \n
All I need is the spirit of Archimedes… \n
Too much adle-ding my friends! \n

In spite of achievements no. one to him eluded \n
Being monopoly of the Creator and not of the created. \n
Intense was his striving for that coveted position, \n
For more research gave him further inspiration. \n
Wealth he treasured material and spiritual \n
Incomplete yet was though his sole ambition. \n
He wanted to creat life in ways artificial \n
To be victorious in his unique competition. \n
Gigantic will power and sustained hard work \n
Enables him to produce life in laboratory, \n
With process artificial but natural ingredients. \n

Parents'arranged marriages! \n
I don't want to see his \n
Face. Nor does he mine \n
No feelings. Zilch \n
Our kiss, if you call a kiss \n
Is a parchment rubbing our lips \n
Our tongues suffocate \n
I block him. He blocks me \n
In frustration we suffer \n
Castrated, neutered we now both feel \n
And yet we both could not rebel \n
We are utter strangers \n
In a cornered nightmarish union \n
Love by prescription \n

Imprisoned, oppressed \n

Poised above the Gates of Hell, surveying the monstrous pit of eternal damnation… \n
Yet…melancholic, rather than aghast, at the prospect laid before him. \n
Far from the Divine Comedy, he sits alone, in solitary, contemplative thought. \n
To a fresh contemporary eye, appears a modern, secular man..strong in mind and body taut. \n
Yet lonely and still as a statue...butarranged with a sense of movement.. \n
His arm restingon his knee- an exaggerated pose.. but deceiving the mind to believe \n
at any moment… he could rise up and leave \n<|endoftext|>

There is an explosion of green life in the light, \n
This life extrapolates all its emerald green. \n
This life needs its eternity to be as tight \n
And as deep as needed her own son an ice queen. \n
And all the colors of the rainbow may be seen \n
In different amounts to the different shades. \n
Blue irises are placed in a complex world of green. \n
Into the flower bed, these flowers are like spades. \n
They need to reassure, as Pantone may suggest, \n
This world of mystery, which no longer exists. \n
With pale neutral yellow tongs, they're in great request, \n
With neutral yellow thoughts, they please the Queen of White. \n
Alongside darker colors, neutral things sustain \n
The balance of thoughts serving as background to pray. \n
The warm cadmium yellow may accidentally drain \n
The bad spirits and irises keep them away. \n
Van Gogh used such a small amount of indigo, \n
While this indigo conveys truthfulness and trust, \n
But his emerald green was like a piccolo, \n
And through this emerald, his world could readjust. \n
Using the bright head against the rich blue background, \n
Van Gogh sent messages writing with his colors. \n
In an ochre's religious fight, he lost his ear's sound \n
To purify this world, where the thought discolors. \n

Oh Khusrau, the river of love runs in strange directions. \n
One who jumps into it drowns, and one who drowns, gets across. \n

The creaking of the chain of Majnun is the orchestra of the lovers, \n

My life's been rendered miserable in love, may it grow more and more miserable. \n

People think they are alive because they have soul in them, \n
But I am alive because I have love in myself, \n

the affliction brought forth by the beloved) . \n

My beloved speaks Turkish, and Turkish I do not know; \n
How I wish if her tongue would have been in my mouth. \n

You look sleepless, in whose embrace did you pass the night; \n

When Lent and Responsions are ended, \n

When the flower of the chestnut is splendid, \n
When drags are at all of the gates \n

ballade \n
Where smooth the southern waters run \n
By rustling leagues of poplars grey, \n
Beneath a veiled soft southern sun, \n
We wandered out of yesterday, \n
Went maying through that ancient May \n
Whose fallen flowers are fragrant yet, \n
And loitered by the fountain spray \n
With Aucassin and Nicolette. \n
The grass-grown paths are trod of none \n
Where through the woods they went astray. \n
The spider's traceries are spun \n
Across the darkling forest way. \n
There come no knights that ride to slay, \n
No pilgrims through the grasses wet, \n
No shepherd lads that sang their say \n

'Twas here by Nicolette begun \n
Her bower of boughs and grasses gay; \n
'Scaped from the cell of marble dun \n
'Twas here the lover found the fay, \n
Ah, lovers fond! ah, foolish play! \n
How hard we find it to forget \n
Who fain would dwell with them as they, \n
With Aucassin and Nicolette. \n

For youth, for love we both regret. \n

ballade \n
The wary suitor bows with care; \n
he’s mate or meat to a girl this size. \n
But no, she loved his aerial flair \n
so hawks unite with fluttered sighs. \n
They gather sticks, sing lullabies; \n
he hunts, she broods, he kills, she rips \n
and downy hatchlings harmonize \n
a charming woodland partnership. \n
The hummingbird male threads tunes through air \n
with breakneck, spread-tailed, pendulum dives. \n
She’s dazzled by his savoir-faire \n
and swift love ends with swift goodbyes. \n
She gathers spiders’ webs and plies \n
a stretchy nest of soft leaf tips. \n
While wings and heartbeats race, time flies \n
in charming woodland partnerships. \n
Her nest lies near a hawk pair’s lair. \n
When she’s away they’ll supervise \n
and she’s too fast for hawks to snare. \n
The hawks are sure to capitalize. \n
They see her eggs as merchandise \n
enticing jays to risk a trip. \n
Some odd bedfellows socialize \n
in charming woodland partnerships. \n
If prey eludes a hawk’s red eyes \n
or if a hummer’s vigil slips, \n
then hunger pangs can strain the ties \n
of charming woodland partnerships. \n<|endoftext|>
ballade \n
Was I a Samurai renowned, \n
Two-sworded, fierce, immense of bow? \n
A histrion angular and profound? \n
A priest? a porter?--Child, although \n
I have forgotten clean, I know \n
That in the shade of Fujisan, \n
What time the cherry-orchards blow, \n
I loved you once in old Japan. \n
As here you loiter, flowing-gowned \n
And hugely sashed, with pins a-row \n
Your quaint head as with flamelets crowned, \n
Demure, inviting--even so, \n
When merry maids in Miyako \n
To feel the sweet o' the year began, \n
And green gardens to overflow, \n
I loved you once in old Japan. \n
Clear shine the hills; the rice-fields round \n
Two cranes are circling; sleepy and slow, \n
A blue canal the lake's blue bound \n
Breaks at the bamboo bridge; and lo! \n
Touched with the sundown's spirit and glow, \n
I see you turn, with flirted fan, \n
Against the plum-tree's bloomy snow . . . \n
I loved you once in old Japan! \n

But that I was a lucky man \n

All secret shadows and mystic lights, \n
Late lovers murmur and linger and gaze - \n

Wild skylarks hover, the gorses blaze, \n

By Mystic's banks I held my dream. \n
(I held my fishing rod as well,) \n
The vision was of dace and bream, \n
A fruitless vision, sooth to tell. \n
But round about the sylvan dell \n
Were other sweet Arcadian shrines, \n
Gone now, is all the rural spell, \n
Arcadia has trolley lines. \n
Oh, once loved, sluggish, darkling stream, \n
For me no more, thy waters swell, \n
Thy music now the engines' scream, \n
Thy fragrance now the factory's smell; \n
Too near for me the clanging bell; \n
A false light in the water shines \n
While Solitude lists to her knell,-- \n
Arcadia has trolley lines. \n
Thy wooded lanes with shade and gleam \n
Where bloomed the fragrant asphodel, \n
Now bleak commercially teem \n
With signs 'To Let,' 'To Buy,' 'To Sell.' \n
And Commerce holds them fierce and fell; \n
With vulgar sport she now combines \n
Sweet Nature's piping voice to quell. \n

ballade \n
The stag was very proud of his swiftness, \n
Of running ten miles in one breath, \n
And the wild boar was proud to be fierce, \n
And the sheep praised her woolly fleece, \n
And the horse its beauty, and the buck was proud \n
Of crossing the plain at a bound, \n
And the one proud of strength was the bull, \n
The ermine in having a furry skin; \n
And to them all he said from his shell: \n
'The snail will get to Easter just as soon. \n
What I see first are lions, leopards, bears, \n
Running the countryside, wolves and tigers \n
Under pursuit by greyhound and mastiff \n
And the shouts of men, so hated that if \n
They're caught each person will attack, \n
Because of the destruction of the flock; \n
They're thieves, treacherous and wicked, \n
And merciless, and for that detested. \n
Are they strong and fast? Good at a run? \n
The snail will get to Easter just as soon. \n
Many see him and the path he's on, \n
Enclosed in the shell he carries along, \n
They don't do him harm, they let him be, \n
And so he goes from week to week, \n
As many go in their own poor realm \n
Who live good lives in their simple gown, \n
And if the world gives them little at all, \n
They still go on with its good will. \n
And cow and calf have the meadow's run, \n
And the snail will get to Easter just as soon. \n
Prince, among the strong, the rich, the great \n
There's a lesson they rarely think about; \n
Their haste can't bring the future on: \n
The snail will get to Easter just as soon. \n<|endoftext|>

The sound says love is not a crush; \n
As one we moved from plain to dote. \n
The love became more than a blush. \n
You are my boo, that is my vote. \n
My words are true, no need to note. \n
I love you, Anne; with my very all! \n
You’ll know by actions that cause rote; \n
A love more than love could recall. \n

It sings a song that please by mote. \n
His feathers are a stunning plush, \n
His owners are the wealthy Vacote, \n
They live by bay and have a boat. \n
Let’s dance on this oceanic ball, \n
I know it’s love that keeps afloat. \n
A love more than love could recall. \n
Let love speak- every qualm stay hushed. \n
The birds' song tells the love I wrote. \n
The song says my heart goes to mush, \n
I love you so much that I do gloat; \n
Each day our love I do promote! \n
The love you give me does enthrall.. \n
My days to you I do devote; \n
A love more than love could recall. \n
Our hills are big and very lush, \n
They’re full of plums and then a cote, \n
That keeps safe mistletoe's thrush \n
A bird that sings the lovers' note; \n
There even lies a pretty goat! \n
To give, I have the wherewithal, \n
On my word, I do not misquote, \n
A love more than love could recall. \n
Look at the waves, how they do gush \n
And beat on the stockades of the boat, \n
With one weak spot the boat could crush \n
To portions that are very mote. \n
But it does not; we are the boat! \n
For never will we sink and fall! \n
These are the words we need to note. \n
A love more than love could recall. \n

Let us be timed, let us not rush. \n
I wish we fly and never float: \n
forever our time will be flush; \n
Our love forever will be rote, \n
As we pilot our joyous boat. \n
Your face hangs on my every wall. \n
In love, you too have my true vote; \n
A love more than love could recall. \n
Upon the sea, upon this boat, \n

Our love, both man and God will note; \n

1.	How hard I cross my fingers when I'm headed home. Every time. It's like a bad habit, the hoping, the wishing. I need to stop wishing. \n
2.	That your hair is always messy. Don't worry, I like it that way. It makes you look like an electric shock, alive, chaotic. It spells out exactly how much of your life you've lived, not just existed. \n
3.	The awkward greetings I give you when we pass, trying to pierce through a perfect day, but they always fall flat or quiet. \n
4.	You mean all your compliments, but the most you do is mean them. They are not a gift to you, or reaching out in the dark. They are words. \n
5.	But you always know just what to say to me. \n
6.	I overthink your words. \n
7.	I overthink my words. \n
8.	I overthink everything. \n
9.	How you almost fall backwards out of chairs every time you laugh. Without fail. It's like you're falling for something other than me. \n
10.	When I walk into a room, I look for an empty seat next to you just so I can trick myself into thinking you're inching closer to me. It's always my chair moving. \n
11.	The way the minutes sprint by in the early morning, countless nights where at 4am you'll say you're not tired and an hour later I have to drag you out so you don't do anything you'll regret. You're falling asleep the whole time but they're still the best nights I've had in a while. \n
12.	Your favorite song. Correction: your favorite songs. Every time one of them comes on and I can feel your eyes light up before I even look at you, I add it to a list of things to listen to harder. I want to know them better than I know you. \n
13.	That no matter how far away you are I can still feel you moving like chains or a marionette string. Maybe you have dark magic. I don't really care. I love black holes. \n
14.	I need to end this list before I add you to it, because I don't know you by heart I don't know you by heart I want to know you by heart by hands by head by everything \n
15.	You, someday. \n
16.	How hard I cross my fingers when I'm headed to you. Every time. It's like a bad habit, the hoping, the wishing. I need to stop wishing. \n
17.	I will never stop wishing. \n<|endoftext|>

Fast breaks. Lay ups. With Mercury's \n
Insignia on our sneakers, \n
We outmaneuvered to footwork \n
Of bad angels. Nothing but a hot \n
Swish of strings like silk \n
Ten feet out. In the roundhouse \n
Labyrinth our bodies \n
Created, we could almost \n
Last forever, poised in midair \n
Like storybook sea monsters. \n
A high note hung there \n
A long second. Off \n
The rim. We'd corkscrew \n
Up & dunk balls that exploded \n
The skullcap of hope & good \n
Intention. Lanky, all hands \n
& feet...sprung rhythm. \n
We were metaphysical when girls \n
Cheered on the sidelines. \n
Tangled up in a falling, \n
Muscles were a bright motor \n
Double-flashing to the metal hoop \n
Nailed to our oak. \n
When Sonny Boy's mama died \n
He played nonstop all day, so hard \n
Our backboard splintered. \n
Glistening with sweat, \n
We rolled the ball off \n
Our fingertips. Trouble \n
Was there slapping a blackjack \n
Against an open palm. \n
Dribble, drive to the inside, \n
& glide like a sparrow hawk. \n
Lay ups. Fast breaks. \n
We had moves we didn't know \n
We had. Our bodies spun \n
On swivels of bone & faith, \n
Through a lyric slipknot \n
Of joy, & we knew we were \n
Beautiful & dangerous. \n<|endoftext|>

I fell from a crater and stepped off \n
It was burning in the sky like a heaved Molotoff \n
Crashed onto the earths crust \n
I tried to move my muscles but it was like moving a hinge with rust \n
I stood naked looking up to the moon which was full that day \n
Its eye looked like slow tooth decay \n
I smelled the burning of the forests \n
One of my biggest tests \n
Sent forth to preach love and happiness \n
This delirium has become my reality \n
Here to fulfill the written prophecy \n
Written by the hand of a Nordic man \n
Written by pictures with swirls of the hand \n
Many colors depicted the coming of the soldiers of peace \n
Walking below the moon in a torn white yarn fleece \n
Thoughts being sent out to the messengers \n
From the almighty in the heavens to his passengers \n
That come to save this world of the sun \n
Oh yes I am one \n
I am part of the eternal sun \n
Sent to shine happiness to all \n
Not to institutionalize us like Paul \n
But for us to be sent free to do God's work on our own \n
After all we are materials made of flesh and bone \n
One day we will disintegrate \n
And be fed to earth the great \n
We are meant to become one with it \n
So why do we try to fight it \n
We just become nihilistic \n
Read the statistic \n
My light shines more than the intercontinental ballistic \n
Feel this warmth as it transitions into the light \n
I'm fighting the war we all should fight \n
The separation of all the races \n
We will see the Lord early just because of the color of our faces \n
Religions that institutionalize us to gain more power \n
They all have our ears so that they can devour \n
What makes us different between all animals \n
We have the ability to love but still we are cannibals \n
Made up of syllables \n
That define us like solutions on the timetables \n
Reach in and foster your true ability to shed light \n
I'm through with shedding tears from fright \n
Some days we're orange and some days we are red \n
I want to shed as much light as I can before I'm dead \n<|endoftext|>

I could be the perfect man for you \n

I could be all races and cultures combined in one man \n
and give you all the love that you can stand \n
If you're looking fort a man \n
who will treat you like a queen \n
I'd give you a tour of seven continents \n
and every island in between \n
although it may seem like a dream \n
with a far-fetched reality \n

Imagining U and I forever \n
makes two the perfect catch \n

any love you've experienced from any other man \n
you and I may have been two worlds apart \n

December 28, 2019 \n
After a snooze \n
The stranger began to sneeze \n
It made a sudden burst out \n
Of sharp sound, \n
Though the sound broke the longer silence of the room \n
It caused asking him \n
A lot of questions \n
Of harsh and fun, \n
James, \n
Let's have a game \n

slam \n
It's the kiss of death, no tongue \n
she took my breath away, like collapsed lungs \n
She was Bonnie, I was Clyde, I took it all in stride \n
and went along for the ride \n
she's a ride or die, so no seat belts \n
we did want we wanted or what the heart felt… \n
was wrong, it's the same song playing over again on repeat \n
We were a power couple no others could compete \n
She's too busy for friends and I'm all the family needs \n
chasing the chasing the paper down, while running the streets \n
I loved her to death, but she is the darkness in my soul \n
I was getting reckless at the wheel, and my life out of control \n
But, I could never let her go, because she was all that had left \n
so I took an exit off the highway, stage left \n
people would talk to me about her, but it was talking to the deaf \n
because I was intoxicated with her, down to my last breath \n
her love was my drug and so I was her addict \n
the whole world was a blur, so it was time to panic \n
back on the highway, but she's in the driver's seat \n
she didn't even have a permit, but I couldn't see the street \n
head spinning like ring-around-the-rosy to a beat \n
Suddenly we saw red and blue lights in the rear-view \n
She was like 'we not going to jail, just be cool' \n
she pulled the ride, to the side, slowed down until she parked it \n
a man was approaching from behind, so she decided to spark it \n
she put her foot on the gas and mashed it, \n
the limiter went down fast as if she wanted to pass it \n
the road was really wet, but we took flight like a leer jet \n
on your mark... get set... \n
I felt like I wouldn't make it out alive \n
like playing Russian roulette with a loaded gun… suicide \n
I told her to stop but she said this our fate, \n
so then I mashed her foot down and then hit the emergency brake, \n
The car sorta swerved around, then stopped into place \n
I was sitting there feeling like cooked food on a hot plate \n
You only got one life to live and for me this is very scary \n
Surrounded on all sides, but we're not military \n
I can feel the heat as I approached the furnace \n
she's look at her heater thinking, 'I should burn this' \n
my life flashed before me in 3d \n
I wasn't ready to die, but I wanted her with me \n
She looked at me and said 'I'll see you in hell, baby' \n
I was like oh, hell no! ! ! no ifs, ands, or maybes \n
I'll meet you at heaven's gate, save you a seat at the table \n
She said but there's a spot in hell for us already and heaven can't be bought \n
she said that's not for people like us, cut from the same cloth \n
you think and I do... you are the paper, I'm the glue \n
we stick together, me and you \n
She said if you not coming with me by choice, then I'm taking you force \n
we deeper than any marriage, we won't end in divorce \n
she pointed the gun at my head and she then said \n
do remember last December you wrote me that letter \n
it was a love jones, it said that we'd be together forever, \n
for worse or for better, it's now or never… \n
you know how we ride, so now let's die together \n
Gun to my head, I guess it could be said, I'm sweating bullets \n
I'm looking at the trigger, wondering if she would pull it \n
I tried not to cry, as she said goodbye \n
remembering the 'good times' or bad times from the naked eye \n
I held my head up to the sky and said 'Oh my… \n
God forgive me', then I awoke \n<|endoftext|>
slam \n
You let it all rest on a paper thin promise \n
But tonight you'll go out with hope, a reported sighting of elusive hope \n
The same type of hope that leads people to believe in that which they cannot see and cannot touch and cannot sense in any other way \n
My friends had to carry you out \n
An arm over each victorious shoulder \n
Alive with the dual camaraderie of violence and tribal connection \n
And in the pit you felt alive \n
Egged on by posers standing on the outside \n
In those days, nobody got their fun from deliberate harm \n
Six poor youths sharing an all you can eat salad bar \n
Sweaty, drunk, no bad impressions of the world have formed in their heads \n
None of them deserve lives that will be diametrically opposed to tonight \n
If we had an example who was neither a man nor a woman \n
Jean wore a half-moon shirt and was instantly emulated \n
This place is sometimes used as a gym during the day and Jean is the only one visible from the bleachers \n
Relate to a scene whose worth was endangered from conception \n
Will one day disappear and be remembered in documentaries \n
Jean, did you not exist in the cold, hard light of serious self-reliance? \n<|endoftext|>

slam \n
By the foot of the bed, \n
from memory, I recite \n
D'Invilliers' quatrain. \n
“Then wear the gold hat” \n
leaves you flat \n
and you are unmoved. \n
“If you can bounce high” \n
brings a smile to your lips \n
and you are amused. \n
“Till she cry, Lover” \n
hits closer to home \n
and you sigh. \n
In the window the trees \n
are yellow and brown. \n
The harbour is “a blue cove \n
full of fish processing \n
and ships that never go \n
anywhere.” With Pound, \n
the one that begins \n
“Come, let us pity...” \n
all I get is a yawn and \n
a look of impatience. \n
“The rich have butlers...” \n
sounds so stale, so sixties. \n
“Dawn enters with little feet...” \n
arouses a distant memory \n
but no feeling and the fine \n
effect of that final line \n
with its image of waking \n
together and sharing \n
a “clear coolness” \n
barely registers. \n
With “Na Audiart” things \n
begin quickly to come undone. \n
Image crowds image \n
with no clear demarcation. \n
“Thy bodice laces” \n
rubs against the grain. \n
“Thy girdle's scope” \n
weighs heavily in the balance. \n
Nor do you find aught to praise \n
in “ivy fingers clutching...” \n
The objection you'd raise \n
is a simple one but fine: \n
you wish me well not ill \n
but given one more line \n
like “being bent and wrinkled” \n
and you will begin to wonder. \n
“In an Evil Time” sparks \n
a real anger, something sharp, \n
something hitherto unseen. \n
You can't see how “This is \n
the night, that was bound to come” \n
relates to us, to our love. \n
We are here, we are now, \n
We have the sun, the sea, \n
the forest ablaze with colour, \n
sand dunes where the piping \n
plover nests in the tall grass, \n
in the tangles of beach peas. \n
The bread tastes of thyme \n
and sage, the cheese \n
is a Camembert, the wine \n
a Côte de Rhone, \n
and I think it's only fair \n
we have another go at Hesse, \n
but something light this time, \n
like “The First Flowers.” \n
Perhaps it's the fragrant wine \n
Or the fine, moist bread \n
Or the luscious words \n
But for some reason you find \n
“These days so many yellow flowers \n
have opened their eyes into gold” \n
not just nice, but right \n
in tone and thrust. \n
On the sun-soaked sill \n
lies the last book \n
in my bag of surprises, \n
a beat-up softcover, \n
Williams's Immortal Poems. \n
“O Mistress mine, where \n
are you roaming? ” I read \n
at random, and your eyes \n
sparkle with delight. \n
“O, stay and hear...” \n
breeds more of the same. \n
But when I come upon \n
“Your true love's coming...” \n
you laugh out loud because, \n
according to your calculation, \n
that's a slight exaggeration. \n
“Once you did and once you \n
didn't, ” you're quick to remind me. \n
But the look in your eyes \n
tells me that you mean no \n
harm, and in my heart I rejoice \n
in that part of you that loves me, \n
as well as that part that loves \n
to tease me because they're both \n
you and you are one and the same. \n
In the window the trees \n
are gray and black. \n
Below the window \n
the harbour is the back \n
of a black whale \n
that connects \n
this shore \n
to the far shore. \n
And when you \n
draw me down \n
into a kiss \n
the words \n
are mine \n
and mine alone, \n
“I live for this \n
and this alone.” \n<|endoftext|>

The raindrops on the rooftop pitter patter \n
And the wind the leaves on the verandah scatter \n
On this wild and wet January sunday in the Summer \n
The type of day the Aussies call a 'bummer' \n
Today lovers not out walking hand in hand together \n
One might say this is doggerel writing weather \n
For to scribble useless rhymes in moments of leisure \n
Not for wealth or fame but for one's own pleasure. \n
Just like our image in the mirror is reflected \n
It has been said by weather our mood is affected \n

Yesterday in the sunshine they walked hand in hand together \n

doggerel \n
Is it not doggerel, this verse of mine? \n
That is, it is not meant to be just rhyme \n
That keeps it going, without shape or sense. \n
I try not to fill up, at the expense \n
Of deeper meaning, lines with useless words \n
That pad the poem; it would be absurd \n
To think that I, because it just won't fit, \n
Should sacrifice my principles a bit. \n
No, though I try to make it sing and scan, \n
It's not that I devise a perfect plan \n
That makes the structure more important, say, \n
Than what I want to write. Another way \n
Of thinking might reveal that I, constrained \n
By metre, find that nothing's to be gained \n
From simply penning nonsense. What's the point \n
Of wasting precious moments if, disjoint, \n
The words do not converge in unity \n
To put my case. I'm fighting to be free \n
To get my message out and state my aim: \n
I do not simply scribble. Though it's plain \n
This poetry's old-fashioned, I don't state \n
Pentameter's anachronistic; fate \n
Seems to decree that sometimes words come out \n
In rhyming couplets and I have no doubt \n
That I'll continue writing in this form \n
Which once was thought by all to be the norm \n
But now they seek contemporary style. \n
Though, in my case, it will be quite a while \n
Until I ditch this stilted stuff. Till then \n
It will sound like doggerel I pen. \n<|endoftext|>

(doggerel)Driving With Dotty (part two) \n
Why does that moron drive slower than Dotty \n
And if you drive faster you're potty \n
He's unhappy the way that our Dotty drives \n
He gets off of the walk and survives \n
Dotty's reformed. She is driving with caution \n
"Someone was pulled over. Good land o goshen." \n
When parking our Dotty lacks poise \n
There is always a bothersome noise \n<|endoftext|>
doggerel \n
Those who define what is doggerel from poetry in their own ways seem small \n
To them even a well written rhyme poem is not poetry at all \n
Are their souls without music is poetry not song \n
Or is my thinking outdated have I got it wrong? \n
What to them is or is not poetry is their business not mine \n
They have their opinions and that suits me fine \n
As for me one who can't separate blank verse from prose \n
Must be unenlightened one would have to suppose. \n
Yet I do not apologize for my liking of rhyme \n
And for my favourite poets I must go back in time \n
And perhaps I do seem old fashioned in my antiquated way \n
When I say I do not have a liking of the poems of the major poets of today. \n
Of one deceptive modernist terminology I have taken note \n
There is no such a thing as a doggerel poet \n
The point of music in rhyme they somehow seem to miss \n
But even amongst some of the highly educated ignorance can be bliss. \n<|endoftext|>
decastich \n
I have often wondered about grasping men, \n
I have wondered about the way that the world goes \n
under the people that were elected to lead the way \n
and about their desire for fortune and fame, \n
about Presidents that do not waver to tell a lie, \n
about leaders that sent soldiers off to war \n
and wondered if they do consider the consequences \n
or is there something evil that besets each great good man \n
a corruption that power does always bring? \n<|endoftext|>
pastoral \n
First in these fields I try the sylvan strains, \n
Nor blush to sport on Windsor's blissful plains: \n
Fair Thames, flow gently from thy sacred spring, \n
While on thy banks Sicilian Muses sing; \n
Let vernal airs tho' trembling osiers play, \n
And Albion's cliffs resound the rural lay. \n
You, that too wise for pride, too good for pow'r, \n
Enjoy the glory to be great no more, \n
And carrying with you all the world can boast, \n
To all the world illustriously are lost! \n
O let my Muse her slender reed inspire, \n
Till in your native shades you tune the lyre: \n
So when the Nightingale to rest removes, \n
The Thrush may chant to the forsaken groves, \n
But, charm'd to silence, listens while she sings, \n
And all th' aerial audience clap their wings. \n
Soon as the flocks shook off the nightly dews, \n
Two Swains, whom Love kept wakeful, and the Muse \n
Pour'd o'er the whitening vale their fleecy care, \n
Fresh as the morn, and as the season fair: \n
The dawn now blushing on the mountain's side, \n
Thus Daphnis spoke, and Strephon thus reply'd. \n
Daphnis. \n
Hear how the birds, on ev'ry bloomy spray, \n
With joyous musick wake the dawning day! \n
Why sit we mute when early linnets sing, \n
When warbling Philomel salutes the spring? \n
Why sit we sad when Phosphor shines so clear, \n
And lavish nature paints the purple Year? \n
Strephon. \n
Sing, then, and Damon shall attend the strain, \n
While yon' slow oxen turn the furrow'd Plain. \n
Here the bright crocus and blue vi'let glow; \n
Here western winds on breathing roses blow. \n
I'll stake yon' lamb, that near the fountain plays, \n
And from the brink his dancing shade surveys. \n
Daphnis. \n
And I this bowl, where wanton Ivy twines, \n
And swelling clusters bend the curling vines: \n
Four figures rising from the work appear, \n
The various seasons of the rolling year; \n
And what is that, which binds the radiant sky, \n
Where twelve fair Signs in beauteous order lie? \n
Damon. \n
Then sing by turns, by turns the Muses sing, \n
Now hawthorns blossom, now the daisies spring, \n
Now leaves the trees, and flow'rs adorn the ground, \n
Begin, the vales shall ev'ry note rebound. \n
Inspire me, Phoebus, in my Delia's praise \n
With Waller's strains, or Granville's moving lays! \n
A milk-white bull shall at your altars stand, \n
That threats a fight, and spurns the rising sand. \n
Daphnis. \n
O Love! for Sylvia let me gain the prize, \n
And make my tongue victorious as her eyes; \n
No lambs or sheep for victims I'll impart, \n
Thy victim, Love, shall be the shepherd's heart. \n
Strephon. \n
Me gentle Delia beckons from the plain, \n
Then hid in shades, eludes her eager swain; \n
But feigns a laugh, to see me search around, \n
And by that laugh the willing fair is found. \n
Daphnis. \n
The sprightly Sylvia trips along the green, \n
She runs, but hopes she does not run unseen; \n
While a kind glance at her pursuer flies, \n
How much at variance are her feet and eyes! \n
Strephon. \n
O'er golden sands let rich Pactolus flow, \n
And trees weep amber on the banks of Po; \n
Blest Thames's shores the brightest beauties yield, \n
Feed here my lambs, I'll seek no distant field. \n
Daphnis. \n
Celestial Venus haunts Idalia's groves; \n
Diana Cynthus, Ceres Hybla loves; \n
If Windsor-shades delight the matchless maid, \n
Cynthus and Hybla yield to Windsor-shade. \n
Strephon. \n
All nature mourns, the Skies relent in show'rs, \n
Hush'd are the birds, and clos'd the drooping flow'rs; \n
If Delia smile, the flow'rs begin to spring, \n
The skies to brighten, and the birds to sing. \n
Daphnis. \n
All nature laughs, the groves are fresh and fair, \n
The Sun's mild lustre warms the vital air; \n
If Sylvia smiles, new glories gild the shore, \n
And vanquish'd nature seems to charm no more. \n
Strephon. \n
In spring the fields, in autumn hills I love, \n
At morn the plains, at noon the shady grove, \n
But Delia always; absent from her sight, \n
Nor plains at morn, nor groves at noon delight. \n
Daphnis. \n
Sylvia's like autumn ripe, yet mild as May, \n
More bright than noon, yet fresh as early day; \n
Ev'n spring displeases, when she shines not here; \n
But blest with her, 'tis spring throughout the year. \n
Strephon. \n
Say, Daphnis, say, in what glad soil appears, \n
A wond'rous Tree that sacred Monarchs bears: \n
Tell me but this, and I'll disclaim the prize, \n
And give the conquest to thy Sylvia's eyes. \n
Daphnis. \n
Nay tell me first, in what more happy fields \n
The Thistle springs, to which the Lily yields: \n
And then a nobler prize I will resign; \n
For Sylvia, charming Sylvia, shall be thine. \n
Damon. \n
Cease to contend, for, Daphnis, I decree, \n
The bowl to Strephon, and the lamb to thee: \n
Blest Swains, whose Nymphs in ev'ry grace excel; \n
Blest Nymphs, whose Swains those graces sing so well! \n
Now rise, and haste to yonder woodbine bow'rs, \n
A soft retreat from sudden vernal show'rs, \n
The turf with rural dainties shall be crown'd, \n
While op'ning blooms diffuse their sweets around. \n
For see! the gath'ring flocks to shelter tend, \n
And from the Pleiads fruitful show'rs descend. \n<|endoftext|>
pastoral \n
Maybe there could have been \n
another life that led us here, \n
where we ended up: \n
mapless, dehydrated, telling stories \n
about cruelty to insects, about \n
setting little fires—tiny gods \n
with magnifying glasses. We could \n
have moved into another house, \n
maybe the one next door \n
with the rats, or the other side \n
with the dandelion problem. \n
French doors instead of sliding glass. \n
We got the ants, the picture window. \n
Plan A, berber, gazebo. Afternoons \n
where every moment slid down \n
silently into the moment before: \n
piling up like cigarette ends, \n
merit badges, a single summer \n
of sawdust and parch. Maybe another \n
life like that, one where it wouldn't matter \n
how many fires, how long we ran the taps. \n<|endoftext|>

DERMOT, SHEELAH \n
A Nymph and swain, Sheelah and Dermot hight; \n
Who wont to weed the court of Gosford knight; \n
While each with stubbed knife removed the roots, \n
That raised between the stones their daily shoots; \n
As at their work they sate in counterview, \n
With mutual beauty smit, their passion grew. \n
Sing, heavenly Muse, in sweetly flowing strain, \n
The soft endearments of the nymph and swain. \n
DERMOT \n
My love to Sheelah is more firmly fixt, \n
Than strongest weeds that grow those stones betwixt; \n
My spud these nettles from the stones can part; \n
No knife so keen to weed thee from my heart. \n
SHEELAH \n
My love for gentle Dermot faster grows, \n
Than yon tall dock that rises to thy nose. \n
Cut down the dock, 'twill sprout again; but, O! \n
Love rooted out, again will never grow. \n
DERMOT \n
No more that brier thy tender leg shall rake: \n
(I spare the thistles for Sir Arthur's sake) \n
Sharp are the stones; take thou this rushy mat; \n
The hardest bum will bruise with sitting squat. \n
SHEELAH \n
Thy breeches, torn behind, stand gaping wide; \n
This petticoat shall save thy dear backside; \n
Nor need I blush; although you feel it wet, \n
Dermot, I vow, 'tis nothing else but sweat. \n
DERMOT \n
At an old stubborn root I chanced to tug, \n
When the Dean threw me this tobacco-plug; \n
A longer ha'p'orth never did I see; \n
This, dearest Sheelah, thou shall share with me. \n
SHEELAH \n
In at the pantry door, this morn I slipt, \n
And from the shelf a charming crust I whipt: \n
Dennis was out, and I got hither safe; \n
And thou, my dear, shall have the bigger half. \n
DERMOT \n
When you saw Tady at long bullets play, \n
You sate and loused him all a sunshine day: \n
How could you, Sheelah, listen to his tales, \n
Or crack such lice as his between your nails? \n
SHEELAH \n
When you with Oonah stood behind a ditch, \n
I peep'd, and saw you kiss the dirty bitch; \n
Dermot, how could you touch these nasty sluts? \n
I almost wish'd this spud were in your guts. \n
DERMOT \n
If Oonah once I kiss'd, forbear to chide; \n
Her aunt's my gossip by my father's side: \n
But, if I ever touch her lips again, \n
May I be doom'd for life to weed in rain! \n
SHEELAH \n
Dermot, I swear, though Tady's locks could hold \n
Ten thousand lice, and every louse was gold; \n
Him on my lap you never more shall see; \n
Or may I lose my weeding knife—and thee! \n
DERMOT \n
O, could I earn for thee, my lovely lass, \n
A pair of brogues to bear thee dry to mass! \n
But see, where Norah with the sowins comes— \n
Then let us rise, and rest our weary bums. \n<|endoftext|>

Melibæus, Alcippe, Asteria, Licida, Alcimedon, and Amira. \n
Melibæus. Welcome fair Nymphs, most welcome to this shade, \n
Distemp'ring Heats do now the Plains invade: \n
But you may sit, from Sun securely here, \n
If you an old mans company not fear. \n
Alcippe. Most Reverend Swaine, far from us ever be \n
The imputation of such Vanity. \n
From Hill to Holt w'ave thee unweary'd sought, \n
And bless the Chance that us hath hither brought. \n
Asteria. Fam'd Melibæus for thy Virtuous Lays, \n
If thou dost not disdain our Female Praise, \n
We come to sue thou would'st to us recite \n
One of thy Songs, which gives such high delight \n
To ev'ry Eare, wherein thou dost dispense \n
Sage Precepts cloath'd in flowing Eloquence. \n
Licida. Fresh Garlands we will make for thee each morne, \n
Thy reverend Head to shade, and to adorne; \n
To cooling Springs thy fainting Flock we'll guide, \n
All thou command'st, to do shall be our Pride. \n
Meli. Cease, gentle Nymphs, the Willing to entreat, \n
To have your Wish, each needs but take a Seat. \n
With joy I shall my ancient Art revive, \n
With which, when Young, I did for Glory strive. \n
Nor for my Verse will I accept a Hire, \n
Your bare Attentions all I shall require. \n
Alci. Lo, from the Plain I see draw near a Pair \n
That I could wish in our Converse might share. \n
Amira 'tis and young Alcimedon. \n
Lici. Serious Discourse industriously they shun. \n
Alci. \n
It being yet their luck to come this way, \n
The Fond Ones to our Lecture we'll betray: \n
And though they only sought a private shade, \n
Perhaps they may depart more Vertuous made. \n
I will accost them. Gentle Nymph and Swaine, \n
Good Melibæus us doth entertain \n
With Lays Divine: if you'll his Hearers be, \n
Take streight your Seats without Apology. \n
Alci. Paying short thanks, at fair Amiras feet, \n
I'le lay me down: let her choose where 'tis meet. \n
Al. Shepherd, behold, we all attentive sit. \n
Meli. \n
What shall I sing? what shall my Muse reherse? \n
Love is a Theme well sutes a Past'ral Verse, \n
That gen'ral Error, Universal Ill, \n
That Darling of our Weakness and our Will; \n
By which though many fall, few hold it shame; \n
Smile at the Fault, which they would seem to blame. \n
What wonder then, if those with Mischief play, \n
It to destruction them doth oft betray? \n
But by experience it is daily found, \n
That Love the softer Sex does sorest wound; \n
In Mind, as well as Body, far more weak \n
Than Men: therefore to them my Song shall speak, \n
Advising well, however it succeed: \n
But unto All I say, Of Love take heed. \n
So hazardous, because so hard to know \n
On whom they are we do our Hearts bestow; \n
How they will use them, or with what regard \n
Our Faith and high Esteem they will reward: \n
For few are found, that truly acted be \n
By Principles of Generosity. \n
That when they know a Virgins Heart they've gain'd, \n
(And though by many Vows and Arts obtain'd) \n
Will think themselves oblig'd their Faith to hold \n
Tempted by Friends, by Interest, or by Gold. \n
Expect it not most, Love their Pastime make, \n
Lightly they Like, and lightly they forsake; \n
Their Roving Humour wants but a pretence \n
With Oaths and what's most Sacred to dispence. \n
When unto such a Maid has given her Heart, \n
And said, Alone my Happiness thou art, \n
In thee and in thy Truth I place my Rest. \n
Her sad Surprize how can it be exprest, \n
When all on which she built her Joy she finds, \n
Vanish, like Clouds, disperst before the Winds; \n
Her self, who th' adored Idol wont to be, \n
A poor despis'd Idolater to see? \n
Regardless Tears she may profusely spend, \n
Unpitty'd sighs her tender Breast may rend: \n
But the false Image she will ne're erace, \n
Though far unworthy still to hold its place: \n
So hard it is, even Wiser grown, to take \n
Th' Impression out, which Fancy once did make. \n
Believe me Nymphs, believe my hoary hairs, \n
Truth and Experience waits on many years. \n
Before the Eldest of you Light beheld, \n
A Nymph we had, in Beauty all excell'd, \n
Rodanthe call'd, in whom each Grace did shine, \n
Could make a Mortal Maid appear Divine. \n
And none could say, where most her Charms did lye, \n
In her inchanting Tongue, or conquering Eye. \n
Her Vertue yet her Beauties so out-shon, \n
As Beauty did the Garments she put on! \n
Among the Swains, which here their Flocks then fed, \n
Alcander with the highest held his head; \n
The most Accomplish't was esteem'd to be, \n
Of comely Forme, well-grac't Activity; \n
The Muses too, like him, did none inspire, \n
None so did stop the Pipe, or touch the Lyre; \n
Sweet was his Voice, and Eloquent his Tongue; \n
Alike admired when he Spoke, or Sung! \n
But these so much Excelling parts the Swain, \n
With Imperfections no less Great, did stain: \n
For proud he was, of an Ungovern'd Will, \n
With Love Familiar, but a Stranger still \n
To Faith and Constancy; and did his Heart, \n
Retaining none, expose to ev'ry Dart. \n
Hapless Rodanthe, the Fond Rover, caught, \n
To whom, for Love, with usual Arts he sought; \n
Which she, ah too unwary, did bestow: \n
'Cause True her self, believ'd that he was so. \n
But he, alas, more wav'ring than the Wind, \n
Streight broke the Chain, she thought so fast did bind; \n
For he no sooner saw her Heart was gain'd, \n
But he as soon the Victory disdain'd; \n
Mad Love else-where, as if 'twere like Renown, \n
Hearts to subdue, as to take in a Town: \n
But in the One as Manhood does prevail, \n
Both Truth and Manhood in the other fail. \n
And now the Nymph (of late so gay and bright, \n
The Glory of the Plains and the Delight, \n
Who still in Wit and Mirth all Pastimes led) \n
Hung like a wither'd Flow'r her drooping Head. \n
I need not tell the Grief Rodanthe found, \n
How all that should asswage, enrag'd her Wound; \n
Her Form, her Fame, her Vertue, Riches, Wit, \n
Like Deaths sad Weights upon her Soul did sit: \n
Or else like Furies stood before her Face, \n
Still urging and Upbraiding her Disgrace, \n
In that the World could yield her no Content, \n
But what alone the False Alcander sent. \n
'Twas said, through just Disdain, at last she broke \n
The Disingenious and Unworthy Yoke: \n
But this I know, her Passion held long time, \n
Constancy, though Unhappy, is no Crime. \n
Remember when you Love, from that same hour \n
Your Peace you put into your Lovers Power: \n
From that same hour from him you Laws receive, \n
And as he shall ordain, you Joy, or Grieve, \n
Hope, Fear, Laugh, Weep; Reason aloof does stand, \n
Disabl'd both to Act, and to Command. \n
Oh Cruel Fetters! rather wish to feel, \n
On your soft Limbs, the Gauling Weight of Steel; \n
Rather to bloudy Wounds oppose your Breast \n
No Ill, by which the Body can be prest; \n
You will so sensible a Torment find, \n
As Shackles on your captivated Mind. \n
The Mind from Heaven its high Descent did draw, \n
And brooks uneasily any other Law, \n
Than what from Reason dictated shall be, \n
Reason, a kind of In-mate Deity. \n
Which only can adapt to ev'ry Soul \n
A Yoke so fit and light, that the Controle \n
All Liberty excels; so sweet a Sway, \n
The same 'tis to be Happy, and Obey; \n
Commands so Wise and with Rewards so drest \n
That the according Soul replys, I'm Blest. \n
This teaches rightly how to Love and Hate, \n
To fear and hope by Measure and just Weight; \n
What Tears in Grief ought from our Eyes to flow, \n
What Transport in Felicity to show; \n
In ev'ry Passion how to steer the Will, \n
Tho rude the Shock, to keep it steady still. \n
Oh happy Mind! what words, can speak thy Bliss, \n
When in a Harmony thou mov'st like this? \n
Your Hearts fair Virgins keep smooth as your Brow, \n
Not the least Am'rous Passion there allow; \n
Hold not a Parly with what may betray \n
Your inward Freedom to a Forraign Sway; \n
And while thus ore your selves you Queens remain, \n
Unenvy'd, ore the World, let others reign: \n
The highest Joy which from Dominion flows, \n
Is short of what a Mind well-govern'd knows. \n
Whither my Muse, would'st uncontrouled run? \n
Contend in Motion with the restless Sun? \n
Immortal thou, but I a mortal Sire \n
Exhaust my strength, and Hearers also tire. \n
Al. O Heaven-taught Bard! to Ages couldst prolong \n
Thy Soul-instructing, Health-infusing Song, \n
I with unweary'd Appetite could hear, \n
And wish my Senses were turn'd all to Ear. \n
Alcim. Old Man, thy frosty Precepts well betray \n
Thy Blood is cold, and that thy Head is grey: \n
Who past the Pleasure Love and Youth can give, \n
To spoyl't in others, now dost only live. \n
Wouldst thou, indeed, if so thou couldst perswade, \n
The Fair, whose Charms have many Lovers made, \n
Should feel Compassion for no one they wound, \n
But be to all Inexorable found? \n
Me. Young man, if my advice thou well hadst weigh'd, \n
Thou would'st have found, for either Sex 'twas made; \n
And would from Womens Beauty thee no less \n
Preserve, than them secure from thy Address. \n
But let thy Youth thy rash Reproach excuse. \n
Alci. Fairest Amira let him not abuse \n
Thy gentle Heart, by his imprinting there \n
His doting Maxims—But I will not fear: \n
For when 'gainst Love he fiercest did inveigh, \n
Methoughts I saw thee turn with Scorn away. \n
Ami. Alcimedon according to his Will \n
Does all my Words and Looks interpret still: \n
But I shall learn at length how to Disdain, \n
Or at the least more cunningly to feign. \n
Alci. No wonder thou Alcimedon art rude, \n
When with no Gen'rous Quality endu'd: \n
But hop'st by railing Words Vice to defend, \n
Which Foulers made, by having such a Friend. \n
Amira, thou art warn'd, wisely beware, \n
Leap not with Open-Eyes into the Snare: \n
The Faith that's given to thee, was given before \n
To Nais, Amoret, and many more: \n
The Perjur'd did the Gods to Witness call, \n
That unto each he was the only Thrall. \n
Aste. Y'ave made his Cheeks with Conscious blushes glow. \n
Alci. 'Tis the best Colour a False Heart can show; \n
And well it is with Guilt some shame remains. \n
Meli. Hast, Shepherd, hast to cleanse away thy stains, \n
Let not thy Youth, of Time the goodly spring, \n
Neglected pass, that nothing forth it bring \n
But noxious Weeds: which cultivated might \n
Produce such Crops, as now would thee delight, \n
And give thee after Fame For Vertues Fruit \n
Believe it, not alone with Age does sute, \n
Nought adorns Youth like to a Noble Mind, \n
In thee this Union let Amira find. \n
Lici. O fear her not! she'l serve him in his kind. \n
Meli. See how Discourse upon the Time does prey, \n
Those hours pass swiftest, that we talk away. \n
Declining Sol forsaken hath the Fields, \n
And Mountains highest Summits only gildes: \n
Which warns us home-wards with our Flocks to make. \n
Alci. Along with thee our Thanks and Praises take. \n
Aste. In which our Hearts do all in One unite, \n
Lici. Our Wishes too, That on thy Head may light, \n
What e're the Gods as their Best Gifts bestow. \n
Meli. Kind Nymphs on you may Equal Blessings flow. \n<|endoftext|>

The morn dispensed a dubious light, \n
A sudden mist had stolen from sight \n
Each pleasing vale and hill; \n
When Damon left his humble bowers, \n
To guard his flocks, to fence his flowers, \n
Or check his wandering rill. \n
Though school'd from Fortune's paths to fly, \n
The swain beneath each lowering sky \n
Would oft his fate bemoan, \n
That he, in sylvan shades forlorn, \n
Must waste his cheerless even and morn, \n
Nor praised, nor loved, nor known. \n
No friend to Fame's obstreperous noise, \n
Yet to the whispers of her voice, \n
Soft murmuring, not a foe: \n
The pleasures he through choice declined, \n
When gloomy fogs depress'd his mind, \n
It grieved him to forego. \n
Grieved him to lurk the lakes beside, \n
Where coots in rushy dingles hide, \n
And moorcocks shun the day; \n
While caitiff bitterns, undismay'd, \n
Remark the swain's familiar shade, \n
And scorn to quit their prey. \n
But see the radiant sun once more, \n
The brightening face of heaven restore, \n
And raise the doubtful dawn; \n
And, more to gild his rural sphere, \n
At once the brightest train appear \n
That ever trod the lawn. \n
Amazement chill'd the shepherd's frame, \n
To think Bridgewater's honour'd name \n
Should grace his rustic cell; \n
That she, on all whose motions wait \n
Distinction, titles, rank, and state, \n
Should rove where shepherds dwell. \n
But true it is, the generous mind, \n
By candour sway'd, by taste refined, \n
Will nought but vice disdain; \n
Nor will the breast where fancy glows, \n
Deem every flower a weed that blows \n
Amid the desert plain. \n
Beseems it such, with honour crown'd, \n
To deal its lucid beams around, \n
Nor equal meed receive; \n
At most such garlands from the field, \n
As cowslips, pinks, and pansies, yield, \n
And rural hands can weave. \n
Yet strive, ye shepherds! strive to find, \n
And weave the fairest of the kind, \n
The prime of all the spring; \n
If haply thus you lovely fair \n
May, round her temples, deign to wear \n
The trivial wreaths you bring. \n
O how the peaceful halcyons play'd, \n
Where'er the conscious lake betray'd \n
Athena's placid mien! \n
How did the sprightlier linnets throng, \n
Where Paphia's charms required the song, \n
'Mid hazel copses green! \n
Lo, Dartmouth on those banks reclined, \n
While busy Fancy calls to mind \n
The glories of his line! \n
Methinks my cottage rears its head, \n
The ruin'd walls of yonder shed, \n
As through enchantment, shine. \n
But who the nymph that guides their way? \n
Could ever nymph descend to stray \n
From Hagley's famed retreat? \n
Else, by the blooming features fair, \n
The faultless make, the matchless air, \n
'Twere Cynthia's form complete. \n
So would some tuberose delight, \n
That struck the pilgrim's wondering sight \n
'Mid lonely deserts drear; \n
All as at eve, the sovereign flower \n
Dispenses round its balmy power, \n
And crowns the fragrant year. \n
Ah! now no more, the shepherd cried, \n
Must I Ambition's charms deride, \n
Her subtle force disown; \n
No more of Fauns or Fairies dream, \n
While Fancy, near each crystal stream, \n
Shall paint these forms alone. \n
By low-brow'd rock or pathless mead, \n
I deem'd that splendour ne'er should lead \n
My dazzled eyes astray; \n
But who, alas! will dare contend, \n
If beauty add, or merit blend, \n
Its more illustrious ray? \n
Nor is it long, O plaintive swain! \n
Since Guernsey saw, without disdain, \n
Where, hid in woodlands green, \n
The partner of his early days, \n
And once the rival of his praise, \n
Had stolen through life unseen. \n
Scarce faded is the vernal flower, \n
Since Stamford left his honour'd bower \n
To smile familiar here: \n
O form'd by Nature to disclose, \n
How fair that courtesy which flows \n
From social warmth sincere! \n
Nor yet have many moons decay'd, \n
Since Pollio sought this lonely shade, \n
Admired this rural maze: \n
The noblest breast that Virtue fires, \n
The Graces love, the Muse inspires, \n
Might pant for Pollio's praise. \n
Say, Thomson here was known to rest; \n
For him you vernal seat I drest, \n
Ah, never to return! \n
In place of wit and melting strains, \n
And social mirth, it now remains \n
To weep beside his urn. \n
Come then, my Lelius! come once more, \n
And fringe the melancholy shore \n
With roses and with bays, \n
While I each wayward Fate accuse, \n
That envied his impartial Muse, \n
To sing your early praise. \n
While Philo, to whose favour'd sight \n
Antiquity, with full delight, \n
Her inmost wealth displays; \n
Beneath yon ruin's moulder'd wall \n
Shall muse, and with his friends recall \n
The pomp of ancient days. \n
Here, too, shall Conway's name appear; \n
He praised the stream so lovely clear, \n
That shone the reeds among; \n
Yet clearness could it not disclose, \n
To match the rhetoric that flows \n
From Conway's polish'd tongue. \n
Even Pitt, whose fervent periods roll \n
Resistless through the kindling soul \n
Of senates, councils, kings- \n
Though form'd for courts, vouchsafed to rove, \n
Inglorious, through the shepherd's grove, \n
And ope his bashful springs. \n
But what can courts discover more \n
Than these rude haunts have seen before, \n
Each fount and shady tree? \n
Have not these trees and fountains seen \n
The pride of courts, the winning mien \n
Of peerless Aylesbury? \n
And Grenville, she whose radiant eyes \n
Have mark'd by slow gradation rise \n
The princely piles of Stowe; \n
Yet praised these unembellish'd woods, \n
And smiled to see the babbling floods \n
Through self-worn mazes flow. \n
Say, Dartmouth, who your banks admired, \n
Again beneath your caves retired, \n
Shall grace the pensive shade; \n
With all the bloom, with all the truth, \n
With all the sprightliness of youth, \n
By cool reflection sway'd? \n
Brave, yet humane, shall Smith appear; \n
Ye sailors! though his name be dear, \n
Think him not yours alone: \n
Grant him in other spheres to charm; \n
The shepherds' breasts though mild are warm, \n
And ours are all his own. \n
O Lyttleton! my honour'd guest, \n
Could I describe thy generous breast, \n
Thy firm yet polish'd mind; \n
How public love adorns thy name, \n
How Fortune, too, conspires with Fame; \n
The song should please mankind. \n<|endoftext|>

The Pastoral Heroic Couplet \n
February 24, 2020 \n
The early morning starts with moo and baa \n
Shepherd opens door singing la, la, la; \n
Bleat, bleat continue the goats and the sheep \n
The shepherd starts sipping on the hot cup, \n
Soon all get ready for pastoral field \n
Day long eating, feeding, singing go right. \n<|endoftext|>
pastoral \n
I am no shepherd of a child's surmises. \n
I have seen fear where the coiled serpent rises, \n
Thirst where the grasses burn in early May \n
And thistle, mustard, and the wild oat stay. \n
There is dust in this air. I saw in the heat \n
Grasshoppers busy in the threshing wheat. \n
So to this hour. Through the warm dusk I drove \n
To blizzards sifting on the hissing stove, \n
And found no images of pastoral will, \n
But fear, thirst, hunger, and this huddled chill. \n<|endoftext|>
pastoral \n
So, this is all, — the utmost reach \n
Of priestly power the mind to fetter! \n
When laymen think, when women preach, \n
A war of words, a 'Pastoral Letter!' \n
Now, shame upon ye, parish Popes! \n
Was it thus with those, your predecessors, \n
Who sealed with racks, and fire, and ropes \n
Their loving-kindness to transgressors? \n
A 'Pastoral Letter,' grave and dull; \n
Alas! in hoof and horns and features, \n
How different is your Brookfield bull \n
From him who bellows from St. Peter's! \n
Your pastoral rights and powers from harm, \n
Think ye, can words alone preserve them? \n
Your wiser fathers taught the arm \n
And sword of temporal power to serve them. \n
Oh, glorious days, when Church and State \n
Were wedded by your spiritual fathers! \n
And on submissive shoulders sat \n
Your Wilsons and your Cotton Mathers, \n
No vile 'itinerant' then could mar \n
The beauty of your tranquil Zion, \n
But at his peril of the scar \n
Of hangman's whip and branding-iron. \n
Then, wholesome laws relieved the Church \n
Of heretic and mischief-maker, \n
And priest and bailiff joined in search, \n
By turns, of Papist, witch, and Quaker! \n
The stocks were at each church's door, \n
The gallows stood on Boston Common, \n
A Papist's ears the pillory bore, — \n
The gallows-rope, a Quaker woman! \n
Your fathers dealt not as ye deal \n
With 'non-professing' frantic teachers; \n
They bored the tongue with red-hot steel, \n
And flayed the backs of 'female preachers.' \n
Old Hampton, had her fields a tongue, \n
And Salem's streets could tell their story, \n
Of fainting woman dragged along, \n
Gashed by the whip accursed and gory! \n
And will ye ask me, why this taunt \n
Of memories sacred from the scorner? \n
And why with reckless hand I plant \n
A nettle on the graves ye honor? \n
Not to reproach New England's dead \n
This record from the past I summon, \n
Of manhood to the scaffold led, \n
And suffering and heroic woman. \n
No, for yourselves alone, I turn \n
The pages of intolerance over, \n
That, in their spirit, dark and stern, \n
Ye haply may your own discover! \n
For, if ye claim the 'pastoral right' \n
To silence Freedom's voice of warning, \n
And from your precincts shut the light \n
Of Freedom's day around ye dawning; \n
If when an earthquake voice of power \n
And signs in earth and heaven are showing \n
That forth, in its appointed hour, \n
The Spirit of the Lord is going! \n
And, with that Spirit, Freedom's light \n
On kindred, tongue, and people breaking, \n
Whose slumbering millions, at the sight, \n
In glory and in strength are waking! \n
When for the sighing of the poor, \n
And for the needy, God hath risen, \n
And chains are breaking, and a door \n
Is opening for the souls in prison! \n
If then ye would, with puny hands, \n
Arrest the very work of Heaven, \n
And bind anew the evil bands \n
Which God's right arm of power hath riven; \n
What marvel that, in many a mind, \n
Those darker deeds of bigot madness \n
Are closely with your own combined, \n
Yet 'less in anger than in sadness '? \n
What marvel, if the people learn \n
To claim the right of free opinion? \n
What marvel, if at times they spurn \n
The ancient yoke of your dominion? \n
A glorious remnant linger yet, \n
Whose lips are wet at Freedom's fountains, \n
The coming of whose welcome feet \n
Is beautiful upon our mountains! \n
Men, who the gospel tidings bring \n
Of Liberty and Love forever, \n
Whose joy is an abiding spring, \n
Whose peace is as a gentle river! \n
But ye, who scorn the thrilling tale \n
Of Carolina's high-souled daughters, \n
Which echoes here the mournful wail \n
Of sorrow from Edisto's waters, \n
Close while ye may the public ear, \n
With malice vex, with slander wound them, \n
The pure and good shall throng to hear, \n
And tried and manly hearts surround them. \n
Oh, ever may the power which led \n
Their way to such a fiery trial, \n
And strengthened womanhood to tread \n
The wine-press of such self-denial, \n
Be round them in an evil land, \n
With wisdom and with strength from Heaven, \n
With Miriam's voice, and Judith's hand, \n
And Deborah's song, for triumph given! \n
And what are ye who strive with God \n
Against the ark of His salvation, \n
Moved by the breath of prayer abroad, \n
With blessings for a dying nation? \n
What, but the stubble and the hay \n
To perish, even as flax consuming, \n
With all that bars His glorious way, \n
Before the brightness of His coming? \n
And thou, sad Angel, who so long \n
Hast waited for the glorious token, \n
That Earth from all her bonds of wrong \n
To liberty and light has broken, — \n
Angel of Freedom! soon to thee \n
The sounding trumpet shall be given, \n
And over Earth's full jubilee \n
Shall deeper joy be felt in Heaven! \n<|endoftext|>

Who would not this saint adore? \n

O, fair eyes, yet let me see, \n
One good look, and I am gone: \n
Look on me, for I am he, \n

Pastoral romantic life is the best way to live \n
In harmony with Nature full of lovely beauty, \n
Satisfaction and bliss in this world now sure! \n
This is the reason many opt for resorts to farm \n
Houses to enjoy holidays in peace and tranquility \n
To enjoy the bliss they are longing for in Nature! \n
Beauty and love together is a great boon to enjoy \n
Not anywhere in the modern world but only in Nature \n

Even religions highlight pastoral lords preaching \n

While in heroic numbers some relate \n
The amazing turns of wise eternal fate; \n
Exploits of heroes in the dusty field, \n
That to their name immortal honour yield; \n
Grant me, ye powers, by the limpid spring \n
The harmless of the plain to sing, \n
A wreath of flowers cull'd from the \n
Is all the my humble muse demands. \n
Now blithsome shepherds, by the early dawn, \n
Their new shorn flocks drive to the dewy lawn; \n
While, in a bleating language, each salutes \n
The welcome morning and their fellow brutes: \n
Then all prepared for the rural feast, \n
And in their finest Sunday habits drest; \n
The crystal brook supplied the mirror's place, \n
They bathed and viewed their cleanly face, \n
And nymphs resorted to the fields \n
Pomp the country yields. \n
The place appointed was a spacious vale, \n
Fann'd always by a cooling western gale, \n
Which in soft breezes through the meadows stray, \n
And steals the ripened fragrancies away; \n
Here every shepherd might his flocks survey, \n
Securely roam and take his harmless play; \n
And here were flowers each shepherdess to grace, \n
On her fair bosom courting but a place. \n
How in this vale, beneath a grateful shade, \n
By twining boughs of spreading made, \n
On seats of homely turf themselves they place, \n
And cheerfully enjoyed the rural feast, \n
Consisting of the produce of the fields, \n
And all the luxury the country yields. \n
No maddening liquors spoil'd their harmless mirth, \n
But an untainted spring their thirst allayed, \n
Which in meadows through the valley strayed. \n
Thrice happy swains who spend your golden days \n
In pastime; and when night displays \n
Her sable shade, to peaceful huts retire; \n
Can any man a sweeter bliss desire? \n
In ancient times so pass'd the smiling hour, \n
When our first parents lived in Eden's bower, \n
E'er care and trouble were pronounced, \n
Or sin had blasted the creation. \n<|endoftext|>

Here is the dusk with its pink plastic bag \n
in the tines of a branch, the wheeze \n
in the wind's throat before the wind lies \n
down on water. Here is the brink \n
revealing the icy spring's pulmonary \n
green, the grasses softly becoming. \n
The water is like the dark part of an x-ray \n
sheet, possessing into itself \n
the shadows building between trees, shrubs \n
roundly black like pots. Traced \n
onto nothing, here is my grandfather \n
pushing breath out of his locking \n
lungs, and memory dividing like his cells: \n
the papery, hollowed-out face; \n
the brown mash of herbs he sipped, trying \n
to outwit what had lodged there, \n
the crone of another self, the enraged \n
sibyl shrinking, taking the world \n
of him with it. It is stupid to keep seeing \n
the body in the world, its parts \n
illuminated in the easy salary of images: \n
hospital tubes in the coiled garden \n
hose, the plastic bag in the tree waiting \n
like a lyre. And yet by these errors \n
what's beneath is sometimes fathomable: \n
you running on the Potomac's banks, \n
your lungs pumped with the medicine that \n
cures you as it didn't my grandfather, \n
the rain drumming mist out of the ground, \n
the mud a gradually clinging weight. \n
Heading back, you decide to scale a country \n
club's wall, diving naked into \n
the unguarded pool to wash off the mud. \n
You tell me this as I try to unfurl your \n
hands, and you finally open them, showing \n
damage that a door or hammer has \n
brought on each knuckle, the outlasting scars \n
coarse as the nodes on a branch. \n<|endoftext|>

Flinging the cups and dishes, \n
Rolling on the muddy floor \n

Being lost in books and rapt in studies \n

Ye shepherds so chearful and gay, \n
Whose flocks never carelessly roam; \n
Should Corydon's happen to stray, \n
Oh! call the poor wanderers home. \n
Allow me to muse and to sigh, \n
Nor talk of the change that ye find; \n
None once was so watchful as I; \n
-- I have left my dear Phyllis behind. \n
Now I know what it is, to have strove \n
With the torture of doubt and desire; \n
What it is, to admire and to love, \n
And to leave her we love and admire. \n
Ah lead forth my flock in the morn, \n
And the damps of each ev'ning repel; \n
Alas! I am faint and forlorn: \n
-- I have bade my dear Phyllis farewel. \n
Since Phyllis vouchsaf'd me a look, \n
I never once dreamt of my vine; \n
May I lose both my pipe and my crook, \n
If I knew of a kid that was mine. \n
I priz'd every hour that went by, \n
Beyond all that had pleas'd me before; \n
But now they are past, and I sigh; \n
And I grieve that I priz'd them no more. \n
But why do I languish in vain; \n
Why wander thus pensively here? \n
Oh! why did I come from the plain, \n
Where I fed on the smiles of my dear? \n
They tell me, my favourite maid, \n
The pride of that valley, is flown; \n
Alas! where with her I have stray'd, \n
I could wander with pleasure, alone. \n
When forc'd the fair nymph to forego, \n
What anguish I felt at my heart! \n
Yet I thought -- but it might not be so -- \n
'Twas with pain that she saw me depart. \n
She gaz'd, as I slowly withdrew; \n
My path I could hardly discern; \n
So sweetly she bade me adieu, \n
I thought that she bade me return. \n
The pilgrim that journeys all day \n
To visit some far-distant shrine, \n
If he bear but a relique away, \n
Is happy, nor heard to repine. \n
Thus widely remov'd from the fair, \n
Where my vows, my devotion, I owe, \n
Soft hope is the relique I bear, \n
And my solace wherever I go. \n<|endoftext|>

Thir. \n
Say, tell me true, what is the doleful cause \n
That Corydon is not the man he was? \n
Your cheerful presence used to lighten cares, \n
And from the plains to banish gloomy fears. \n
Whene'er unto the circling swains you sung \n
Our ravish'd souls upon the music hung; \n
The gazing, listening flocks forgot their meat, \n
While vocal grottos did your lays repeat: \n
But now your gravity our mirth rebukes, \n
And in your downcast and desponding looks \n
Appears some fatal and impending woe; \n
I fear to ask, and yet desire to know. \n
Cor. \n
The doleful news, how shall I, Thirsis, tell! \n
In blooming youth the hapless Damon fell: \n
He's dead, he's dead, and with him all my joy; \n
The mournful thought does all gay forms destroy: \n
This is the cause of my unusual grief, \n
Which sullenly admits of no relief. \n
Thir. \n
Begone all mirth! begone all sports and play, \n
To a deluge of grief and tears give way. \n
Damon the just, the generous, and the young, \n
Must Damon's worth and merit be unsung? \n
No, Corydon, the wondrous youth you knew \n
How as in years so he in virtue grew; \n
Embalm his fame in never dying verse, \n
As a just tribute to his doleful hearse. \n
Cor. \n
Assist me, mighty grief, my breast inspire \n
With generous heats and with thy wildest fire, \n
While in a solemn and a mournful strain \n
Of Damon gone for ever I complain. \n
Ye muses, weep; your mirth and songs forbear, \n
And for him sigh and shed a friendly tear; \n
He was your favourite, and by your aid \n
In charming verse his witty thoughts array'd; \n
He had of knowledge, learning, wit, a store, \n
To it denied he still press'd after more. \n
He was a pious and a virtuous soul, \n
And still press'd forward to the heavenly goal; \n
He was a faithful, true, and constant friend, \n
Faithful, and true, and constant to the end. \n
Ye flowers, hang down and droop your heads, \n
No more around your grateful odours spread; \n
Ye leafy trees, your blooming honours shed, \n
Damon for ever from your shade is fled; \n
Fled to the mansions of eternal light, \n
Where endless wonders strike his happy sight. \n
Ye birds, be mute, as through the trees you fly, \n
Mute as the grave wherein my friend does lie. \n
Ye winds, breathe sighs as through the air you rove, \n
And in sad pomp the trembling branches move. \n
Ye gliding brooks, O weep your channels dry, \n
My flowing tears them fully shall supply; \n
You in soft murmurs may your grief express, \n
And yours, you swains, in mournful songs compress. \n
I to some dark and gloomy shade will fly, \n
Dark as the grave wherein my friend does lie; \n
And for his death to lonely rocks complain \n
In mournful accents and a dying strain, \n
While pining echo answers me again. \n<|endoftext|>

Dear Madam, \n
As the following Poem turns chiefly on the danger of Delay or Error in the important article of Education, I know not to whom I can, with more propriety, dedicate it, than to you, as the subject it inculcates has been one of the principal objects of your attention in your own family. \n
Let not the name of Dedication alarm you; I am not going to offend you by making your Eulogium. Panegyric is only necessary to suspicious characters; Virtue will not accept it; Delicacy will not offer it. \n
The friendship with which you have honoured me from my childhood, will, I flatter myself, induce you to pardon me for venturing to lay before you this public testimony of my esteem, and to assure you how much I am, \n
Dear Madam, \n
Your obedient \n
And obliged humble servant, \n
THE AUTHOR. \n
PREFACE. \n
The object of the following Poem, which was written in very early youth, was an earnest wish to furnish a substitute for the very improper custom, which then prevailed, of allowing plays, and those not always of the purest kind, to be acted by young Ladies in boarding schools. And it has afforded a serious satisfaction to the Author to learn that this little Poem, and likewise the Sacred Dramas, have very frequently been adopted to supply the place of those more dangerous amusements. If it may be still happily instrumental in promoting a regard to Religion and Virtue in the minds of young persons, and afford them an innocent, and perhaps not altogether unuseful, amusement in the exercise of recitation, the end for which it was originally composed, and the author's utmost wish in its re-publication, will be fully answered. \n
PROLOGUE. \n
Spoken By A Young Lady. \n
In these grave scenes, and unembellish'd strains, \n
Where neither sly intrigue nor passion reigns; \n
How dare we hope an audience will approve \n
A Drama void of wit, and free from love? \n
Where no soft Juliet sighs, and weeps, and starts, \n
No fierce Roxana takes by storm your hearts; \n
No comic ridicule, no tragic swagger, \n
Not one elopement, not one bowl or dagger? \n
No husband wrong'd, who trusted and believed, \n
No father cheated, and no friend deceived; \n
No libertine in glowing strains described, \n
No lying chambermaid that rake had bribed: \n
Nor give we, to reward the rover's life, \n
The ample portion and the beauteous wife: \n
Behold, to raise the manners of the age, \n
The frequent moral of the scenic page! \n
And shall we then transplant these noxious scnes \n
To private life? to misses in their teens? \n
The pompous tone, the masculine attire, \n
The stilts, the buskin, the dramatic fire, \n
Corrupt the softness of the gentler kind, \n
And taint the sweetness of the youthful mind. \n
Ungovern'd passions, jealousy and rage, \n
But ill become our sex, still less our age; \n
Whether we learn too well what we describe, \n
Or fail the Poet's meaning to imbibe; \n
In either case your blame we justly raise, \n
In either lose, or ought to lose, your praise. \n
How dull, if tamely flows th' impassion'd strain; \n
If well -- how bad to be the thing we feign; \n
To fix the mimic scene upon the heart, \n
And keep the passions when we quit the part! \n
Such are the perils the dramatic muse, \n
In youthful bosoms threatens to infuse; \n
Our timid Author labours to impart \n
A less pernicious lesson to the heart; \n
What, though no charm of melody divine, \n
Smooth her round period, or adorn her line; \n
Though her unpolish'd page in vain aspires \n
To emulate the graces she admires; \n
Though destitute of skill, her sole pretence \n
But aims at simple truth and common sense; \n
Yet shall her honest unassuming page \n
Tell that its Author in a modish age, \n
Preferr'd plain virtue to the boast of art, \n
Nor fix'd one dangerous maxim on the heart. \n
Oh if, to crown her efforts, she could find, \n
They rooted but one error from one mind; \n
If in the bosom of ingenuous youth \n
They stamp'd one useful thought, one lasting truth, \n
'Twould be a fairer tribute to her name, \n
Than loud applause, or an empty fame! \n
The Search After Happiness. \n
SCENE -- A Grove. \n
Euphelia, Cleora, Pastorella, Laurinda. \n
Cleora. \n
Welcome, ye humble vales, ye flow'ry shades, \n
Ye crystal fountains, and ye silent glades! \n
From the gay misery of the thoughtless great, \n
The walks of folly, the disease of state; \n
From scenes where daring guilt triumphant reigns, \n
Its dark suspicions and its hoard of pains; \n
Where Pleasure never comes without alloy, \n
And Art but thinly paints fallacious joy; \n
Where Languour loads the day, Excess the night, \n
And dull Satiety succeeds Delight; \n
Where midnight Vices their fell orgies keep, \n
And guilty Revels scare the phantom Sleep; \n
Where Dissipations wears the name of Bliss: \n
From these we fly in search of Happiness. \n
Euphelia. \n
Not the tir'd Pilgrim, all his dangers past, \n
When he descries the long-sought shrine at last; \n
E'er felt a joy so pure as this fair field, \n
These peaceful shades, and smiling valleys yield; \n
For sure, these oaks, which old as Time appear, \n
Proclaim Urania's lonely dwelling near. \n
Pastorella. \n
How the description with the scene agrees! \n
Here lowly thickets, there aspiring trees; \n
The hazel copse excluding noon-day's beam, \n
The tufted arbour, the pellucid stream; \n
The blooming sweet-briar, and the hawthorn shade, \n
The springing cowslips, and the daisy'd mead; \n
The wild luxuriance of the full-blown fields, \n
Which Spring prepares, and laughing Summer yields! \n
Euphelia. \n
Here simple Nature strikes the enraptured eye \n
With charms, which wealth and art but ill supply; \n
The genuine graces, which without we find, \n
Display the beauty of the owner's mind. \n
Laurinda. \n
These deep embowering shades conceal the cell, \n
Where sage Urania and her daughters dwell: \n
Florella too, if right we've heard the tale, \n
With them resides -- the lilly of the vale. \n
Cleora. \n
But soft; what gentle female form appears, \n
Which smiles of more than mortal beauty wears? \n
Is it the Guardian Genius of the grove? \n
Or some fair angel from the choirs above! \n
Enter Florella, who speaks. \n
Whom do I see? ye beauteous virgins, say, \n
What chance conducts your steps this lonely way? \n
Do you pursue some favourite lambkin stray'd? \n
Or do yon alders court you to their shade? \n
Declare, fair strangers! If aright I deem, \n
No rustic nymph of vulgar rank you seem. \n
Cleora. \n
No cooling shades allure our eager sight, \n
Nor lambkins lost, our searching steps invite. \n
Florella. \n
Or is it, haply, yonder branching vine, \n
Whose tendrils round our low-roof'd cottage twine; \n
Whose spreading height, with purple clusters crown'd, \n
Attracts the gaze of every nymph around? \n
Have these lone regions aught that charms beside? \n
Yours are my shades, my flowers, my fleecy pride. \n
Euphelia. \n
Florella! our united thanks receive; \n
Sole proof of gratitude we have to give: \n
And since you deign to ask, O courteous fair! \n
The motive of our unremitting care; \n
Know then, kind maid, our joint researches tend \n
To find that sovereign good of life, a friend; \n
From whom the wholesome counsel we may gain, \n
How our young hearts may happiness obtain. \n
By Fancy's mimic pencil oft portray'd, \n
Still have we woo'd the visionary maid: \n
The lovely phantom mocks our eager eyes; \n
And still we chase, and still we miss the prize! \n
Cleora. \n
Long have we search'd throughout this bounteous isle, \n
With constant ardour and with ceaseless toil; \n
The various ways of various life we've tried; \n
But still the bliss we seek has been deny'd. \n
We've sought in vain through every different state; \n
The murmuring poor, the discontented great. \n
If Peace, and Joy, in palaces reside, \n
Or in obscurer haunts delight to hide; \n
If Happiness with worldly pleasures dwell, \n
Or shrouds her graces in the hermit's cell: \n
If Wit, if Science, teach the road to bliss, \n
Or torpid dulness find the joys they miss; \n
To learn this truth, we've bid a long adieu \n
To all the shadows blinded men pursue. \n
-- We seek Urania; whose sagacious mind \n
May lead our steps this latent good to find: \n
Her worth we emulate; her virtues fire \n
Our ardent hearts to be what we admire: \n
For though with care she shuns the public eye, \n
Yet worth like hers, unknown can never lie. \n
Laurinda. \n
On such a fair faultless model form'd, \n
By Prudence guided, and by Virtue warm'd, \n
Perhaps Florella can direct our youth, \n
And point our footsteps to the paths of Truth. \n
Florella. \n
Ill would it suit my unexperienced age \n
In such important questions to engage. \n
Young as I am, unskilful to discern, \n
Nor fit to teach, who yet have much to learn. \n
But would you with maturer years advise, \n
And reap the counsel of the truly wise, \n
The dame in whom such worth and wisdom meet, \n
All that the world calls great she once possess'd, \n
With wealth, with rank, her prosperous youth was bless'd. \n
In adverse fortune, now, serene and gay, \n
'Who gave,' she said, 'had right to take away.' \n
Two lovely daughters bless her growing years, \n
And, by their virtues, well repay her cares. \n
With them, beneath her sheltering wing I live, \n
And share the bounties she has still to give; \n
For Heaven, who in its dispensations join'd \n
A narrow fortune to a noble mind, \n
Has bless'd the sage Urania with a heart \n
Which Wisdom's noblest treasures can impart; \n
In Duty's active roud each day is past, \n
As if she thought each day might prove her last: \n
Her labours for devotion best prepare, \n
And meek Devotion smooths the brow of Care. \n
Pastorella. \n
Then lead, Florella, to that humble shed \n
Where Peace resides: from courts and cities fled; \n
SONG. \n
O Happiness, celestial fair, \n
Our earliest hope, our latest care, \n
Oh hear our fond request! \n
Vouchsafe, reluctant Nymph, to tell \n
On what sweet spot thou lov'st to dwell, \n
And make us truly blest. \n
Amidst the walks of public life, \n
The toils of wealth, ambition's strife, \n
We long have sought in vain: \n
The crowded city's noisy din, \n
And all the busy haunts of men, \n
Afford but care and pain. \n
Pleased with the soft, the soothing power \n
Of calm Reflection's silent hour, \n
Sequester'd dost thou dwell? \n
Where care and tumult ne'er intrude, \n
Dost thou reside with Solitude? \n
Thy humble votaries tell. \n
O Happiness, celestial fair, \n
Our earliest hope, our latest care \n
Let us not sue in vain! \n
O deign to hear our fond request, \n
Come, take possession of our breast, \n
And there for ever reign. \n
SCENE -- The Grove. \n
Urania, Sylvia, Eliza. \n
Sylvia (singing). \n
Sweet Solitude, thou placid queen \n
Of modest air, and brow serene! \n
'Tis thou inspirest the Sage's themes; \n
The poet's visionary dreams. \n
Parent of Virtue, nurse of Thought! \n
By thee were Saints and Patriarchs taught; \n
Wisdom from thee her treasures drew, \n
And in thy lap fair Science grew. \n
Whate'er exalts, refines, and charms, \n
Invites to thought, to virtue warms; \n
Whate'er is perfect, fair, and good, \n
We owe to thee, sweet Solitude! \n
In these blest shades, O still maintain \n
Thy peaceful, unmolested reign! \n
Let no disorder'd thoughts intrude \n
On thy repose, sweet Solitude! \n
With thee the charm of life shall last, \n
Although its rosy bloom be past; \n
Shall still endure when Time shall spread \n
His silver blossoms o'er my head. \n
No more with this vain world perplex'd, \n
Thou shalt prepare me for the next; \n
The springs of life shall gently cease, \n
And angels point the way to peace. \n
Urania. \n
Ye tender objects of maternal love, \n
Ye dearest joys my widow'd heart can prove, \n
Come, taste the glories of the new-born day, \n
And grateful homage to its author pay! \n
Oh! ever may this animating sight \n
Convey instruction while it sheds delight! \n
Does not that sun, whose cheering beams impart \n
Joy's glad emotions to the pure in heart; \n
Does not that vivid power teach every mind \n
To be as warm, benevolent and kind; \n
To burn with unremitted ardour still, \n
Like him to execute their Maker's will; \n
Then let us, Power Supreme! thy will adore. \n
Invoke thy mercies, and proclaim thy power. \n
Shalt thou these benefits in vain bestow? \n
Shall we forget the fountain whence they flow? \n
Teach us through these to lift our hearts to Thee, \n
And in the gift the bounteous giver see. \n
To view Thee as thou art, all good and wise, \n
Nor let thy blessings hide thee from our eyes. \n
From all obstructions clear our mental sight; \n
Pour on our souls thy beatific light! \n
Teach us thy wondrous goodness to revere, \n
With love to worship, and with reverence fear! \n
In the mild works of thy benignant hand, \n
As in the thunder of thy dread command. \n
In common objects we neglect thy power, \n
While wonders shine in every plant and flower. \n
-- Tell me, my first, my last, my darling care, \n
If you this morn have raised your hearts in prayer? \n
Say, did you rise from the sweet bed of rest, \n
Your God unpraised, his holy name unblest? \n
Sylvia. \n
Our hearts with gratitude and rev'rence fraught, \n
By those pure precepts you have ever taught; \n
By your example, more than precept strong, \n
Of pray'r and praise have tun'd their matin song. \n
Eliza. \n
With ever-new delight, we now attend \n
The counsels of our fond maternal friend. \n
Enter Florella, with Euphelia, Cleora, Pastorella, Laurinda. \n
Florella (Aside to the Ladies). \n
See how the goodly dame, with pious art, \n
Makes each event a lesson to the heart! \n
Observe the duteous list'ners how they stand! \n
Improvement and delight go hand in hand. \n
Urania. \n
But where's Florella? \n
Florella. \n
Here's the happy she, \n
Whom Heaven most favor'd when it gave her thee. \n
Urania. \n
But who are these, in whose attractive mien, \n
So sweetly blended, ev'ry grace is seen? \n
Speak, my Florella! say the cause why here \n
These beauteous damsels on our plains appear? \n
Florella. \n
Invited hither by Urania's fame, \n
To seek her friendship, to these shades they came. \n
Straying alone at morning's earliest dawn, \n
I met them wand'ring on the distant lawn. \n
Their courteous manners soon engag'd my love: \n
I've brought them here your sage advice to prove. \n
Urania. \n
Tell me, ye gentle nymphs, the reason tell, \n
Which brings such guests to grace my lowly cell? \n
My pow'r of serving, tho' indeed but small, \n
Such as it is, you may command it all. \n
Cleora. \n
Your counsel, your advice, is all we ask! \n
And for Urania that's no irksome task. \n
'Tis happiness we seek: O deign to tell \n
Where the coy fugitive delights to dwell! \n
Urania. \n
Ah, rather say where you have sought this guest, \n
This lovely inmate of the virtuous breast? \n
Declare the various methods you've essay'd \n
To court and win the bright celestial maid. \n
But first, tho' harsh the task, each beauteous fair \n
Her ruling passion must with truth declare. \n
From evil habits own'd, from faults confess'd, \n
Alone we trace the secrets of the breast. \n
Euphelia. \n
Bred in the regal splendours of a court, \n
Wher pleasures, dress'd in every shape, resort, \n
I try'd the pow'r of pomp and costly glare, \n
Nor e'er found room for thought, or time for pray'r: \n
In diff'rent follies ev'ry hour I spent; \n
I shunn'd Reflection, yet I sought Content. \n
My hours were shar'd betwixt the park and play, \n
And music serv'd to waste the tedious day; \n
Yet softest airs no more with joy I heard, \n
If any sweeter warbler was preferr'd; \n
The dance succeeded, and, succeeding, tir'd, \n
If some more graceful dancer were admir'd. \n
No sounds but flatt'ry ever sooth'd my ear: \n
Ungentle truths I knew not how to bear. \n
The anxious day induc'd the sleepless night, \n
And my vex'd spirit never knew delight; \n
Coy Pleasure mock'd me with delusive charms; \n
Still the thin shadow fled my clasping arms. \n
Or if some actual joy I seem'd to taste, \n
Another's pleasures laid my blessings waste: \n
One truth I prov'd, that lurking Envy hides \n
In ev'ry heart where Vanity presides. \n
A fairer face would rob my soul of rest, \n
And fix a scorpion in my wounded breast. \n
Or, if my elegance of form prevail'd, \n
And haply her inferior graces fail'd; \n
Yet still some cause of wretchedness I found, \n
Some barbed shaft my shatter'd peace to wound. \n
Perhaps her gay attire exceeded mine-- \n
When she was finer, how could I be fine? \n
Sylvia. \n
Pardon my interruption, beauteous maid! \n
Can Truth have prompted what you just have said? \n
What! can the poor pre-eminence of dress \n
Ease the pain'd heart, or give it happiness? \n
Or can you think your robes, tho' rich and fine, \n
Possess intrinsic value more than mine? \n
Urania. \n
So close our nature is to vice ally'd, \n
Our very comforts are the source of pride; \n
And dress, so much corruptio reigns within, \n
Is both the consequence and cause of sin. \n
Cleora. \n
Of Happiness unfound I too complain, \n
Sought in a diff'rent path, but sought in vain! \n
I sigh'd for fame, I languish'd for renown, \n
I would be flatter'd, prais'd, admir'd, and known. \n
On daring wing my mounting spirit soar'd, \n
And Science through her boundless fields explored: \n
I scorn'd the salique laws of pedant schools, \n
Which chain our genius down by tasteless rules: \n
I long'd to burst these female bonds, which held \n
My sex in awe, by vanity impell'd: \n
To boast each various faculty of mind, \n
Thy graces, Pope! with Johnson's learning join'd: \n
Like Swift, with strongly pointed ridicule, \n
To brand the villain, and abash the fool: \n
To judge with taste, with spirit to compose, \n
Now mount in epic, now descend to prose; \n
To join, like Burke, the Beauteous and Sublime, \n
Or build, with Milton's art, 'the lofty rhyme;' \n
Thro' Fancy's fields I rang'd ; I strove to hit \n
Melmoth's chaste style, and Prior's easy wit: \n
Thy classic graces, Mason, to display, \n
And court the Muse of Elegy with Gray: \n
I rav'd of Shakespeare's flame and Dryden's rage, \n
And ev'ry charm of Otway's melting page. \n
I talk'd by rote the jargon of the schools, \n
Of critic laws, and Artistotle's rules! \n
Of passion, sentiment, and style, and grace, \n
And unities of action, time, and place. \n
The daily duties of my life forgot, \n
To study fiction, incident, and plot: \n
Howe'er the conduct of my life might err, \n
Still my dramatic plans were regular. \n
Urania. \n
Who aims at ev'ry science, soon will find \n
The field how vast, how limited the mind! \n
Cleora. \n
Abstruser studies soon my fancy caught, \n
The poet in th' astronomer forgot: \n
The schoolmen's systems now my mind employ'd, \n
Their crystal Spheres, their Atoms, and their Void, \n
Newton and Halley all my soul inspir'd, \n
And numbers less than calculations fir'd; \n
Descartes, and Euclid, shar'd my varying breast, \n
And plans and problems all my soul possess'd. \n
Less pleas'd to sing inspiring Phoebus' ray, \n
Than mark the flaming comet's devious way. \n
The pale moon dancing on the silver stream, \n
And the mild lustre of her trembling beam, \n
No more could charm my philosophic pride, \n
Which sought her influence on the flowing tide. \n
No more ideal beauties fix'd my thought, \n
Which only facts and demonstrations sought. \n
Let common eyes, I said, with transport view \n
The earth's bright verdure, or the heaven's soft blue, \n
False is the pleasure; the delight is vain, \n
Colours exist but in the vulgar brain. \n
I now with Locke trod metaphysic soil, \n
Now chas'd coy Nature thro' the tracts of Boyle; \n
To win the wreath of Fame, by Science twin'd, \n
More than the love of Science fir'd my mind. \n
I seized on Learning's superficial part, \n
And title-page and index got by heart; \n
Some learn'd authority I still would bring \n
To grace my talk, and prove -- the plainest thing: \n
This the chief transport I from science drew, \n
That all might know how much Cleora knew. \n
Not love, but wonder I aspir'd to raise, \n
And miss'd affection, while I grasp'd at praise. \n
Pastorella. \n
To me, no joys could pomp or fame impart; \n
Far softer thoughts possess'd my virgin heart. \n
No prudent parent form'd my ductile youth, \n
Nor lead my footsteps in the paths of truth. \n
Left to myself to cultivate my mind, \n
Pernicious novels their soft entrance find: \n
Their pois'nous influence led my mind astray: \n
I sigh'd for something,-- what,-- I could not say. \n
I fancy'd virtues which were never seen, \n
And died for heroes who have never been; \n
I sicken'd with disgust at sober sense, \n
And loath's the pleasures worth and truth dispense: \n
I scorn'd the manners of the world I saw; \n
My guide was fiction, and romance my law. \n
Distemper'd thoughts my wand'ring fancy fill, \n
Each wind a zephyr, and each brook a rill; \n
I found adventures in each common tale, \n
And talk'd and sigh'd to every passing gale; \n
Convers'd with echoes, woods, and shades, and bowers, \n
Cascades, and grottos, fields, and streams, and flowers. \n
Retirement, more than crowds, had learn'd to please; \n
For treach'rous Leisure feeds the soft disease. \n
There, plastic Fancy ever moulds at will \n
Th' obedient image with a dang'rous skill; \n
The charming fiction, with alluring art, \n
Awakes the passions, and infects the heart. \n
A fancy'd heroine, an ideal wife; \n
I loath'd the offices of real life. \n
These all were dull and tame, I long'd to prove \n
The gen'rous ardours of unequal love; \n
Some marvel still my wayward heart must strike, \n
Or prince, or peasant, each had charms alike: \n
Whate'er inverted nature, custom, law, \n
With joy I courted, and with transport saw. \n
In the dull walk of Virtue's quiet round, \n
No aliment my fever'd fancy found, \n
Each duty to perform observant still \n
But those which God and Nature bade me fill. \n
Eliza (to Urania.) \n
O save me from the errors of deceit, \n
And all the dangers wealth and beauty meet. \n
Pastorella. \n
Reason perverted, Fancy on her throne, \n
My soul to all my sex's softness prone; \n
I neither spoke nor look'd as mortal ought; \n
To sense abandon'd and by Folly taught: \n
A victim to Imagination's sway, \n
Which stole my health, and rest, and peace away: \n
Professions, void of meaning, I receiv'd, \n
And still I found them false -- and still believ'd: \n
Imagin'd all who courted me approv'd; \n
Who prais'd, esteem'd me; and who flatter'd lov'd. \n
Fondly I hop'd, (now vain those hopes appear,) \n
Each man was faithful, and each maid sincere. \n
Still Disappointment mock'd the ling'ring day; \n
Still new-born wishes led my soul astray. \n
When in the rolling year no joy I find, \n
I trust the next; the next will sure be kind. \n
The next, fallacious as the last appears, \n
And sends me on to still remoter years. \n
They come, they promise -- but forget to give; \n
I live not, but I still intend to live. \n
At length, deceiv'd in all my schemes of bliss, \n
I join'd these three in search of Happiness. \n
Eliza. \n
Is this the world of which we want a sight? \n
Are these the beings who are call'd polite? \n
Sylvia. \n
If so, O gracious Heaven! hear Sylvia's prayer: \n
Preserve me still in humble virtue here! \n
Far from such baneful pleasures may I live, \n
And keep, O keep, me from the taint they give! \n
Laurinda. \n
No love of Fame my torpid bosom warms, \n
No Fancy soothes me, and no Pleasure charms! \n
Yet still remote from Happiness I stray, \n
No guiding star illumes my trackless way. \n
My mind, nor wit misleads, nor passion goads, \n
But the dire rust of indolence corrodes; \n
This eating canker, with malignant stealth, \n
Destroys the vital powers of moral health. \n
Till now, I've slept on Life's tumultuous tide, \n
No principle of action for my guide. \n
From Ignorance my chief misfortunes flow; \n
I never wish'd to learn, or cared to know. \n
With every folly slow-paced time beguiled: \n
In size a woman, but in soul a child. \n
In slothful ease my moments crept away, \n
And busy trifles fill'd the tedious day; \n
I lived extempore, as Fancy fired, \n
As Chance directed, or Caprice inspired: \n
Too indolent to think, too weak to choose, \n
Too soft to blame, too gentle to refuse; \n
My character was stamp'd from those around; \n
The figures they, my mind the simple ground. \n
Fashion, with monstrous forms, the canvas stain'd, \n
Till nothing of my genuine self remain'd; \n
My pliant soul from Chance received its bent, \n
And neither good perform'd, or evil meant. \n
From right to wrong, from vice to virtue thrown, \n
No character possessing of its own. \n
To shun fatigue I made my only law; \n
Yet every night my wasted spirits saw. \n
No plan e'er mark'd the duties of the day, \n
Which stole in tasteless apathy away: \n
No energy inform'd my languid mind! \n
No joy the idle e'er must hope to find. \n
Weak indecision all my actions sway'd; \n
The day was lost before the choice was made. \n
Though more to folly than to guilt inclined, \n
A drear vacuity possess'd my mind. \n
Too old with infant sports to be amused, \n
Unfit for converse, and to books unused, \n
The wise avoided me, they could not hear \n
My senseless prattle with a patient ear. \n
I sought retreat, but found, with strange surprise, \n
Retreat is pleasant only to the wise; \n
The crowded world by vacant minds is sought, \n
Because it saves th' expense and pain of thought. \n
Disgusted, restless, every plan amiss, \n
I come with these in search of Happiness. \n
Urania. \n
O happy they for whom, in early age, \n
Enlightening knowledge spreads her letter'd page! \n
Teaches each headstrong passion to control, \n
And pours her liberal lesson on the soul! \n
Ideas grow from books, their natural food, \n
As aliment is changed to vital blood. \n
Though faithless Fortune strip her votary bare, \n
Though Malice haunt him, and though Envy tear, \n
Nor time, nor chance, nor want can e'er destroy \n
This soul-felt solace, and this bosom joy! \n
Cleora. \n
We thus united by one common fate, \n
Each discontented with her present state, \n
One common scheme pursue; resolved to know \n
If happiness can e'er be found below. \n
Urania. \n
Your candour, beauteous damsels, I approve, \n
Your foibles pity, and your merits love. \n
But ere I say the methods you must try \n
To gain the glorious prize for which you sigh, \n
Your fainting strength and spirits must be cheer'd \n
With a plain meal, by Temperance prepared. \n
Florella. \n
No luxury our humble board attends; \n
But Love and Concord are its smiling friends. \n
SONG. \n
Hail, artless Simplicity, beautiful maid, \n
In the genuine attractions of Nature array'd; \n
Let the rich and the proud and the gay and the vain, \n
Still laugh at the graces that move in thy train. \n
No charm in thy modest allurements they find; \n
The pleasures they follow a sting leave behind. \n
Can criminal passion enrapture the breast \n
Like virtue, with peace and serenity blest? \n
Oh, would you Simplicity's precepts attend, \n
Like us, with delight at her altar you'd bend; \n
The pleasures she yields would with joy be embraced; \n
You'd practise from virtue, and love them from taste. \n
The linnet enchants us the bushes among, \n
Though cheap the musician, yet sweet is the song; \n
We catch the soft warbling in air as it floats, \n
And with ecstacy hang on the ravishing notes. \n
Our water is drawn from the clearest of springs, \n
And our food, nor disease nor satiety brings; \n
Our mornings are cheerful, our labours are blest \n
Our evenings are pleasant, our nights crown'd with rest. \n
From our culture yon garden its ornaments finds, \n
And we catch at the hint for improving our minds; \n
To live to some purpose we constantly try, \n
And we mark by our actions the days as they fly. \n
Since such are the joys that Simplicity yields, \n
We may well be content with our woods and our fields: \n
How useless to us, then, ye great, were your wealth, \n
When without it we purchase both pleasure and health! \n
[They retire into the Cottage. \n
SCENE. -- A Rural Entertainment. \n
Florella, Euphelia, Cleora, Laurinda, Pastorella. \n
Florella (sings). \n
While Beauty and Pleasure are now in their prime, \n
And Folly and Fashion expect our whole time, \n
Ah! let not those phantoms our wishes engage: \n
Let us live so in youth, that we blush not in age. \n
Though the vain and the gay may allure us awhile, \n
Yet let not their flattery our prudence beguile: \n
Let us covet those charms that will never decay, \n
Nor listen to all that deceivers can say. \n
'How the tints of the rose, and the jasmine's perfume, \n
The eglantine's fragrance, the lilac's gay bloom, \n
Though fair and though fragrant, unheeded may lie, \n
For that neither is sweet when Florella is by.' \n
I sigh not for beauty, nor languish for wealth, \n
But grant me, kind Providence, virtue and health; \n
Then, richer than kings, and as happy as they \n
My days shall pass sweetly and swiftly away. \n
When age shall steal on me, and youth is no more, \n
And the moralist Time shakes his glass at my door, \n
What charm in lost beauty or wealth should I find \n
My treasure, my wealth, is a sweet peace of mind! \n
That peace I'll preserve then, as pure as was given, \n
And taste in my bosom an earnest of Heaven; \n
Thus Virtue and Wisdom can warm the cold scene, \n
And sixty may flourish as gay as sixteen. \n
And when long I the burthen of life shall have borne, \n
And Death with his sickle shall cut the ripe corn, \n
Resign'd to my fate, without murmur or sigh, \n
I'll bless the kind summons, and lie down and die. \n
Euphelia. \n
Thus sweetly pass the hours of rural ease! \n
Here life is bliss, and pleasures truly please! \n
Pastorella. \n
With joy we view the dangers we have past, \n
Assured we've found felicity at last. \n
Florella. \n
Esteem none happy by their outward air; \n
All have their portion of allotted care. \n
Though Wisdom wear the semblance of Content, \n
When the full heart with agony is rent, \n
Secludes its anguish from the public view, \n
And by secluding, learns to conquer too; \n
Denied the fond indulgence to complain, \n
The aching heart its peace may best regain. \n
By love directed, and in mercy meant, \n
Are trials suffer'd, and afflictions sent; \n
To stem impetuous Passion's furious tide, \n
To curb the insolence of prosperous Pride, \n
To wean from earth, and bid our wishes soar \n
Where weary'd Virtue shall for refuge fly, \n
And every tear be wiped from every eye. \n
Cleora. \n
Listening to you, my heart can never cease \n
To reverence Virtue, and to sigh for peace. \n
Florella. \n
Know, e'en Urania, that accomplish'd fair, \n
Whose goodness makes her Heaven's peculiar care, \n
Though born to all that affluence can bestow, \n
Has felt the deep reverse of human wo; \n
Yet meek in grief, and patient in distress, \n
She knew the hand that wounds has power to bless. \n
Grateful she bows, for what is left her still, \n
To Him whose love dispenses good and ill; \n
To Him who, while his bounty thousands fed, \n
Had not himself a place to lay his head; \n
To Him who, that he might our wealth insure, \n
Though rich himself, consented to be poor. \n
Taught by his precepts, by his practice taught \n
Her will submitted, and resigned her thought, \n
Through faith she looks beyond this dark abode, \n
To scenes of glory near the throne of God. \n
Enter Urania, Sylvia, Eliza. \n
Urania. \n
Since, gentle Nymphs, my friendship to obtain, \n
You've sought wth eager step this peaceful plain, \n
My honest counsel with attention hear, \n
Though plain, well meant; imperfect, yet sincere; \n
What from maturer years alone I've known, \n
What time has taught me and experience shown. \n
No polish'd phrase my artless speech will grace, \n
But unaffected candour fill its place: \n
My lips shall Flattery's smooth deceit refuse; \n
And truth be all the eloquence I'll use. \n
Know then, that life's chief happiness and wo, \n
From good or evil education flow; \n
And hence our future dispositions rise; \n
The vice we practise, or the good we prize. \n
When pliant nature any form receives, \n
That precept teaches or examples gives. \n
The yielding mind with virtue should be graced, \n
For first impressions seldom are effaced. \n
Then holy habits, then chastised desires, \n
Should regulate disorder'd Nature's fires. \n
If Ignorance then, her iron sway maintain, \n
If Prejudice preside, or Passion reign, \n
If Vanity preserve her native sway, \n
If selfish tempers cloud the opening day, \n
If no kind hand impetuous pride restrain, \n
But for the wholesome curb we give the rein; \n
The erring principle is rooted fast, \n
And fix'd the habit that through life may last. \n
Pastorella. \n
With heartfelt penitence we now deplore \n
Those squander'd hours, which time can ne'er restore. \n
Urania. \n
Euphelia sighs for flattery, dress, and show; \n
Too common sources these of female wo! \n
In Beauty's sphere pre-eminence to find, \n
She slights the culture of th' immortal mind: \n
I would not rail at Beauty's charming power, \n
I would but have her aim at something more; \n
The fairest symmetry of form or face, \n
From intellect receives its highest grace; \n
The brightest eyes ne'er dart such piercing fires \n
As when a soul irradiates and inspires. \n
Beauty with reason needs not quite dispense, \n
And coral lips may sure speak common sense; \n
Beauty makes Virtue lovelier still appear: \n
Virtue makes Beauty more divinely fair! \n
Confirms its conquests o'er the willing mind, \n
And those your beauties gain, your virtues bind. \n
Yet would Ambition's fire your bosom fill, \n
Its flames repress not -- be ambitious still; \n
Let nobler views your best attention claim, \n
The object changed, the engergy the same; \n
Those very passions which our heart invade, \n
If rightly pointed, blessings may be made. \n
Indulge the truth ambition to excel \n
In that best art -- the art of living well. \n
But first extirpate from your youthful breast \n
That rankling torment which destroys your rest: \n
All other faults may take a higher aim, \n
But hopeless Envy must be still the same. \n
Some other passions may be turn'd to good, \n
But Envy must subdue, or be subdued. \n
This fatal gangrene to our moral life, \n
Rejects all palliatives, and asks the knife: \n
Excision spared, it tains the vital part, \n
And spreads its deadly venom to the heart. \n
Euphelia. \n
Unhappy those to bliss who seek the way, \n
In power superior, or in splendour gay! \n
Inform'd by thee, no more vain man shall find \n
The charm of flattery taint Euphelia's mind: \n
By thee instructed, still my views shall rise, \n
Nor stop at any mark beneath the skies. \n
Urania. \n
In fair Laurinda's uninstructed mind, \n
The want of culture, not of sense, we find: \n
Whene'er you sought the good, or shunn'd the ill, \n
'Twas more from temper than from principle; \n
Your random life to no just rules reduced, \n
'Twas chance the virtue of the vice produced. \n
The casual goodness Impulse has to boast, \n
Like morning dews, or transient showers is lost \n
While Heaven-taught virtue pours her constant tide, \n
Like streams by living fountains still supplied. \n
Be wisdom still, though late, your earnest care, \n
Nor waste the precious hours in vain despair: \n
Associate with the good, attend the sage, \n
And meekly listen to experienced age. \n
What, if acquirements you have fail'd to gain \n
Such as the wise may want, the bad attain; \n
Yet still Religion's sacred treasures lie \n
Inviting, open, plain to every eye. \n
For every age, for every genius fit, \n
Nor limited to science nor to wit; \n
Not bound by taste, to genius not confined, \n
But all may learn the truths for all designed. \n
Though low the talents, and th' acquirements small, \n
The gift of grace divine is free to all; \n
She calls, solicits, courts you to be blest, \n
And points to mansions of eternal rest. \n
And when, advanced in years, matured in sense, \n
Think not with further care you may dispense; \n
'Tis fatal to the interests of the soul \n
To stop the race before we've reach'd the goal; \n
For nought our higher progress can preclude \n
So much as thinking we're already good. \n
The human heart ne'er knows a state of rest, \n
Bad leads to worse, and better tends to best. \n
We either gain or lose, we sink or rise, \n
Nor rests our struggling nature till she dies; \n
Then place the standard of Perfection high, \n
Pursue and grasp it, e'en beyond the sky. \n
Laurinda. \n
O that important Time could back return \n
Those mis-spent hours whose loss I deeply mourn \n
Accept, just Heaven, my penitence sincere, \n
My heartfelt anguish, and my fervant prayer! \n
Urania. \n
I pity Pastorella's hapless fate, \n
By nature gentle, generous, mild and great: \n
One false propension all her powers confined, \n
And chain'd her finer faculties of mind; \n
Yet every virtue might have flourish'd there \n
With early culture and maternal care. \n
If good we plant not, Vice will fill the place, \n
And rankest weeds the richest soils deface. \n
Learn, how ungovern'd thoughts the mind pervert, \n
And to disease all nourishment convert. \n
Ah! happy she, whose wisdom learns to find \n
A healthful fancy, and a well-train'd mind! \n
A sick man's wildest dreams less wild are found \n
Than the day-visions of a mind unsound. \n
Disorder'd phantasies indulged too much, \n
Like harpies, always taint whate'er they touch. \n
Fly soothing Solitude! fly vain Desire! \n
Fly such soft verse as fans the dangerous fire! \n
Seek action; 'tis the scene which virtue loves: \n
The vigorous sun not only shines, but moves. \n
From sickly thoughts with quick abhorrence start, \n
And rule the fancy if you'd rule the heart: \n
By active goodness, by laborious schemes, \n
Subdue wild visions, and delusive dreams. \n
No earthly good a Christian's views should bound, \n
For ever rising should his aims be found. \n
Leave that fictitious good your fancy feigns \n
For scenes where real bliss eternal reigns: \n
Look to that region of immortal joys, \n
Where fear disturbs not, nor possession cloys; \n
Beyond what Fancy forms of rosy bowers, \n
Or blooming chaplets of unfading flowers; \n
Fairer than e'er imagination drew, \n
Or poet's warmest visions ever knew. \n
Press eager onward to those blissful plains \n
Where life eternal, joy perpetual reigns. \n
Pastorella. \n
I mourn the errors of my thoughtless youth, \n
And long, with thee, to tread the paths of truth. \n
Urania. \n
Learning is all the bright Cleora's aim; \n
She seeks the loftiest pinnacle of fame; \n
On interdicted ground presumes to stand, \n
And grasps at Science with a venturous hand; \n
The privilege of Man she dares invade, \n
And tears the chaplet from his laurel'd head. \n
Why found her merit on a foreign claim? \n
Why lose a substance to acquire a name? \n
Let the proud sex possess their vaunted powers; \n
Be other triumphs, other glories, ours! \n
The gentler charms which wait on female life, \n
Which grace the daughter and adorn the wife, \n
Be these our boast; yet these may well admit \n
Of various knowledge, and of blameless wit; \n
Of sense, resulting from a nurtured mind, \n
Of polish'd converse, and of taste refined: \n
Of that quick intuition of the best, \n
Which feels the graceful, and rejects the rest: \n
Which finds the right by shorter ways than rules: \n
An art which Nature teaches -- not the schools. \n
Thus conquering Sevigne the heart obtains, \n
While Dacier only admiration gains. \n
Know, fair Aspirer, could you even hope \n
To speak like Stonehouse, or to write like Pope, \n
To all the wonders of the Poet's lyre, \n
Join all that taste can add, or wit inspire, \n
With every various power of learning fraught, \n
The flow of style and the sublime of thought; \n
Yet if the milder graces of the mind, \n
Graces peculiar to the sex design'd, \n
Good nature, patience, sweetness void of art; \n
If these embellish'd not your virgin heart, \n
You might be dazzling, but not truly bright; \n
Might glare, but not emit an useful light; \n
A meteor, not a star, you would appear; \n
For Woman shines but in her proper shpere. \n
Accomplishments by Heaven were sure designed, \n
Less to adorn than to amend the mind: \n
Each should contribute to this general end, \n
And all to virtue, as their centre, tend. \n
Th' acquirements, which our best esteem invite, \n
Should not project, but soften, mix, unite: \n
In glaring light not strongly be display'd, \n
But sweetly lost, and melted into shade. \n
Cleora. \n
Confused with shame, to thy reproofs I bend, \n
Thou best adviser, and thou truest friend! \n
From thee I'll learn to judge and act aright, \n
Humility with Knowledge to unite: \n
The finish'd character must both combine, \n
The perfect woman must in either shine. \n
Urania. \n
Florella shines adorn'd with every grace, \n
Her heart all virtue, as all charms her face: \n
Above the wretched, and below the great, \n
Kind Heaven has fix'd her in a middle state; \n
The demon Fashion never warp'd her soul, \n
Her passions move at Piety's control; \n
Her eyes the movements of her heart declare, \n
For what she dares to be, she dares appear; \n
Unlectured in Dissimulation's school, \n
To smile by precept, and to blush by rule, \n
Her thoughts ingenuous, ever open lie, \n
Nor shrink from close Inspection's keenest eye; \n
No dark disguise about her heart is thrown; \n
'Tis Virtue's interest fully to be known; \n
Her natural sweetness every heart obtains; \n
What Art and Affectation miss, she gains. \n
She smooths the path of my declining years, \n
Augments my comforts, and divides my cares. \n
Pastorella. \n
O sacred Friendship! O exalted state! \n
The choicest bounty of indulgent fate! \n
Urania. \n
Let Woman then her real good discern, \n
And her true interests of Urania learn: \n
As some fair violet, loveliest of the glade, \n
Sheds its mild fragrance on the lonely shade, \n
Withdraws its modest head from public sight, \n
Nor courts the Sun, nor seeks the glare of light; \n
Should some rude hand profanely dare intrude, \n
And bear its beauties from its native wood, \n
Exposed abroad its languid colours fly, \n
Its form decays, and all its odours die; \n
So Woman born to dignify retreat, \n
Unknown to flourish, and unseen be great, \n
To give domestic life its sweetest charm, \n
With softness polish, and with virtue warm, \n
Fearful of Fame, unwilling to be known, \n
Should seek but Heaven's applauses and her own; \n
Hers be the task to seek the lonely cell \n
Where modest want and silent anguish dwell: \n
Raise the weak head, sustain the feeble knees, \n
Cheer the cold heart, and chase the dire disease. \n
The splendid deeds which only seek a name, \n
Are paid their just reward in present fame; \n
But know, the awful all-disclosing day, \n
The long arrear of secret worth shall pay; \n
Applauding Saints shall hear with fond regard, \n
And He, who witness'd here, shall there reward. \n
Euphelia. \n
With added grace she pleads Religion's cause, \n
Who from her life her virtuous lesson draws. \n
Urania. \n
In vain, ye fair, from place to place you roam \n
For that true peace which must be found at home \n
Nor change of fortune, nor of scene can give \n
The bliss you seek, which in the soul must live. \n
Then look no more abroad; in your own breast \n
Seek the true seat of happiness and rest. \n
Nor small, my friends! the vigilance I ask; \n
Watch well yourselves, this is the Christian's task. \n
The cherish'd sin by each must be assail'd, \n
New efforts added, where the past have fail'd; \n
The darling error check'd, the will subdued, \n
The heart by penitence and pray'r renew'd. \n
Nor hope for perfect happiness below; \n
Celestial plants on earth reluctant grow: \n
He who our frail mortality did bear, \n
Though free from sin was not exempt from care. \n
Cleora. \n
Let's join to bless that Power who brought us here, \n
Adore his goodness, and his will revere; \n
Assured that Peace exists but in the mind, \n
And Piety alone that Peace can find. \n
Urania. \n
In its true light this transient life regard: \n
This is a state of trial, not reward. \n
Though rough the passage, peaceful is the port, \n
The bliss is perfect, the probation short. \n
Of human wit beware the fatal pride; \n
An useful follower, but a dangerous guide: \n
On holy Faith's aspiring pinions rise; \n
Assert your birth-right, and assume the skies. \n
Fountain of Being! teach us to devote \n
To Thee each purpose, action, word, and thought! \n
Thy grace our hope, thy love our only boast, \n
Be all distinction in the Christian lost! \n
Be this in every state our wish alone, \n
Almighty, Wise and Good, Thy will be done! \n<|endoftext|>

Dear Amarillis! MON. Hark! SIL. Mark! MIRT. This \n
earth grew sweet \n
Where, Amarillis, thou didst set thy feet. \n
AMBO Poor pitied youth! MIRT. And here the breath \n
of kine \n
And sheep grew more sweet by that breath of thine. \n
This dock of wool, and this rich lock of hair, \n
This ball of cowslips, these she gave me here. \n
SIL. Words sweet as love itself. MON. Hark!-- \n
MIRT. This way she came, and this way too she went; \n
How each thing smells divinely redolent! \n
Like to a field of beans, when newly blown, \n
Or like a meadow being lately mown. \n
MON. A sweet sad passion---- \n
MIRT. In dewy mornings, when she came this way, \n
Sweet bents would bow, to give my Love the day; \n
And when at night she folded had her sheep, \n
Daisies would shut, and closing, sigh and weep. \n
Besides (Ai me!) since she went hence to dwell, \n
The Voice's Daughter ne'er spake syllable. \n
But she is gone. SIL. Mirtillo, tell us whither? \n
MIRT. Where she and I shall never meet together. \n
MON. Fore-fend it, Pan! and Pales, do thou please \n
To give an end... MIRT. To what? SIL. Such griefs \n
as these. \n
MIRT. Never, O never! Still I may endure \n
The wound I suffer, never find a cure. \n
MON. Love, for thy sake, will bring her to these hills \n
And dales again. MIRT. No, I will languish still; \n
And all the while my part shall be to weep; \n
And with my sighs call home my bleating sheep; \n
And in the rind of every comely tree \n
I'll carve thy name, and in that name kiss thee. \n
MON. Set with the sun, thy woes! SIL. The day \n
grows old; \n
And time it is our full-fed flocks to fold. \n
CHOR. The shades grow great; but greater grows \n
our sorrow:-- \n
But let's go steep \n

And meet to weep \n

Parched gates guard the entrance to your being, \n

I'm supposed to die or leave here most quietly; \n
Never to disturb, the angels of the house; \n
You treat friendship so unseemly and unsightly, \n
My state's reduced, to lower than a mouse. \n
I wish I knew the octave of my error; \n

Anything to fix it, if only I still could. \n<|endoftext|>

draw funny faces, are in bliss again and again, \n

You ask that I must again turn back with a gesture, \n

where you do expect that I have got to forget everything, \n
must come and face a similar lifelong barrage, \n
where I know of the breaking down of my humanity: \n
that your people do not even respect or regard me as a human being, \n
where you did bring about and speak out the end of our relationship \n
and then it was with you and your people's deeds night to me, \n

free-verse \n
On a fine morning, she died \n
–like in the chick flicks, and ‘don’t-know-how-to-end-it’ romance novels. \n
Like her, It was a rare disease that took her by surprise, \n
It wasn’t her choice – it would never be \n
had she had the chance. \n
This was her first and only time she fought and lost a fight. \n
‘cause she always got what she asked for – even in love, \n
Her eyes were the first to sparkle, and ask and that’s how it started between us. \n
I wouldn’t lie –Looks did play a part – she was gorgeous, and after we fell in love, \n
She was the most gorgeous woman in the world – even when she was laid to rest. \n
We began to talk all the world we knew, \n
and with surprisingly’ Born & Lost & found again’ twin- like qualities, \n
we both regretted that we had lost a hell lot of time - \n
From the cradle itself – and we had to make up for all of it \n
And spend every moment we got –together. \n
She: 'Are we silly? ' Me: 'No, We are beautiful people! ' \n
We had made, lots of plans – \n
Unspoken and yet we both knew. \n
‘cause we believed in dream lands and Wuthering Heights \n
Ancient Classics on the radio, poetry, Victorian novels and less television, \n
More moments together in silence, deeply smitten; \n
In all, we wanted ours to be, the best love story ever written. \n
We bought little gifts from whatever change we had in our pockets, \n
Strange items from the 1$ store –an Angel made in China \n
– targeted at us types – sold, accepted with a smile; \n
musical greeting cards –which got me my first kiss, \n
and I started to give her a card every day; \n
and roses that were always not fragrant or fresh enough. \n
Remember Love letters? – There was always something to write, \n
exclusively handwritten with a fountain ink pen on paper – folded, \n
posted into a large red box called the post-box; \n
and we waited in thrill to read our letters that reached us a day later... \n
–we had all the time of our lives. \n
We were both often tongue-tied to say anything at all \n
after a ‘hello’ on the phone. \n
Her voice did that to me, \n
and she claimed that my boorish grumble did that to her as well. \n
And..there was getting drenched in the drizzle... \n
–blame our books if you want to, we wouldn’t; \n
Our Picnics in the meadows, home made cookies (her mom made them) , \n
Sipping green tea and watching the clouds pass by. \n
As time flew and we noticed, \n
we now talked about the right time to get together- \n
To turn the house i owned into our ideal home - that’s thankfully hard to locate \n
by our ‘convenience, cash-borrowing sake’ friends; \n
‘Cause we were selfish, and we wanted each other for several more years. \n
In a so called modern world where everything and anything old worldy \n
was not in anymore, \n
We laughed at the diabetes epidemic that infected the cultured minds, \n
And we happily indulged in the sickeningly sweet ways; \n
-We didn’t give a damnation. “Jealousy! ” She remarked. I agreed. \n
We spoke the same words; and rarely thought or talked differently, \n
‘Cause - She was me and I was She. \n
In all, the ‘uncool and unreal’ stuff on hallmark channel \n
–suspended reality of today based on Lost values, Frozen in time \n
and Memory (again, an old line) - \n
We believed in the old fashioned thing called Love. - Pity you! \n
After her death, it was like the end of times, \n
like in the books; \n
Birds sang sad songs; \n
The little squirrel that came down for bread crumbs waited for her \n
And left disappointed; the flowers drooped their heads in mourning for a few days \n
– so, It was all real! \n
I snapped out of it all, and brought the world back on its feet, \n
The world needs to go on, in spite of me. \n
The life that used to be for us and around us, came back to life. \n
As comforting words stopped from friends; \n
I continue to live with her- her memory, \n
And I begin to build the dream home we wanted \n
Slowly she started to appear, \n
No apparition, or ghoul or ghost - but actually her \n
As she quietly watched and smiled, and was all around when our home \n
Came to life. \n
The chrysanthemums and tulips for the garden; \n
Bird baths and bird houses; \n
A French window that opened into the woods; \n
No electric fencing ‘cause it’s dangerous for the animals; \n
No bloody television – the outside world doesn’t change for good in 24 hours, \n
and the morning paper was enough; \n
Ah.. the fireplace – the moments we shared, just looking deep into the fire \n
In deep embrace, feeling the warmth and our hearts beating together \n
To the sounds of wood splinter and crackle – i retained the fireplace as it was. \n
She wanted her own black beauty – a gorgeous stallion \n
and a pickup truck; our dreams grew on and we had to work harder - \n
to bring our picture post card aspirations to life. \n
A loan that will help take lease of the used books store in town and turn it into a library \n
- our humble idea to have a regular supply of titles. \n
We were always realistic in our world – believing, hoping and loving. \n
We could open the books and relive the stories again, \n
Dream the lost dreams-channels have re-runs, don’t they? \n
I got it all happening, God’s grace, \n
‘cause we would never like our dreams to fail, \n
while I still run the bakery – going on the same way. \n
The pastries are missing something – customer complaints \n
for which I know the answer \n
but cannot explain the ‘missing ingredient’ to them. \n
We never kept diaries, ‘cause we remembered whatever that mattered to us \n
and that was enough. \n
Her dreams, our dreams and our life was all that mattered – love mattered. \n
And that was enough. \n
Conversations happen now and then \n
with the people I occasionally bump into and \n
as usual, they talk as though they were always there to care – \n
Them: “Are you seeing someone again? You have to move on! ” \n
Me: “Sorry! Wherever I go, She goes.” \n
“I shan’t betray her memory! I feel her in the wind when I walk; \n
“I feel her, see her in everything I touch”; \n
I feel her comforting me, giving me company in my aloneness! ” \n
I would live and die as her beau! ” \n
Them: Frowns. “They were never in touch with reality! ” \n
“Thank you. For once we agree, I didnt believe in your reality.” \n
We never asked anyone to believe us or in what we believed in. \n
I continue to dream and build our home \n
-The fire had died out, but the warmth hasn’t. \n
The winds still carry her beautiful songs, \n
They might bring them back to me after every bird has learnt it. \n
I wake up in the morning, and look first at her face, \n
Her eyes closed in sleep, and the little smile on her face, \n
I can feel she’s still dreaming. \n
The books we really loved always ended \n
with ‘Then, they lived happily ever after.” \n
We are living, happily, ever after. \n<|endoftext|>

“Popular.” \n
Not necessary to fit in, \n

and there is a gambol, music and lights that drone and hum, \n
young people everywhere together do laugh happily and its dark night \n
and when a dark figure comes nearer and my heart skips a beat, \n
for danger I am ready and do expect the worst \n
but in a black leather jacket a much older man walks past \n
while the eternal longing for peace and tranquillity do remain in my heart. \n

Precambrian Era (4600 to 542.0 million years ago) \n
A permanent record of the Earth's past is marked by the \n
Boundaries of different layers of sedimentary rock which \n
Contains fossilized remains of plants and animals laid \n
Down over millions of years. Precambrian is the first of \n
Earth's geologic ages. The Precambrian age is by \n
Far the longest, starting 4.5 billion years ago. It is believed a \n
Global ice age was near its end causing extinctions of life that \n
Harnessed the sun's power through photosynthesis. This \n
Ice age may have may have changed the mix of a complex \n
Jackpot of multi-celled life-forms, with many that were \n
Killed off to start the Cambrian Period. \n
Levels of oxygen gradually climbed in the atmosphere from \n
Microscopic cyanobacteria, reaching about one percent \n
Nearly two billion years ago. About 800 million years ago, \n
Oxygen levels rose to about 21 percent (like today) by \n
Photosynthesis from the cyanobacteria. \n
Quests to find out about this period have shown that the oxygen- \n
Rich ozone layer was also established which \n
Shields the Earth from harmful solar radiation. \n
This laid the groundwork to \n
Usher in the Cambrian and the rest of the Paleozoic with their \n
Various life forms. \n
Cambrian Period (542.0 to 488.3 mya) \n
A dramatic burst of evolutionary changes in life on Earth \n
Became known as the 'Cambrian Explosion.' Some resembled \n
Clams, and there were arthropods and chordates (animals with a \n
Dorsal nerve cord) . This period lasted about 53 million years of \n
Earth's history. The end of this period is marked by evidence in the \n
Fossil record of a mass extinction event about 490 million years ago. \n
Glaciers and a colder climate may have been the cause. \n
Ordovician Period (488.3 to 443.7 mya) \n
Algae and sponges dominated reef ecosystems and sometimes by \n
Bryozoans. However, there apparently were also periods of \n
Complete reef collapse due to global disturbances. \n
Diverse marine life was here, including graptolites, trilobites and \n
Early vertebrates, and brachiopods. There were also primitive \n
Fish, cephalopods, corals, crinoids, and gastropods, plus red and \n
Green algae. Tetrahedral spores similar to those of primitive land plants \n
Have been found, suggesting that plants invaded the land at this time. \n
Invertebrate genera and 25% of all families went extinct. \n
Silurian Period (443.7 to 416.0 mya) \n
About 443.7 to 416.0 million years ago was a time when many \n
Biologically significant events occurred. In the oceans, there were \n
Crinoids spreading widely and proliferation of the brachiopods. \n
Deglaciation and rise in sea levels created many new marine habitats. \n
Erratic climatic fluctuations ended for a time and coral reefs made their \n
First appearance during this time. \n
Devonian Period (416.0 to 359.2 mya) \n
All through the Devonian period, the seas were dominated by \n
Brachiopods, such as the spiriferids, and by tabulate and rugose \n
Corals, which built large reefs in shallow waters. In the Lower \n
Devonian, ammonoids appeared, leaving us large limestone deposits. \n
Echinoderms, graptolites, bivalves and trilobites were all present. \n
Forests spread, and complex root systems may have altered the \n
Global climate. Whatever the cause, the first vertebrates \n
Hobbled onto the land. \n
Carboniferous Period (359.2 to 299.0 mya) \n
Attached filter feeders such as fenestellids, a common type of \n
Bryozoans, were abundant in this environment, as were brachiopods. \n
Clams made their first appearance in freshwater, and there was \n
Diversity in sharks and an increase in gastropod and bony fish. The \n
Environment supported fewer corals, crinoids, cryozoans, and bryzoans. \n
Fluctuations in sea level can be seen in the rocks as striped patterns from \n
Glaciation. Sea levels dropped, leading to an increase in terrestrial \n
Habitat. As the continents moved closer to forming Pangea, there was an \n
Increase of marine life in those shallow continental waters. \n
Permian Period (299.0 to 251.0 mya) \n
'Age of Dinosaurs' is what this period is called after a mass extinction. \n
Brachiopods, ammonoids, fusilinids, and other marine invertebrates, and \n
Conodonts fossils occur within such specific time frames that strata are \n
Determined by them and permit stratigraphic identification. In the \n
Early Permian, it appeared that the snapsids were to be the animals \n
Found most on land, but later on, the sauropsid group were most when the \n
'Great Dying' occurred. In as little as 100,000 years of Earth's \n
History, the majority of living species on the planet were wiped out. \n
Investigations showed evidence of catastrophic volcanic activity that \n
Justifiably would have initially caused rapid global cooling and \n
Killing of many species, and leading to increased glaciations. \n
Lowered sea levels and volcanic fallout would account for \n
Marine ecosystems in collapse due to much higher levels of CO2, \n
Not in the air, but in the oceans. \n
Triassic Period (251.0 to 199.6 mya) \n
At the beginning of the Triassic, land masses of the world were still \n
Bound together into the vast supercontinent known as Pangea. \n
Climate of the Triassic Period was influenced by Pangea. \n
Due to the low sea level, flooding of the continents did not occur. \n
Elevation of the continents were high compared to sea level. \n
Forests in Luarasia in beginning Triassic were dominated by conifers; \n
Gondwana was dominated by Dicroidium and Thinnfeldia. By the end, both \n
Hemispheres gave way to conifer and cycad vegetation. \n
Inevitably the climate changed as the continents drifted apart. \n
Jurassic Period (199.6 to 145.5 mya) \n
Apatosaurus and many other dinosaurs roamed the land in the Jurassic. \n
Brachiosaurus was another huge one. Small, fast bird-like coelurosaurs, \n
Ceratosaurs (horned reptiles) called Earth home. The famous \n
Diplodocus is a large long-necked Sauropod. Some plant life had \n
Evolved from Bryophytes, the mosses that lacked vascular tissue. \n
Floras were different from what we see today. Ferns, bennettitaleans, \n
Ginkgoes and cycads flourished in the Jurassic. Along with the large \n
Herbivores were some carnosaurs: Allosaurus and Tyrannosaurus rex. \n
Ichthyosaurus was a fish-shaped reptile in the sea. In August 2011, \n
Juramaia was discovered by scientists in China. This tiny animal is \n
Kinfolk to placental mammals, so has caused excitement. \n
Cretaceous Period (145.5 to 65.5 mya) \n
At the time of the Cretaceous, many modern groups of insects were \n
Beginning to diversify, and we find the oldest known ants and butterflies. \n
Ceratopsian and pachycepalosaurid dinosaurs appeared then. Some \n
Dinosaurs that learned to fly included the pterosaurs and Confuciusornis. \n
Extensive new coastlines came about from the continents moving apart. \n
Forests with oaks, hickories, and magnolias became common. \n
Grasshoppers and gall wasps appear, as well as termites and bees. \n
Half of the world's species went extinct about the time an asteroid hit. \n
Invertebrates became extinct in what was clearly a climatic event. \n
Eocene Epoch (55.8 to 33.9 mya) \n
An early horse ancestor, the dawn horse, is among the fossils found in \n
Both North America and Europe in the lower Eocene rocks. \n
Cattle and sheep are some of the artiodactyls fossils found. \n
Deer is another, and perissodactyls include rhinoceroses and tapirs. \n
Eocene Epoch marks the first appearance in the fossil record of the \n
First elephant-like animals and the early bats. There were whales and \n
Gastropods (a class of mollusks containing snails, slugs, and limpets) . \n
Oligocene Epoch (33.9 to 23.03 mya) \n
As a result of the cooling trend, habitats were directly affected. \n
Biotic provinces became more fragmented as sea dwellers \n
Capable of cooler temps went further from the warmer equator. \n
Deer, camel, elephants, cats, dogs, and primates began to dominate, \n
Except in Australia. Migration occurred between continents. \n
Falcons, eagles, hawks, and many families of rodents appeared. \n
Grasses and composites increased in abundance globally. \n
Horses experienced a period of diversification. \n
Miocene Epoch (23.03 to 5.332 mya) \n
Africa and Eurasia encountered significant tectonic movement. \n
Beginning in mid-Miocene, there was warming, followed by a \n
Cooling. It is considered responsible for diversification of plant life. \n
Desmostylia and other ocean-going mammals went extinct. \n
Eurasia and Australia grew increasingly arid. Europe kept its moist \n
Forests. Antarctica became isolated from the other continents. \n
Global ocean and atmospheric circulation were affected by that. \n
Hoofed mammals underwent a period of rapid evolution. \n
Pliocene Epoch (5.332 to 2.588 mya) \n
Asia's and India's tectonic plates collided, forming the Himalayas. \n
Basin ranges of Nevada and Utah were uplifted along with the \n
Colorado plateaus. Armadillo, opossum, and porcupines went north. \n
Dogs, cats, bears and horses migrated south. The beginning of the \n
Epoch saw numerous fluctuations in temperature. \n
Forests were replaced by grasslands. This favored grazing animals. \n
Generally the climate is thought to have been much warmer than today. \n
Hot times were replaced with cold and polar ice caps started to develop. \n
Pleistocene Epoch (2.588 mya to 11,700 ya) \n
Alternately, temperate zones were covered and uncovered by glaciers \n
Because of dramatically shifting climates and temperatures. \n
Camels and horses galloped across the plains of North America. \n
Diatoms, foraminifera, and plant pollen, were both abundant. \n
Ever larger land mammals appeared such as mammoths and mastodons. \n
Flowering plants, insects, mollusks, birds and mammals survive to this day. \n
Great teratorn birds with 25-foot wingspans stalked prey. \n
Homo sapiens came about, and humans spread through most of the world. \n
Holocene Epoch (11,700 years ago to today) \n
Another name for the Holocene is the Anthropogene, the 'Age of Man.' \n
By 8000 B.C., the cultivation of wheat, etc. had spread from the Fertile \n
Crescent through much of the Indo/European world. \n
Domestication of sheep, goats and cattle began at about the same time. \n
Extinction of the 'mega-mammals' caused Humans to switch to \n
Far smaller game and agriculture for their food supply. \n
Genetic modification of food started, and now is almost exclusive. \n
Habitat destruction is the leading cause of species extinction today. \n
Improved sanitation and medical care caused death rates to decline. \n
Judicial decisions against the death penalty further increased population. \n
Killing of police officers is increasing, while birth rates continue to climb. \n
Limiting factors in the environment provide natural balances to populations. \n
Monoculture has affected the composition and fertility of the soil. \n
Nuclear power has had some catastrophes, but is still an important tool. \n
Oil drilling and refinement have led to high migration of humans and pets. \n
Populations are rising with few restrictions, and are exponential. \n
Quakes in the earth are getting more frequent. Fracking is suspected. \n
Racial clashes around the world are a source of destruction and migration. \n
Species gone extinct in the Holocene are counted as at least 171. \n
Transportation across oceans has spread viruses and bacteria globally. \n
Uranium enrichment can be good, but can be the way to mass extinctions. \n
Virus mutations have led to super-viruses that are immune to antibiotics. \n
War has been the cause of mass migration, and smoke affecting climate. \n
X-rays save lives by alerting to medical problems that can be solved. \n<|endoftext|>

panegyric \n
[To my Lord Protector, of the Present Greatness, and Joint Interest, of His Highness, and this Nation.] \n
While with a strong and yet a gentle hand, \n
You bridle faction, and our hearts command, \n
Protect us from ourselves, and from the foe, \n
Make us unite, and make us conquer too; \n
Let partial spirits still aloud complain, \n
Think themselves injured that they cannot reign, \n
And own no liberty but where they may \n
Without control upon their fellows prey. \n
Above the waves as Neptune showed his face, \n
To chide the winds, and save the Trojan race, \n
So has your Highness, raised above the rest, \n
Storms of ambition, tossing us, repressed. \n
Your drooping country, torn with civil hate, \n
Restored by you, is made a glorious state; \n
The seat of empire, where the Irish come, \n
And the unwilling Scotch, to fetch their doom. \n
The sea's our own; and now all nations greet, \n
With bending sails, each vessel of our fleet; \n
Your power extends as far as winds can blow, \n
Or swelling sails upon the globe may go. \n
Heaven, (that has placed this island to give law, \n
To balance Europe, and her states to awe) \n
In this conjunction does on Britain smile; \n
The greatest leader, and the greatest isle! \n
Whether this portion of the world were rent, \n
By the rude ocean, from the continent; \n
Or thus created; it was sure designed \n
To be the sacred refuge of mankind. \n
Hither the oppressed shall henceforth resort, \n
Justice to crave, and succour, at your court; \n
And then your Highness, not for ours alone, \n
But for the world's protector shall be known. \n
Fame, swifter than your winged navy, flies \n
Through every land that near the ocean lies, \n
Sounding your name, and telling dreadful news \n
To all that piracy and rapine use. \n
With such a chief the meanest nation blessed, \n
Might hope to lift her head above the rest; \n
What may be thought impossible to do \n
For us, embraced by the sea and you? \n
Lords of the world's great waste, the ocean, we \n
Whole forests send to reign upon the sea, \n
And every coast may trouble, or relieve; \n
But none can visit us without your leave. \n
Angels and we have this prerogative, \n
That none can at our happy seat arrive; \n
While we descend at pleasure, to invade \n
The bad with vengeance, and the good to aid. \n
Our little world, the image of the great, \n
Like that, amidst the boundless ocean set, \n
Of her own growth has all that Nature craves; \n
And all that's rare, as tribute from the waves. \n
As Egypt does not on the clouds rely, \n
But to her Nile owes more than to the sky; \n
So what our earth, and what our heaven, denies, \n
Our ever constant friend, the sea, supplies. \n
The taste of hot Arabia's spice we know, \n
Free from the scorching sun that makes it grow; \n
Without the worm, in Persian silks we shine; \n
And, without planting, drink of every vine. \n
To dig for wealth we weary not our limbs; \n
Gold, though the heaviest metal, hither swims; \n
Ours is the harvest where the Indians mow; \n
We plough the deep, and reap what others sow. \n
Things of the noblest kind our own soil breeds; \n
Stout are our men, and warlike are our steeds; \n
Rome, though her eagle through the world had flown, \n
Could never make this island all her own. \n
Here the Third Edward, and the Black Prince, too, \n
France-conquering Henry flourished, and now you; \n
For whom we stayed, as did the Grecian state, \n
Till Alexander came to urge their fate. \n
When for more worlds the Macedonian cried, \n
He wist not Thetis in her lap did hide \n
Another yet; a world reserved for you, \n
To make more great than that he did subdue. \n
He safely might old troops to battle lead, \n
Against the unwarlike-Persian, and the Mede, \n
Whose hasty flight did, from the bloodless field, \n
More spoil than honour to the victor yield. \n
A race unconquered, by their clime made bold, \n
The Caledonians, armed with want and cold, \n
Have, by a fate indulgent to your fame, \n
Been from all ages kept for you to tame. \n
Whom the old Roman wall so ill confined, \n
With a new chain of garrisons you bind; \n
Here foreign gold no more shall make them come; \n
Our English iron holds them fast at home. \n
They, that henceforth must be content to know \n
No warmer region, than their hills of snow, \n
May blame the sun, but must extol your grace, \n
Which in our senate has allowed them place. \n
Preferred by conquest, happily o'erthrown, \n
Falling they rise, to be with us made one; \n
So kind dictators made, when they came home, \n
Their vanquished foes free citizens of Rome. \n
Like favour find the Irish, with like fate, \n
Advanced to be a portion of our state; \n
While by your valour and your courteous mind, \n
Nations, divided by the sea, are joined. \n
Holland, to gain your friendship, is content \n
To be our outguard on the continent; \n
She from her fellow-provinces would go, \n
Rather than hazard to have you her foe. \n
In our late fight, when cannons did diffuse, \n
Preventing posts, the terror and the news, \n
Our neighbour princes trembled at their roar; \n
But our conjunction makes them tremble more. \n
Your never-failing sword made war to cease; \n
And now you heal us with the arts of peace; \n
Our minds with bounty and with awe engage, \n
Invite affection, and restrain our rage. \n
Less pleasure take brave minds in battles won, \n
Than in restoring such as are undone; \n
Tigers have courage, and the rugged bear, \n
But man alone can, whom he conquers, spare. \n
To pardon willing, and to punish loath, \n
You strike with one hand, but you heal with both; \n
Lifting up all that prostrate lie, you grieve \n
You cannot make the dead again to live. \n
When fate, or error. had our age misled, \n
And o'er these nations such confusion spread, \n
The only cure, which could from Heaven come down, \n
Was so much power and clemency in one! \n
One! whose extraction from an ancient line \n
Gives hope again that well-born men may shine; \n
The meanest in your nature, mild and good, \n
The noble rest secured in your blood. \n
Oft have we wondered how you hid in peace \n
A mind proportioned to such things as these; \n
How such a ruling spirit you could restrain, \n
And practise first over yourself to reign. \n
Your private life did a just pattern give, \n
How fathers, husbands, pious sons should live; \n
Born to command, your princely virtues slept, \n
Like humble David's, while the flock he kept. \n
But when your troubled country called you forth, \n
Your flaming courage, and your matchless worth, \n
Dazzling the eyes of all that did pretend, \n
To fierce contention gave a prosperous end. \n
Still as you rise, the state, exalted too, \n
Finds no distemper while 'tis changed by you; \n
Changed like the world's great scene! when, without noise, \n
The rising sun night's vulgar light destroys. \n
Had you, some ages past, this race of glory \n
Run, with amazement we should read your story; \n
But living virtue, all achievements past, \n
Meets envy still, to grapple with at last. \n
This Cæsar found; and that ungrateful age, \n
With losing him fell back to blood and rage; \n
Mistaken Brutus thought to break their yoke, \n
But cut the bond of union with that stroke. \n
That sun once set, a thousand meaner stars \n
Gave a dim light to violence, and wars, \n
To such a tempest as now threatens all, \n
Did not your mighty arm prevent the fall. \n
If Rome's great senate could not wield that sword, \n
Which of the conquered world had made them lord, \n
What hope had ours, while yet their power was new, \n
To rule victorious armies, but by you? \n
You! that had taught them to subdue their foes, \n
Could order teach, and their high spirits compose; \n
To every duty could their minds engage, \n
Provoke their courage, and command their rage. \n
So when a lion shakes his dreadful mane, \n
And angry grows, if he that first took pain \n
To tame his youth approach the haughty beast, \n
He bends to him, but frights away the rest. \n
As the vexed world, to find repose, at last \n
Itself into Augustus' arms did cast; \n
So England now does, with like toil oppressed, \n
Her weary head upon your bosom rest. \n
Then let the Muses, with such notes as these, \n
Instruct us what belongs unto our peace; \n
Your battles they hereafter shall indite, \n
And draw the image of our Mars in fight; \n
Tell of towns stormed, or armies overrun, \n
And mighty kingdoms by your conduct won; \n
How, while you thundered, clouds of dust did choke \n
Contending troops, and seas lay hid in smoke. \n
Illustrious acts high raptures do infuse, \n
And every conqueror creates a muse. \n
Here, in low strains, your milder deeds we sing; \n
But there, my lord; we'll bays and olive bring \n
To crown your head; while you in triumph ride \n
O'er vanquished nations, and the sea beside; \n
While all your neighbour-princes unto you, \n
Like Joseph's sheaves, pay reverence, and bow. \n<|endoftext|>

Come hither, gently rowing, \n
Come, bear me quickly o'er \n
This stream so brightly flowing \n
To yonder woodland shore. \n
But vain were my endeavour \n
To pay thee, courteous guide; \n
Row on, row on, for ever \n
I'd have thee by my side. \n
Good boatman, prithee haste thee, \n
I seek my father-land. -- \n
Say, when I there have placed thee, \n
Dare I demand thy hand? \n
A maiden's head can never \n
So hard a point decide; \n
Row on, row on, for ever \n
I'd have thee by my side. \n
The happy bridal over \n
The wanderer ceased to roam, \n
For, seated by her lover, \n
The boat became her home. \n
And they still sang together \n
As steering o'er the tide: \n
Row on through wind and weather \n
For ever by my side. \n<|endoftext|>
ballad \n
We had slaughtered a hundred white whales, \n
civilization was quite forgotten, \n
our lungs were burned out from smoking shag, \n
but on sighting port we blew out our chests like barrels \n
and began to speak to one another politely, \n
and with the noble goal of drinking \n
we went ashore from the schooner at Amderma. \n
In Amderma we walked like gods, \n
swaggering along with our hands on our hips, \n
and through the port our beards and sidewhiskers \n
kept their bearings on the pub, \n
and passing girls and shellbacks \n
as well as all the local dogs \n
went along with us as escort. \n
But, clouding the whole planet, \n
a notice hung in the shop: 'No Spirits! ' \n
We looked at some sparkling wine from the Don \n
as if it were feeble fruit juice, \n
and through our agonized yearning \n
we realized-it wouldn't work. \n
Now who could have drunk our spirits, our vodka? \n
It's dreadful the way people drink-simply ruinous. \n
But skinny as a skeleton, Petka Markovsky from Odessa, \n
as it always happens with him, \n
suddenly disappeared somewhere \n
giving a secretive 'Sh-sshh! ' \n
And shortly afterward, with much clinking, \n
he turned up with a huge cardboard box, \n
already slightly merry, \n
and it was a sweet clinking the box made \n
as we woke up to the fact: 'There she is! She's apples! ' \n
and Markovsky gave us the wink: 'She's right! ' \n
We made a splash, waving to everyone- \n
Chartered a deluxe room in the hotel \n
and sat down as we were on the bed. \n
Cords flew off the box \n
and there, in the glittering columns of the bottles, \n
bulging, stern, cosy, \n
absolutely hygienic- \n
triple-distilled eau de cologne stood before us! \n
And Markovsky rose, lifting his glass, \n
pulled down his seaman's jacket, \n
and began: 'I'd like to say something...' \n
'Then say it! ' everyone began to shout. \n
But before anything else \n
they wanted to wet their whistles. \n
Markovsky said: 'Come on-let's have a swig! \n
The doctor told me eau de cologne \n
is the best thing to keep the wrinkles away. \n
Let them judge us! -We don't give a damn! \n
We used to drink all sorts of wine! \n
When we were in Germany \n
we filled the radiators of our tanks \n
with wine from the Mosel. \n
We don't need consumer goods! \n
We need the wind, the sky! \n
Old mates, listen to this \n
in our souls, as though in the safe deposit: \n
We have the sea, our mothers and young brothers- \n
All the rest...is rubbish! ' \n
Bestriding the earth like a giant, \n
Markovsky stood with a glass in his hand \n
that held the foaming seas. \n
The skipper observed: 'Everything is shipshape! ' \n
and only the boatswain sobbed like a child: \n
'But my mother is dead...' \n
And we all began to burst into tears, \n
quite easily, quite shamelessly, \n
as if in the midst of our own families, \n
mourning with bitter tears \n
at first for the boatswain's mother, \n
and afterward simply for ourselves. \n
Already a rueful notice hung in the chemist's shop- \n
'No Triple Eau de Cologne'- \n
but eight of us sea wolves \n
sobbed over almost all of Russia! \n
And in our sobs we reeked \n
like eight barbershops. \n
Tears, like squalls, \n
swept away heaps of false values, \n
of puffed-up names, \n
and quietly remaining inside us \n
was only the sea, our mothers and young brothers- \n
even the mother who was dead... \n
I wept as though I was being set free, \n
I wept as if I was being born anew, \n
a different person from what I'd been, \n
and before God and before myself, \n
like the tears of those drunken whalemen, \n
my soul was pure. \n<|endoftext|>
ballad \n
This is the story of G.R.D., \n
Who went on a mission across the sea \n
To borrow some money for you and me. \n
This G. R. Dibbs was a stalwart man \n
Who was built on a most extensive plan, \n
And a regular staunch Republican. \n
But he fell in the hands of the Tory crew \n
Who said, "It's a shame that a man like you \n
Should teach Australia this nasty view. \n
"From her mother's side she should ne'er be gone, \n
And she ought to be glad to be smiled upon, \n
And proud to be known as our hanger-on." \n
And G. R. Dibbs, he went off his peg \n
At the swells who came for his smiles to beg \n
And the Prince of Wales -- who was pulling his leg \n
And he told them all when the wine had flown, \n
"The Australian has got no land of his own, \n
His home is England, and there alone." \n
So he strutted along with the titled band \n
And he sold the pride of his native land \n
For a bow and a smile and a shake of the hand. \n
And the Tory drummers they sit and call: \n
"Send over your leaders great and small; \n
For the price is low, and we'll buy them all \n
"With a tinsel title, a tawdry star \n
Of a lower grade than our titles are, \n
And a puff at a prince's big cigar." \n
And the Tories laugh till they crack their ribs \n
When they think how they purchased G. R. Dibbs. \n<|endoftext|>
ballad \n
The end of the affair is always death. \n
She's my workshop. Slippery eye, \n
out of the tribe of myself my breath \n
finds you gone. I horrify \n
those who stand by. I am fed. \n
At night, alone, I marry the bed. \n
Finger to finger, now she's mine. \n
She's not too far. She's my encounter. \n
I beat her like a bell. I recline \n
in the bower where you used to mount her. \n
You borrowed me on the flowered spread. \n
At night, alone, I marry the bed. \n
Take for instance this night, my love, \n
that every single couple puts together \n
with a joint overturning, beneath, above, \n
the abundant two on sponge and feather, \n
kneeling and pushing, head to head. \n
At night, alone, I marry the bed. \n
I break out of my body this way, \n
an annoying miracle. Could I \n
put the dream market on display? \n
I am spread out. I crucify. \n
My little plum is what you said. \n
At night, alone, I marry the bed. \n
Then my black-eyed rival came. \n
The lady of water, rising on the beach, \n
a piano at her fingertips, shame \n
on her lips and a flute's speech. \n
And I was the knock-kneed broom instead. \n
At night, alone, I marry the bed. \n
She took you the way a women takes \n
a bargain dress off the rack \n
and I broke the way a stone breaks. \n
I give back your books and fishing tack. \n
Today's paper says that you are wed. \n
At night, alone, I marry the bed. \n
The boys and girls are one tonight. \n
They unbutton blouses. They unzip flies. \n
They take off shoes. They turn off the light. \n
The glimmering creatures are full of lies. \n
They are eating each other. They are overfed. \n
At night, alone, I marry the bed. \n<|endoftext|>

"Son," said my mother, \n
When I was knee-high, \n
"you've need of clothes to cover you, \n
and not a rag have I. \n

And she began to cry. \n
That was in the early fall. \n
When came the late fall, \n
"Son," she said, "the sight of you \n
Makes your mother's blood crawl,— \n
"Little skinny shoulder-blades \n
Sticking through your clothes! \n
And where you'll get a jacket from \n
God above knows. \n
"It's lucky for me, lad, \n
Your daddy's in the ground, \n
And can't see the way I let \n
His son go around!" \n
And she made a queer sound. \n
That was in the late fall. \n
When the winter came, \n
I'd not a pair of breeches \n
Nor a shirt to my name. \n
I couldn't go to school, \n
Or out of doors to play. \n
And all the other little boys \n
Passed our way. \n
"Son," said my mother, \n
"Come, climb into my lap, \n
And I'll chafe your little bones \n
While you take a nap." \n
And, oh, but we were silly \n
For half and hour or more, \n
Me with my long legs, \n
Dragging on the floor, \n
A-rock-rock-rocking \n
To a mother-goose rhyme! \n
Oh, but we were happy \n
For half an hour's time! \n
But there was I, a great boy, \n
And what would folks say \n
To hear my mother singing me \n
To sleep all day, \n
In such a daft way? \n
Men say the winter \n
Was bad that year; \n
Fuel was scarce, \n
And food was dear. \n
A wind with a wolf's head \n
Howled about our door, \n
And we burned up the chairs \n
And sat upon the floor. \n
All that was left us \n
Was a chair we couldn't break, \n
And the harp with a woman's head \n
Nobody would take, \n
For song or pity's sake. \n
The night before Christmas \n
I cried with cold, \n
I cried myself to sleep \n
Like a two-year old. \n
And in the deep night \n
I felt my mother rise, \n
And stare down upon me \n
With love in her eyes. \n
I saw my mother sitting \n
On the one good chair, \n
A light falling on her \n
From I couldn't tell where. \n
Looking nineteen, \n
And not a day older, \n
And the harp with a woman's head \n
Leaned against her shoulder. \n
Her thin fingers, moving \n
In the thin, tall strings, \n
Were weav-weav-weaving \n
Wonderful things. \n
Many bright threads, \n
From where I couldn't see, \n
Were running through the harp-strings \n
Rapidly, \n
And gold threads whistling \n
Through my mother's hand. \n
I saw the web grow, \n
And the pattern expand. \n
She wove a child's jacket, \n
And when it was done \n
She laid it on the floor \n
And wove another one. \n
She wove a red cloak \n
So regal to see, \n
"She's made it for a king's son," \n
I said, "and not for me." \n
But I knew it was for me. \n
She wove a pair of breeches \n
Quicker than that! \n
She wove a pair of boots \n
And a little cocked hat. \n
She wove a pair of mittens, \n
Shw wove a little blouse, \n
She wove all night \n
In the still, cold house. \n
She sang as she worked, \n
And the harp-strings spoke; \n
Her voice never faltered, \n
And the thread never broke, \n
And when I awoke,— \n
There sat my mother \n
With the harp against her shoulder, \n
Looking nineteeen, \n
And not a day older, \n
A smile about her lips, \n
And a light about her head, \n
And her hands in the harp-strings \n
Frozen dead. \n
And piled beside her \n
And toppling to the skies, \n
Were the clothes of a king's son, \n
Just my size. \n<|endoftext|>
ballad \n
Version II \n
He did not wear his scarlet coat, \n
For blood and wine are red, \n
And blood and wine were on his hands \n
When they found him with the dead, \n
The poor dead woman whom he loved, \n
And murdered in her bed. \n
He walked amongst the Trial Men \n
In a suit of shabby gray; \n
A cricket cap was on his head, \n
And his step seemed light and gay; \n
But I never saw a man who looked \n
So wistfully at the day. \n
I never saw a man who looked \n
With such a wistful eye \n
Upon that little tent of blue \n
Which prisoners call the sky, \n
And at every drifting cloud that went \n
With sails of silver by. \n
I walked, with other souls in pain, \n
Within another ring, \n
And was wondering if the man had done \n
A great or little thing, \n
When a voice behind me whispered low, \n
'That fellow's got to swing.' \n
Dear Christ! the very prison walls \n
Suddenly seemed to reel, \n
And the sky above my head became \n
Like a casque of scorching steel; \n
And, though I was a soul in pain, \n
My pain I could not feel. \n
I only knew what haunted thought \n
Quickened his step, and why \n
He looked upon the garish day \n
With such a wistful eye; \n
The man had killed the thing he loved, \n
And so he had to die. \n
Yet each man kills the thing he loves, \n
By each let this be heard, \n
Some do it with a bitter look, \n
Some with a flattering word, \n
The coward does it with a kiss, \n
The brave man with a sword! \n
Some kill their love when they are young, \n
And some when they are old; \n
Some strangle with the hands of Lust, \n
Some with the hands of Gold: \n
The kindest use a knife, because \n
The dead so soon grow cold. \n
Some love too little, some too long, \n
Some sell, and others buy; \n
Some do the deed with many tears, \n
And some without a sigh: \n
For each man kills the thing he loves, \n
Yet each man does not die. \n
He does not die a death of shame \n
On a day of dark disgrace, \n
Nor have a noose about his neck, \n
Nor a cloth upon his face, \n
Nor drop feet foremost through the floor \n
Into an empty space. \n
He does not sit with silent men \n
Who watch him night and day; \n
Who watch him when he tries to weep, \n
And when he tries to pray; \n
Who watch him lest himself should rob \n
The prison of its prey. \n
He does not wake at dawn to see \n
Dread figures throng his room, \n
The shivering Chaplain robed in white, \n
The Sheriff stern with gloom, \n
And the Governor all in shiny black, \n
With the yellow face of Doom. \n
He does not rise in piteous haste \n
To put on convict-clothes, \n
While some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats, and notes \n
Each new and nerve-twitched pose, \n
Fingering a watch whose little ticks \n
Are like horrible hammer-blows. \n
He does not feel that sickening thirst \n
That sands one's throat, before \n
The hangman with his gardener's gloves \n
Comes through the padded door, \n
And binds one with three leathern thongs, \n
That the throat may thirst no more. \n
He does not bend his head to hear \n
The Burial Office read, \n
Nor, while the anguish of his soul \n
Tells him he is not dead, \n
Cross his own coffin, as he moves \n
Into the hideous shed. \n
He does not stare upon the air \n
Through a little roof of glass: \n
He does not pray with lips of clay \n
For his agony to pass; \n
Nor feel upon his shuddering cheek \n
The kiss of Caiaphas. \n
II \n
Six weeks the guardsman walked the yard, \n
In the suit of shabby gray: \n
His cricket cap was on his head, \n
And his step was light and gay, \n
But I never saw a man who looked \n
So wistfully at the day. \n
I never saw a man who looked \n
With such a wistful eye \n
Upon that little tent of blue \n
Which prisoners call the sky, \n
And at every wandering cloud that trailed \n
Its ravelled fleeces by. \n
He did not wring his hands, as do \n
Those witless men who dare \n
To try to rear the changeling Hope \n
In the cave of black Despair: \n
He only looked upon the sun, \n
And drank the morning air. \n
He did not wring his hands nor weep, \n
Nor did he peek or pine, \n
But he drank the air as though it held \n
Some healthful anodyne; \n
With open mouth he drank the sun \n
As though it had been wine! \n
And I and all the souls in pain, \n
Who tramped the other ring, \n
Forgot if we ourselves had done \n
A great or little thing, \n
And watched with gaze of dull amaze \n
The man who had to swing. \n
For strange it was to see him pass \n
With a step so light and gay, \n
And strange it was to see him look \n
So wistfully at the day, \n
And strange it was to think that he \n
Had such a debt to pay. \n
The oak and elm have pleasant leaves \n
That in the spring-time shoot: \n
But grim to see is the gallows-tree, \n
With its alder-bitten root, \n
And, green or dry, a man must die \n
Before it bears its fruit! \n
The loftiest place is the seat of grace \n
For which all worldlings try: \n
But who would stand in hempen band \n
Upon a scaffold high, \n
And through a murderer's collar take \n
His last look at the sky? \n
It is sweet to dance to violins \n
When Love and Life are fair: \n
To dance to flutes, to dance to lutes \n
Is delicate and rare: \n
But it is not sweet with nimble feet \n
To dance upon the air! \n
So with curious eyes and sick surmise \n
We watched him day by day, \n
And wondered if each one of us \n
Would end the self-same way, \n
For none can tell to what red Hell \n
His sightless soul may stray. \n
At last the dead man walked no more \n
Amongst the Trial Men, \n
And I knew that he was standing up \n
In the black dock's dreadful pen, \n
And that never would I see his face \n
For weal or woe again. \n
Like two doomed ships that pass in storm \n
We had crossed each other's way: \n
But we made no sign, we said no word, \n
We had no word to say; \n
For we did not meet in the holy night, \n
But in the shameful day. \n
A prison wall was round us both, \n
Two outcast men we were: \n
The world had thrust us from its heart, \n
And God from out His care: \n
And the iron gin that waits for Sin \n
Had caught us in its snare. \n
III \n
In Debtors' Yard the stones are hard, \n
And the dripping wall is high, \n
So it was there he took the air \n
Beneath the leaden sky, \n
And by each side a warder walked, \n
For fear the man might die. \n
Or else he sat with those who watched \n
His anguish night and day; \n
Who watched him when he rose to weep, \n
And when he crouched to pray; \n
Who watched him lest himself should rob \n
Their scaffold of its prey. \n
The Governor was strong upon \n
The Regulations Act: \n
The Doctor said that Death was but \n
A scientific fact: \n
And twice a day the Chaplain called, \n
And left a little tract. \n
And twice a day he smoked his pipe, \n
And drank his quart of beer: \n
His soul was resolute, and held \n
No hiding-place for fear; \n
He often said that he was glad \n
The hangman's day was near. \n
But why he said so strange a thing \n
No warder dared to ask: \n
For he to whom a watcher's doom \n
Is given as his task, \n
Must set a lock upon his lips, \n
And make his face a mask. \n
Or else he might be moved, and try \n
To comfort or console: \n
And what should Human Pity do \n
Pent up in Murderers' Hole? \n
What word of grace in such a place \n
Could help a brother's soul? \n
With slouch and swing around the ring \n
We trod the Fools' Parade! \n
We did not care: we knew we were \n
The Devils' Own Brigade: \n
And shaven head and feet of lead \n
Make a merry masquerade. \n
We tore the tarry rope to shreds \n
With blunt and bleeding nails; \n
We rubbed the doors, and scrubbed the floors, \n
And cleaned the shining rails: \n
And, rank by rank, we soaped the plank, \n
And clattered with the pails. \n
We sewed the sacks, we broke the stones, \n
We turned the dusty drill: \n
We banged the tins, and bawled the hymns, \n
And sweated on the mill: \n
But in the heart of every man \n
Terror was lying still. \n
So still it lay that every day \n
Crawled like a weed-clogged wave: \n
And we forgot the bitter lot \n
That waits for fool and knave, \n
Till once, as we tramped in from work, \n
We passed an open grave. \n
With yawning mouth the horrid hole \n
Gaped for a living thing; \n
The very mud cried out for blood \n
To the thirsty asphalte ring: \n
And we knew that ere one dawn grew fair \n
The fellow had to swing. \n
Right in we went, with soul intent \n
On Death and Dread and Doom: \n
The hangman, with his little bag, \n
Went shuffling through the gloom: \n
And I trembled as I groped my way \n
Into my numbered tomb. \n
That night the empty corridors \n
Were full of forms of Fear, \n
And up and down the iron town \n
Stole feet we could not hear, \n
And through the bars that hide the stars \n
White faces seemed to peer. \n
He lay as one who lies and dreams \n
In a pleasant meadow-land, \n
The watchers watched him as he slept, \n
And could not understand \n
How one could sleep so sweet a sleep \n
With a hangman close at hand. \n
But there is no sleep when men must weep \n
Who never yet have wept: \n
So we- the fool, the fraud, the knave- \n
That endless vigil kept, \n
And through each brain on hands of pain \n
Another's terror crept. \n
Alas! it is a fearful thing \n
To feel another's guilt! \n
For, right within, the sword of Sin \n
Pierced to its poisoned hilt, \n
And as molten lead were the tears we shed \n
For the blood we had not spilt. \n
The warders with their shoes of felt \n
Crept by each padlocked door, \n
And peeped and saw, with eyes of awe, \n
Gray figures on the floor, \n
And wondered why men knelt to pray \n
Who never prayed before. \n
All through the night we knelt and prayed, \n
Mad mourners of a corse! \n
The troubled plumes of midnight shook \n
Like the plumes upon a hearse: \n
And as bitter wine upon a sponge \n
Was the savour of Remorse. \n
The gray cock crew, the red cock crew, \n
But never came the day: \n
And crooked shapes of Terror crouched, \n
In the corners where we lay: \n
And each evil sprite that walks by night \n
Before us seemed to play. \n
They glided past, the glided fast, \n
Like travellers through a mist: \n
They mocked the moon in a rigadoon \n
Of delicate turn and twist, \n
And with formal pace and loathsome grace \n
The phantoms kept their tryst. \n
With mop and mow, we saw them go, \n
Slim shadows hand in hand: \n
About, about, in ghostly rout \n
They trod a saraband: \n
And the damned grotesques made arabesques, \n
Like the wind upon the sand! \n
With the pirouettes of marionettes, \n
They tripped on pointed tread: \n
But with flutes of Fear they filled the ear, \n
As their grisly masque they led, \n
And loud they sang, and long they sang, \n
For they sang to wake the dead. \n
'Oho! ' they cried, 'the world is wide, \n
But fettered limbs go lame! \n
And once, or twice, to throw the dice \n
Is a gentlemanly game, \n
But he does not win who plays with Sin \n
In the secret House of Shame.' \n
No things of air these antics were, \n
That frolicked with such glee: \n
To men whose lives were held in gyves, \n
And whose feet might not go free, \n
Ah! wounds of Christ! they were living things, \n
Most terrible to see. \n
Around, around, they waltzed and wound; \n
Some wheeled in smirking pairs; \n
With the mincing step of a demirep \n
Some sidled up the stairs: \n
And with subtle sneer, and fawning leer, \n
Each helped us at our prayers. \n
The morning wind began to moan, \n
But still the night went on: \n
Through its giant loom the web of gloom \n
Crept till each thread was spun: \n
And, as we prayed, we grew afraid \n
Of the Justice of the Sun. \n
The moaning wind went wandering round \n
The weeping prison wall: \n
Till like a wheel of turning steel \n
We felt the minutes crawl: \n
O moaning wind! what had we done \n
To have such a seneschal? \n
At last I saw the shadowed bars, \n
Like a lattice wrought in lead, \n
Move right across the whitewashed wall \n
That faced my three-plank bed, \n
And I knew that somewhere in the world \n
God's dreadful dawn was red. \n
At six o'clock we cleaned our cells, \n
At seven all was still, \n
But the sough and swing of a mighty wing \n
The prison seemed to fill, \n
For the Lord of Death with icy breath \n
Had entered in to kill. \n
He did not pass in purple pomp, \n
Nor ride a moon-white steed. \n
Three yards of cord and a sliding board \n
Are all the gallows' need: \n
So with rope of shame the Herald came \n
To do the secret deed. \n
We were as men who through a fen \n
Of filthy darkness grope: \n
We did not dare to breathe a prayer, \n
Or to give our anguish scope: \n
Something was dead in each of us, \n
And what was dead was Hope. \n
For Man's grim Justice goes its way \n
And will not swerve aside: \n
It slays the weak, it slays the strong, \n
It has a deadly stride: \n
With iron heel it slays the strong \n
The monstrous parricide! \n
We waited for the stroke of eight: \n
Each tongue was thick with thirst: \n
For the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate \n
That makes a man accursed, \n
And Fate will use a running noose \n
For the best man and the worst. \n
We had no other thing to do, \n
Save to wait for the sign to come: \n
So, like things of stone in a valley lone, \n
Quiet we sat and dumb: \n
But each man's heart beat thick and quick, \n
Like a madman on a drum! \n
With sudden shock the prison-clock \n
Smote on the shivering air, \n
And from all the gaol rose up a wail \n
Of impotent despair, \n
Like the sound the frightened marshes hear \n
From some leper in his lair. \n
And as one sees most fearful things \n
In the crystal of a dream, \n
We saw the greasy hempen rope \n
Hooked to the blackened beam, \n
And heard the prayer the hangman's snare \n
Strangled into a scream. \n
And all the woe that moved him so \n
That he gave that bitter cry, \n
And the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats, \n
None knew so well as I: \n
For he who lives more lives than one \n
More deaths that one must die. \n
IV \n
There is no chapel on the day \n
On which they hang a man: \n
The Chaplain's heart is far too sick, \n
Or his face is far too wan, \n
Or there is that written in his eyes \n
Which none should look upon. \n
So they kept us close till nigh on noon, \n
And then they rang the bell, \n
And the warders with their jingling keys \n
Opened each listening cell, \n
And down the iron stair we tramped, \n
Each from his separate Hell. \n
Out into God's sweet air we went, \n
But not in wonted way, \n
For this man's face was white with fear, \n
And that man's face was gray, \n
And I never saw sad men who looked \n
So wistfully at the day. \n
I never saw sad men who looked \n
With such a wistful eye \n
Upon that little tent of blue \n
We prisoners called the sky, \n
And at every happy cloud that passed \n
In such strange freedom by. \n
But there were those amongst us all \n
Who walked with downcast head, \n
And knew that, had each got his due, \n
They should have died instead: \n
He had but killed a thing that lived, \n
Whilst they had killed the dead. \n
For he who sins a second time \n
Wakes a dead soul to pain, \n
And draws it from its spotted shroud \n
And makes it bleed again, \n
And makes it bleed great gouts of blood, \n
And makes it bleed in vain! \n
Like ape or clown, in monstrous garb \n
With crooked arrows starred, \n
Silently we went round and round \n
The slippery asphalte yard; \n
Silently we went round and round, \n
And no man spoke a word. \n
Silently we went round and round, \n
And through each hollow mind \n
The Memory of dreadful things \n
Rushed like a dreadful wind, \n
And Horror stalked before each man, \n
And Terror crept behind. \n
The warders strutted up and down, \n
And watched their herd of brutes, \n
Their uniforms were spick and span, \n
And they wore their Sunday suits, \n
But we knew the work they had been at, \n
By the quicklime on their boots. \n
For where a grave had opened wide, \n
There was no grave at all: \n
Only a stretch of mud and sand \n
By the hideous prison-wall, \n
And a little heap of burning lime, \n
That the man should have his pall. \n
For he has a pall, this wretched man, \n
Such as few men can claim: \n
Deep down below a prison-yard, \n
Naked, for greater shame, \n
He lies, with fetters on each foot, \n
Wrapt in a sheet of flame! \n
And all the while the burning lime \n
Eats flesh and bone away, \n
It eats the brittle bones by night, \n
And the soft flesh by day, \n
It eats the flesh and bone by turns, \n
But it eats the heart alway. \n
For three long years they will not sow \n
Or root or seedling there: \n
For three long years the unblessed spot \n
Will sterile be and bare, \n
And look upon the wondering sky \n
With unreproachful stare. \n
They think a murderer's heart would taint \n
Each simple seed they sow. \n
It is not true! God's kindly earth \n
Is kindlier than men know, \n
And the red rose would but glow more red, \n
The white rose whiter blow. \n
Out of his mouth a red, red rose! \n
Out of his heart a white! \n
For who can say by what strange way, \n
Christ brings His will to light, \n
Since the barren staff the pilgrim bore \n
Bloomed in the great Pope's sight? \n
But neither milk-white rose nor red \n
May bloom in prison air; \n
The shard, the pebble, and the flint, \n
Are what they give us there: \n
For flowers have been known to heal \n
A common man's despair. \n
So never will wine-red rose or white, \n
Petal by petal, fall \n
On that stretch of mud and sand that lies \n
By the hideous prison-wall, \n
To tell the men who tramp the yard \n
That God's Son died for all. \n
Yet though the hideous prison-wall \n
Still hems him round and round, \n
And a spirit may not walk by night \n
That is with fetters bound, \n
And a spirit may but weep that lies \n
In such unholy ground, \n
He is at peace- this wretched man- \n
At peace, or will be soon: \n
There is no thing to make him mad, \n
Nor does Terror walk at noon, \n
For the lampless Earth in which he lies \n
Has neither Sun nor Moon. \n
They hanged him as a beast is hanged: \n
They did not even toll \n
A requiem that might have brought \n
Rest to his startled soul, \n
But hurriedly they took him out, \n
And hid him in a hole. \n
The warders stripped him of his clothes, \n
And gave him to the flies: \n
They mocked the swollen purple throat, \n
And the stark and staring eyes: \n
And with laughter loud they heaped the shroud \n
In which the convict lies. \n
The Chaplain would not kneel to pray \n
By his dishonoured grave: \n
Nor mark it with that blessed Cross \n
That Christ for sinners gave, \n
Because the man was one of those \n
Whom Christ came down to save. \n
Yet all is well; he has but passed \n
To Life's appointed bourne: \n
And alien tears will fill for him \n
Pity's long-broken urn, \n
For his mourners be outcast men, \n
And outcasts always mourn. \n
V \n
I know not whether Laws be right, \n
Or whether Laws be wrong; \n
All that we know who lie in gaol \n
Is that the wall is strong; \n
And that each day is like a year, \n
A year whose days are long. \n
But this I know, that every Law \n
That men have made for Man, \n
Since first Man took His brother's life, \n
And the sad world began, \n
But straws the wheat and saves the chaff \n
With a most evil fan. \n
This too I know- and wise it were \n
If each could know the same- \n
That every prison that men build \n
Is built with bricks of shame, \n
And bound with bars lest Christ should see \n
How men their brothers maim. \n
With bars they blur the gracious moon, \n
And blind the goodly sun: \n
And the do well to hide their Hell, \n
For in it things are done \n
That Son of things nor son of Man \n
Ever should look upon! \n
The vilest deeds like poison weeds \n
Bloom well in prison-air: \n
It is only what is good in Man \n
That wastes and withers there: \n
Pale Anguish keeps the heavy gate, \n
And the warder is Despair. \n
For they starve the little frightened child \n
Till it weeps both night and day: \n
And they scourge the weak, and flog the fool, \n
And gibe the old and gray, \n
And some grow mad, and all grow bad, \n
And none a word may say. \n
Each narrow cell in which we dwell \n
Is a foul and dark latrine, \n
And the fetid breath of living Death \n
Chokes up each grated screen, \n
And all, but Lust, is turned to dust \n
In Humanity's machine. \n
The brackish water that we drink \n
Creeps with a loathsome slime, \n
And the bitter bread they weigh in scales \n
Is full of chalk and lime, \n
And Sleep will not lie down, but walks \n
Wild-eyed, and cries to Time. \n
But though lean Hunger and green Thirst \n
Like asp with adder fight, \n
We have little care of prison fare, \n
For what chills and kills outright \n
Is that every stone one lifts by day \n
Becomes one's heart by night. \n
With midnight always in one's heart, \n
And twilight in one's cell, \n
We turn the crank, or tear the rope, \n
Each in his separate Hell, \n
And the silence is more awful far \n
Than the sound of a brazen bell. \n
And never a human voice comes near \n
To speak a gentle word: \n
And the eye that watches through the door \n
Is pitiless and hard: \n
And by all forgot, we rot and rot, \n
With soul and body marred. \n
And thus we rust Life's iron chain \n
Degraded and alone: \n
And some men curse, and some men weep, \n
And some men make no moan: \n
But God's eternal Laws are kind \n
And break the heart of stone. \n
And every human heart that breaks, \n
In prison-cell or yard, \n
Is as that broken box that gave \n
Its treasure to the Lord, \n
And filled the unclean leper's house \n
With the scent of costliest nard. \n
Ah! happy they whose hearts can break \n
And peace of pardon win! \n
How else may man make straight his plan \n
And cleanse his soul from Sin? \n
How else but through a broken heart \n
May Lord Christ enter in? \n
And he of the swollen purple throat, \n
And the stark and staring eyes, \n
Waits for the holy hands that took \n
The Thief to Paradise; \n
And a broken and a contrite heart \n
The Lord will not despise. \n
The man in red who reads the Law \n
Gave him three weeks of life, \n
Three little weeks in which to heal \n
His soul of his soul's strife, \n
And cleanse from every blot of blood \n
The hand that held the knife. \n
And with tears of blood he cleansed the hand, \n
The hand that held the steel: \n
For only blood can wipe out blood, \n
And only tears can heal: \n
And the crimson stain that was of Cain \n
Became Christ's snow-white seal. \n
VI \n
In Reading gaol by Reading town \n
There is a pit of shame, \n
And in it lies a wretched man \n
Eaten by teeth of flame, \n
In a burning winding-sheet he lies, \n
And his grave has got no name. \n
And there, till Christ call forth the dead, \n
In silence let him lie: \n
No need to waste the foolish tear, \n
Or heave the windy sigh: \n
The man had killed the thing he loved, \n
And so he had to die. \n
And all men kill the thing they love, \n
By all let this be heard, \n
Some do it with a bitter look, \n
Some with a flattering word, \n
The coward does it with a kiss, \n
The brave man with a sword! \n<|endoftext|>
ballad \n
I speak of love that comes to mind: \n
The moon is faithful, although blind; \n
She moves in thought she cannot speak. \n
Perfect care has made her bleak. \n
I never dreamed the sea so deep, \n
The earth so dark; so long my sleep, \n
I have become another child. \n
I wake to see the world go wild. \n<|endoftext|>
ballad \n
'Lay me in a cushioned chair; \n
Carry me, ye four, \n
With cushions here and cushions there, \n
To see the world once more. \n
'To stable and to kennel go; \n
Bring what is there to bring; \n
Lead my Lollard to and fro, \n
Or gently in a ring. \n
'Put the chair upon the grass: \n
Bring Rody and his hounds, \n
That I may contented pass \n
From these earthly bounds.' \n
His eyelids droop, his head falls low, \n
His old eyes cloud with dreams; \n
The sun upon all things that grow \n
Falls in sleepy streams. \n
Brown Lollard treads upon the lawn, \n
And to the armchair goes, \n
And now the old man's dreams are gone, \n
He smooths the long brown nose. \n
And now moves many a pleasant tongue \n
Upon his wasted hands, \n
For leading aged hounds and young \n
The huntsman near him stands. \n
'Huntsmam Rody, blow the horn, \n
Make the hills reply.' \n
The huntsman loosens on the morn \n
A gay wandering cry. \n
Fire is in the old man's eyes, \n
His fingers move and sway, \n
And when the wandering music dies \n
They hear him feebly say, \n
'Huntsman Rody, blow the horn, \n
Make the hills reply.' \n
'I cannot blow upon my horn, \n
I can but weep and sigh.' \n
Servants round his cushioned place \n
Are with new sorrow wrung; \n
Hounds are gazing on his face, \n
Aged hounds and young. \n
One blind hound only lies apart \n
On the sun-smitten grass; \n
He holds deep commune with his heart: \n
The moments pass and pass: \n
The blind hound with a mournful din \n
Lifts slow his wintry head; \n
The servants bear the body in; \n
The hounds wail for the dead. \n<|endoftext|>
ballad \n
Author Note: In Finland there is a Castle which is called the New Rock, moated about with a river of unfounded depth, the water black and the fish therein \n
very distateful to the palate. In this are spectres often seen, which \n
foreshew either the death of the Governor, or some prime officer \n
belonging to the place; and most commonly it appeareth in the shape of \n
an harper, sweetly singing and dallying and playing under the water. \n
It is reported of one Donica, that after she was dead, the Devil walked \n
in her body for the space of two years, so that none suspected but that \n
she was still alive; for she did both speak and eat, though very \n
sparingly; only she had a deep paleness on her countenance, which was \n
the only sign of death. At length a Magician coming by where she was \n
then in the company of many other virgins, as soon as he beheld her he \n
said, "fair Maids, why keep you company with the dead Virgin whom you \n
suppose to be alive?" when taking away the magic charm which was tied \n
under her arm, the body fell down lifeless and without motion. \n
The following Ballad is founded on these stories. They are to be found \n
in the notes to The Hierarchies of the blessed Angels; a Poem by Thomas \n
Heywood, printed in folio by Adam Islip, 1635. \n
High on a rock, whose castled shade \n
Darken'd the lake below, \n
In ancient strength majestic stood \n
The towers of Arlinkow. \n
The fisher in the lake below \n
Durst never cast his net, \n
Nor ever swallow in its waves \n
Her passing wings would wet. \n
The cattle from its ominous banks \n
In wild alarm would run, \n
Tho' parched with thirst and faint beneath \n
The summer's scorching sun. \n
For sometimes when no passing breeze \n
The long lank sedges waved, \n
All white with foam and heaving high \n
Its deafening billows raved; \n
And when the tempest from its base \n
The rooted pine would shake, \n
The powerless storm unruffling swept \n
Across the calm dead lake. \n
And ever then when Death drew near \n
The house of Arlinkow, \n
Its dark unfathom'd depths did send \n
Strange music from below. \n
The Lord of Arlinkow was old, \n
One only child had he, \n
Donica was the Maiden's name \n
As fair as fair might be. \n
A bloom as bright as opening morn \n
Flush'd o'er her clear white cheek, \n
The music of her voice was mild, \n
Her full dark eyes were meek. \n
Far was her beauty known, for none \n
So fair could Finland boast, \n
Her parents loved the Maiden much, \n
Young EBERHARD loved her most. \n
Together did they hope to tread \n
The pleasant path of life, \n
For now the day drew near to make \n
Donica Eberhard's wife. \n
The eve was fair and mild the air, \n
Along the lake they stray; \n
The eastern hill reflected bright \n
The fading tints of day. \n
And brightly o'er the water stream'd \n
The liquid radiance wide; \n
Donica's little dog ran on \n
And gambol'd at her side. \n
Youth, Health, and Love bloom'd on her cheek, \n
Her full dark eyes express \n
In many a glance to Eberhard \n
Her soul's meek tenderness. \n
Nor sound was heard, nor passing gale \n
Sigh'd thro' the long lank sedge, \n
The air was hushed, no little wave \n
Dimpled the water's edge. \n
Sudden the unfathom'd lake sent forth \n
Strange music from beneath, \n
And slowly o'er the waters sail'd \n
The solemn sounds of Death. \n
As the deep sounds of Death arose, \n
Donica's cheek grew pale, \n
And in the arms of Eberhard \n
The senseless Maiden fell. \n
Loudly the youth in terror shriek'd, \n
And loud he call'd for aid, \n
And with a wild and eager look \n
Gaz'd on the death-pale Maid. \n
But soon again did better thoughts \n
In Eberhard arise, \n
And he with trembling hope beheld \n
The Maiden raise her eyes. \n
And on his arm reclin'd she moved \n
With feeble pace and slow, \n
And soon with strength recover'd reach'd \n
Yet never to Donica's cheek \n
Return'd the lively hue, \n
Her cheeks were deathy, white, and wan, \n
Her lips a livid blue. \n
Her eyes so bright and black of yore \n
Were now more black and bright, \n
And beam'd strange lustre in her face \n
So deadly wan and white. \n
The dog that gambol'd by her side, \n
And lov'd with her to stray, \n
Now at his alter'd mistress howl'd \n
And fled in fear away. \n
Yet did the faithful Eberhard \n
Not love the Maid the less; \n
He gaz'd with sorrow, but he gaz'd \n
With deeper tenderness. \n
And when he found her health unharm'd \n
He would not brook delay, \n
But press'd the not unwilling Maid \n
To fix the bridal day. \n
And when at length it came, with joy \n
They hail'd the bridal day, \n
And onward to the house of God \n
They went their willing way. \n
And as they at the altar stood \n
And heard the sacred rite, \n
The hallowed tapers dimly stream'd \n
A pale sulphureous light. \n
And as the Youth with holy warmth \n
Her hand in his did hold, \n
Sudden he felt Donica's hand \n
Grow deadly damp and cold. \n
And loudly did he shriek, for lo! \n
A Spirit met his view, \n
And Eberhard in the angel form \n
His own Donica knew. \n
That instant from her earthly frame \n
Howling the Daemon fled, \n
And at the side of Eberhard \n
The livid form fell dead. \n<|endoftext|>
ballad \n
Author Note: Divers Princes and Noblemen being assembled in a beautiful and fair \n
Palace, which was situate upon the river Rhine, they beheld a boat or \n
small barge make toward the shore, drawn by a Swan in a silver chain, \n
the one end fastened about her neck, the other to the vessel; and in it \n
an unknown soldier, a man of a comely personage and graceful presence, \n
who stept upon the shore; which done, the boat guided by the Swan left \n
him, and floated down the river. This man fell afterward in league with \n
a fair gentlewoman, married her, and by her had many children. After \n
some years, the same Swan came with the same barge into the same place; \n
the soldier entering into it, was carried thence the way he came, left \n
wife, children and family, and was never seen amongst them after. \n
Now who can judge this to be other than one of those spirits that are \n
named Incubi? says Thomas Heywood. I have adopted his story, but not his \n
solution, making the unknown soldier not an evil spirit, but one who had \n
purchased happiness of a malevolent being, by the promised sacrifice of \n
his first-born child. \n
Bright on the mountain's heathy slope \n
The day's last splendors shine \n
And rich with many a radiant hue \n
Gleam gayly on the Rhine. \n
And many a one from Waldhurst's walls \n
Along the river stroll'd, \n
As ruffling o'er the pleasant stream \n
The evening gales came cold. \n
So as they stray'd a swan they saw \n
Sail stately up and strong, \n
And by a silver chain she drew \n
A little boat along, \n
Whose streamer to the gentle breeze \n
Long floating fluttered light, \n
Beneath whose crimson canopy \n
There lay reclin'd a knight. \n
With arching crest and swelling breast \n
On sail'd the stately swan \n
And lightly up the parting tide \n
The little boat came on. \n
And onward to the shore they drew \n
And leapt to land the knight, \n
And down the stream the swan-drawn boat \n
Fell soon beyond the sight. \n
Was never a Maid in Waldhurst's walls \n
Might match with Margaret, \n
Her cheek was fair, her eyes were dark, \n
Her silken locks like jet. \n
And many a rich and noble youth \n
Had strove to win the fair, \n
But never a rich or noble youth \n
Could rival Rudiger. \n
At every tilt and turney he \n
Still bore away the prize, \n
For knightly feats superior still \n
And knightly courtesies. \n
His gallant feats, his looks, his love, \n
Soon won the willing fair, \n
And soon did Margaret become \n
The wife of Rudiger. \n
Like morning dreams of happiness \n
Fast roll'd the months away, \n
For he was kind and she was kind \n
And who so blest as they? \n
Yet Rudiger would sometimes sit \n
Absorb'd in silent thought \n
And his dark downward eye would seem \n
With anxious meaning fraught; \n
But soon he rais'd his looks again \n
And smil'd his cares eway, \n
And mid the hall of gaiety \n
Was none like him so gay. \n
And onward roll'd the waining months, \n
The hour appointed came, \n
And Margaret her Rudiger \n
Hail'd with a father's name. \n
But silently did Rudiger \n
The little infant see, \n
And darkly on the babe he gaz'd \n
And very sad was he. \n
And when to bless the little babe \n
The holy Father came, \n
To cleanse the stains of sin away \n
In Christ's redeeming name, \n
Then did the cheek of Rudiger \n
Assume a death-pale hue, \n
And on his clammy forehead stood \n
The cold convulsive dew; \n
And faltering in his speech he bade \n
The Priest the rites delay, \n
Till he could, to right health restor'd, \n
Enjoy the festive day. \n
When o'er the many-tinted sky \n
He saw the day decline, \n
He called upon his Margaret \n
To walk beside the Rhine. \n
"And we will take the little babe, \n
"For soft the breeze that blows, \n
"And the wild murmurs of the stream \n
"Will lull him to repose." \n
So forth together did they go, \n
The evening breeze was mild, \n
And Rudiger upon his arm \n
Did pillow the sweet child. \n
And many a one from Waldhurst's walls \n
Along the banks did roam, \n
But soon the evening wind came cold, \n
And all betook them home. \n
Yet Rudiger in silent mood \n
Along the banks would roam, \n
Nor aught could Margaret prevail \n
To turn his footsteps home. \n
"Oh turn thee--turn thee Rudiger, \n
"The rising mists behold, \n
"The evening wind is damp and chill, \n
"The little babe is cold!" \n
"Now hush thee--hush thee Margaret, \n
"The mists will do no harm, \n
"And from the wind the little babe \n
"Lies sheltered on my arm." \n
"Oh turn thee--turn thee Rudiger, \n
"Why onward wilt thou roam? \n
"The moon is up, the night is cold, \n
"And we are far from home." \n
He answered not, for now he saw \n
A Swan come sailing strong, \n
And by a silver chain she drew \n
A little boat along. \n
To shore they came, and to the boat \n
Fast leapt he with the child, \n
And in leapt Margaret--breathless now \n
And pale with fear and wild. \n
With arching crest and swelling breast \n
On sail'd the stately swan, \n
And lightly down the rapid tide \n
The little boat went on. \n
The full-orb'd moon that beam'd around \n
Pale splendor thro' the night, \n
Cast through the crimson canopy \n
A dim-discoloured light. \n
And swiftly down the hurrying stream \n
In silence still they sail, \n
And the long streamer fluttering fast \n
Flapp'd to the heavy gale. \n
And he was mute in sullen thought \n
And she was mute with fear, \n
Nor sound but of the parting tide \n
Broke on the listening ear. \n
The little babe began to cry \n
And waked his mother's care, \n
"Now give to me the little babe \n
"For God's sake, Rudiger!" \n
"Now hush thee, hush thee Margaret! \n
"Nor my poor heart distress-- \n
"I do but pay perforce the price \n
"Of former happiness. \n
"And hush thee too my little babe, \n
"Thy cries so feeble cease: \n
"Lie still, lie still;--a little while \n
"And thou shalt be at peace." \n
So as he spake to land they drew, \n
And swift he stept on shore, \n
And him behind did Margaret \n
Close follow evermore. \n
It was a place all desolate, \n
Nor house nor tree was there, \n
And there a rocky mountain rose \n
Barren, and bleak, and bare. \n
And at its base a cavern yawn'd, \n
No eye its depth might view, \n
For in the moon-beam shining round \n
That darkness darker grew. \n
Cold Horror crept thro' Margaret's blood, \n
Her heart it paus'd with fear, \n
When Rudiger approach'd the cave \n
And cried, "lo I am here!" \n
A deep sepulchral sound the cave \n
Return'd "lo I am here!" \n
And black from out the cavern gloom \n
Two giant arms appear. \n
And Rudiger approach'd and held \n
The little infant nigh; \n
Then Margaret shriek'd, and gather'd then \n
New powers from agony. \n
And round the baby fast and firm \n
Her trembling arms she folds, \n
And with a strong convulsive grasp \n
The little infant holds. \n
"Now help me, Jesus!" loud she cries. \n
And loud on God she calls; \n
Then from the grasp of Rudiger \n
The little infant falls. \n
And now he shriek'd, for now his frame \n
The huge black arms clasp'd round, \n
And dragg'd the wretched Rudiger \n
Adown the dark profound. \n<|endoftext|>

I KNOW my love is true, \n
And oh the day is fair. \n
The sky is dear and blue, \n
The flowers are rich of hue, \n
The air I breathe is rare, \n
I have no grief or care; \n
For my own love is true, \n
And oh the day is fair. \n
My love is false I find, \n
And oh the day is dark. \n
Blows sadly down the wind, \n
While sorrow holds my mind; \n
I do not hear the lark, \n
For quenched is life's dear spark,— \n
My love is false I find, \n
And oh the day is dark! \n
For love doth make the day \n
Or dark or doubly bright; \n
Her beams along the way \n
Dispel the gloom and gray. \n
She lives and all is bright, \n
She dies and life is night. \n
For love doth make the day, \n
Or dark or doubly bright. \n<|endoftext|>

Prudence Mears hath an old blue plate \n

ballad \n
OH, enter old minstrel, thou time-honour'd one! \n
We children are here in the hall all alone, \n
The portals we straightway will bar. \n
Our mother is praying, our father is gone \n
To the forest, on wolves to make war. \n
Oh sing us a ballad, the tale then repeat, \n
'Till brother and I learn it right; \n
We long have been hoping a minstrel to meet, \n
For children hear tales with delight. \n
"At midnight, when darkness its fearful veil weaves, \n
His lofty and stately old castle he leaves, \n
But first he has buried his wealth. \n
What figure is that in his arms one perceives, \n
As the Count quits the gateway by stealth? \n
O'er what is his mantle so hastily thrown? \n
What bears he along in his flight? \n
A daughter it is, and she gently sleeps on"-- \n
The children they hear with delight. \n
"The morning soon glimmers. the world is so wide, \n
In valleys and forests a home is supplied, \n
The bard in each village is cheer'd. \n
Thus lives he and wanders, while years onward glide, \n
And longer still waxes his beard; \n
But the maiden so fair in his arms grows amain, \n
'Neath her star all-protecting and bright, \n
Secured in the mantle from wind and from rain--" \n
The children they hear with delight. \n
"And year upon year with swift footstep now steals, \n
The mantle it fades, many rents it reveals, \n
The maiden no more it can hold. \n
The father he sees her, what rapture he feels! \n
His joy cannot now be controll'd. \n
How worthy she seems of the race whence she springs, \n
How noble and fair to the sight! \n
What wealth to her dearly-loved father she brings!"-- \n
The children they hear with delight. \n
"Then comes there a princely knight galloping by, \n
She stretches her hand out, as soon as he's nigh, \n
But alms he refuses to give. \n
He seizes her hand, with a smile in his eye: \n
'Thou art mine!' he exclaims, 'while I live!' \n
'When thou know'st,' cries the old man, 'the treasure that's \n
there, \n
A princess thou'lt make her of right; \n
Betroth'd be she now, on this spot green and fair--'" \n
The children they hear with delight. \n
"So she's bless'd by the priest on the hallowed place, \n
And she goes with a smiling but sorrowful face, \n
From her father she fain would not part. \n
The old man still wanders with ne'er-changing pace, \n
He covers with joy his sad heart. \n
So I think of my daughter, as years pass away, \n
And my grandchildren far from my sight; \n
I bless them by night, and I bless them by day"-- \n
The children they hear with delight. \n
He blesses the children: a knocking they hear, \n
The father it is! They spring forward in fear, \n
The old man they cannot conceal-- \n
"Thou beggar, wouldst lure, then, my children so dear? \n
Straight seize him, ye vassals of steel! \n
To the dungeon most deep, with the fool-hardy knave!" \n
The mother from far hears the fight; \n
She hastens with flatt'ring entreaty to crave-- \n
The children they hear with delight. \n
The vassals they suffer the Bard to stand there, \n
And mother and children implore him to spare, \n
The proud prince would stifle his ire, \n
'Till driven to fury at hearing their prayer, \n
His smouldering anger takes fire: \n
"Thou pitiful race! Oh, thou beggarly crew! \n
Eclipsing my star, once so bright! \n
Ye'll bring me destruction, ye sorely shall rue!" \n
The children they hear with affright. \n
The old man still stands there with dignified mien, \n
The vassals of steel quake before him, I ween, \n
The Count's fury increases in power; \n
"My wedded existence a curse long has been, \n
And these are the fruits from that flower! \n
'Tis ever denied, and the saying is true, \n
That to wed with the base-born is right; \n
The beggar has borne me a beggarly crew,--" \n
The children they hear with affright. \n
"If the husband, the father, thus treats you with scorn, \n
If the holiest bonds by him rashly are torn, \n
Then come to your father--to me! \n
The beggar may gladden life's pathway forlorn, \n
Though aged and weak he may be. \n
This castle is mine! thou hast made it thy prey, \n
Thy people 'twas put me to flight; \n
The tokens I bear will confirm what I say"-- \n
The children they hear with delight. \n
"The king who erst govern'd returneth again, \n
And restores to the Faithful the goods that were ta'en, \n
I'll unseal all my treasures the while; \n
The laws shall be gentle, and peaceful the reign"-- \n
The old man thus cries with a smile-- \n
"Take courage, my son! all hath turned out for good, \n
And each hath a star that is bright, \n
Those the princess hath borne thee are princely in blood,"-- \n
The children thy hear with delight. \n<|endoftext|>
ballad \n
WHEN we were girl and boy together, \n
We toss’d about the flowers \n
And wreath’d the blushing hours \n
Into a posy green and sweet. \n
I sought the youngest, best, \n
And never was at rest \n
Till I had laid them at thy fairy feet. \n
But the days of childhood they were fleet, \n
And the blooming sweet-briar-breath’d weather, \n
When we were boy and girl together. \n
Then we were lad and lass together, \n
And sought the kiss of night \n
Before we felt aright, \n
Sitting and singing soft and sweet. \n
The dearest thought of heart \n
With thee ’t was joy to part, \n
And the greater half was thine, as meet. \n
Still my eyelid’s dewy, my veins they beat \n
At the starry summer-evening weather, \n
When we were lad and lass together. \n
And we are man and wife together, \n
Although thy breast, once bold \n
With song, be clos’d and cold \n
Beneath flowers’ roots and birds’ light feet. \n
Yet sit I by thy tomb, \n
And dissipate the gloom \n
With songs of loving faith and sorrow sweet. \n
And fate and darkling grave kind dreams do cheat, \n
That, while fair life, young hope, despair and death are, \n
We ’re boy and girl, and lass and lad, and man and wife together. \n<|endoftext|>
ballad \n
The old priest Peter Gilligan \n
Was weary night and day \n
For half his flock were in their beds \n
Or under green sods lay. \n
Once, while he nodded in a chair \n
At the moth-hour of the eve \n
Another poor man sent for him, \n
And he began to grieve. \n
'I have no rest, nor joy, nor peace, \n
For people die and die; \n
And after cried he, 'God forgive! \n
My body spake not I!' \n
He knelt, and leaning on the chair \n
He prayed and fell asleep; \n
And the moth-hour went from the fields, \n
And stars began to peep. \n
They slowly into millions grew, \n
And leaves shook in the wind \n
And God covered the world with shade \n
And whispered to mankind. \n
Upon the time of sparrow chirp \n
When the moths came once more, \n
The old priest Peter Gilligan \n
Stood upright on the floor. \n
'Mavrone, mavrone! The man has died \n
While I slept in the chair.' \n
He roused his horse out of its sleep \n
And rode with little care. \n
He rode now as he never rode, \n
By rocky lane and fen; \n
The sick man's wife opened the door, \n
'Father! you come again!' \n
'And is the poor man dead?' he cried \n
'He died an hour ago.' \n
The old priest Peter Gilligan \n
In grief swayed to and fro. \n
'When you were gone, he turned and died, \n
As merry as a bird.' \n
The old priest Peter Gilligan \n
He knelt him at that word. \n
'He Who hath made the night of stars \n
For souls who tire and bleed, \n
Sent one of this great angels down, \n
To help me in my need. \n
'He Who is wrapped in purple robes, \n
With planets in His care \n
Had pity on the least of things \n
Asleep upon a chair.' \n<|endoftext|>
ballad \n
Down by the flash of the restless water \n
The dim White Ship like a white bird lay; \n
Laughing at life and the world they sought her, \n
And out she swung to the silvering bay. \n
Then off they flew on their roystering way, \n
And the keen moon fired the light foam flying \n
Up from the flood where the faint stars play, \n
And the bones of the brave in the wave are lying. \n
'T was a king's fair son with a king's fair daughter, \n
And full three hundred beside, they say, -- \n
Revelling on for the lone, cold slaughter \n
So soon to seize them and hide them for aye; \n
But they danced and they drank and their souls grew gay, \n
Nor ever they knew of a ghoul's eye spying \n
Their splendor a flickering phantom to stray \n
Where the bones of the brave in the wave are lying. \n
Through the mist of a drunken dream they brought her \n
(This wild white bird) for the sea-fiend's prey: \n
The pitiless reef in his hard clutch caught her, \n
And hurled her down where the dead men stay. \n
A torturing silence of wan dismay -- \n
Shrieks and curses of mad souls dying -- \n
Then down they sank to slumber and sway \n
Where the bones of the brave in the wave are lying. \n
ENVOY \n
Prince, do you sleep to the sound alway \n
Of the mournful surge and the sea-birds' crying? -- \n
Or does love still shudder and steel still slay, \n
Where the bones of the brave in the wave are lying? \n<|endoftext|>
ballad \n
Into the woods my Master went, \n
Clean forspent, forspent. \n
Into the woods my Master came, \n
Forspent with love and shame. \n
But the olives they were not blind to Him, \n
The little gray leaves were kind to Him: \n
The thorn-tree had a mind to Him \n
When into the woods He came. \n
Out of the woods my Master went, \n
And He was well content. \n
Out of the woods my Master came, \n
Content with death and shame. \n

From under the trees they drew Him last: \n
'Twas on a tree they slew Him - last \n

ballad \n
Rudolph Reed was oaken. \n
His wife was oaken too. \n
And his two good girls and his good little man \n
Oakened as they grew. \n
"I am not hungry for berries. \n
I am not hungry for bread. \n
But hungry hungry for a house \n
Where at night a man in bed \n
"May never hear the plaster \n
Stir as if in pain. \n
May never hear the roaches \n
Falling like fat rain. \n
"Where never wife and children need \n
Go blinking through the gloom. \n
Where every room of many rooms \n
Will be full of room. \n
"Oh my home may have its east or west \n
Or north or south behind it. \n
All I know is I shall know it, \n
And fight for it when I find it." \n
The agent's steep and steady stare \n
Corroded to a grin. \n
Why you black old, tough old hell of a man, \n
Move your family in! \n
Nary a grin grinned Rudolph Reed, \n
Nary a curse cursed he, \n
But moved in his House. With his dark little wife, \n
And his dark little children three. \n
A neighbor would look, with a yawning eye \n
That squeezed into a slit. \n
But the Rudolph Reeds and children three \n
Were too joyous to notice it. \n
For were they not firm in a home of their own \n
With windows everywhere \n
And a beautiful banistered stair \n
And a front yard for flowers and a back for grass? \n
The first night, a rock, big as two fists. \n
The second, a rock big as three. \n
But nary a curse cursed Rudolph Reed. \n
(Though oaken as man could be.) \n
The third night, a silvery ring of glass. \n
Patience arched to endure, \n
But he looked, and lo! small Mabel's blood \n
Was staining her gaze so pure. \n
Then up did rise our Roodoplh Reed \n
And pressed the hand of his wife, \n
And went to the door with a thirty-four \n
And a beastly butcher knife. \n
He ran like a mad thing into the night \n
And the words in his mouth were stinking. \n
By the time he had hurt his first white man \n
He was no longer thinking. \n
By the time he had hurt his fourth white man \n
Rudolph Reed was dead. \n
His neighbors gathered and kicked his corpse. \n
"Nigger--" his neighbors said. \n
Small Mabel whimpered all night long, \n
For calling herself the cause. \n
Her oak-eyed mother did no thing \n
But change the bloody gauze. \n<|endoftext|>
ballad \n
Up yonder in Buena Park \n
There is a famous spot, \n
In legend and in history \n
Yclept the Waller Lot. \n
There children play in daytime \n
And lovers stroll by dark, \n
For 't is the goodliest trysting-place \n
In all Buena Park. \n
Once on a time that beauteous maid, \n
Sweet little Sissy Knott, \n
Took out her pretty doll to walk \n
Within the Waller Lot. \n
While thus she fared, from Ravenswood \n
Came Injuns o'er the plain, \n
And seized upon that beauteous maid \n
And rent her doll in twain. \n
Oh, 't was a piteous thing to hear \n
Her lamentations wild; \n
She tore her golden curls and cried: \n
"My child! My child! My child!" \n
Alas, what cared those Injun chiefs \n
How bitterly wailed she? \n
They never had been mothers, \n
And they could not hope to be! \n
"Have done with tears," they rudely quoth, \n
And then they bound her hands; \n
For they proposed to take her off \n
To distant border lands. \n
But, joy! from Mr. Eddy's barn \n
Doth Willie Clow behold \n
The sight that makes his hair rise up \n
And all his blood run cold. \n
He put his fingers in his mouth \n
And whistled long and clear, \n
And presently a goodly horde \n
Of cow-boys did appear. \n
Cried Willie Clow: "My comrades bold, \n
Haste to the Waller Lot, \n
And rescue from that Injun band \n
Our charming Sissy Knott!" \n
"Spare neither Injun buck nor squaw, \n
But smite them hide and hair! \n
Spare neither sex nor age nor size, \n
And no condition spare!" \n
Then sped that cow-boy band away, \n
Full of revengeful wrath, \n
And Kendall Evans rode ahead \n
Upon a hickory lath. \n
And next came gallant Dady Field \n
And Willie's brother Kent, \n
The Eddy boys and Robbie James, \n
On murderous purpose bent. \n
For they were much beholden to \n
That maid - in sooth, the lot \n
Were very, very much in love \n
With charming Sissy Knott. \n
What wonder? She was beauty's queen, \n
And good beyond compare; \n
Moreover, it was known she was \n
Her wealthy father's heir! \n
Now when the Injuns saw that band \n
They trembled with affright, \n
And yet they thought the cheapest thing \n
To do was stay and fight. \n
So sturdily they stood their ground, \n
Nor would their prisoner yield, \n
Despite the wrath of Willie Clow \n
And gallant Dady Field. \n
Oh, never fiercer battle raged \n
Upon the Waller Lot, \n
And never blood more freely flowed \n
Than flowed for Sissy Knott! \n
An Injun chief of monstrous size \n
Got Kendall Evans down, \n
And Robbie James was soon o'erthrown \n
By one of great renown. \n
And Dady Field was sorely done, \n
And Willie Clow was hurt, \n
And all that gallant cow-boy band \n
Lay wallowing in the dirt. \n
But still they strove with might and main \n
Till all the Waller Lot \n
Was strewn with hair and gouts of gore - \n
All, all for Sissy Knott! \n
Then cried the maiden in despair: \n
"Alas, I sadly fear \n
The battle and my hopes are lost, \n
Unless some help appear!" \n
Lo, as she spoke, she saw afar \n
The rescuer looming up - \n
The pride of all Buena Park, \n
Clow's famous yellow pup! \n
"Now, sick'em, Don," the maiden cried, \n
"Now, sick'em, Don!" cried she; \n
Obedient Don at once complied - \n
As ordered, so did he. \n
He sicked'em all so passing well \n
That, overcome by fright, \n
The Indian horde gave up the fray \n
And safety sought in flight. \n
They ran and ran and ran and ran \n
O'er valley, plain, and hill; \n
And if they are not walking now, \n
Why, then, they're running still. \n
The cow-boys rose up from the dust \n
With faces black and blue; \n
"Remember, beauteous maid," said they, \n
"We've bled and died for you!" \n
"And though we suffer grievously, \n
We gladly hail the lot \n
That brings us toils and pains and wounds \n
For charming Sissy Knott!" \n
But Sissy Knott still wailed and wept, \n
And still her fate reviled; \n
For who could patch her dolly up - \n
Who, who could mend her child? \n
Then out her doting mother came, \n
And soothed her daughter then; \n
"Grieve not, my darling, I will sew \n
Your dolly up again!" \n
Joy soon succeeded unto grief, \n
And tears were soon dried up, \n
And dignities were heaped upon \n
Clow's noble yellow pup. \n
Him all that goodly company \n
Did as deliverer hail - \n
They tied a ribbon round his neck, \n
Another round his tail. \n
And every anniversary day \n
Upon the Waller Lot \n
They celebrate the victory won \n
For charming Sissy Knott. \n
And I, the poet of these folk, \n
Am ordered to compile \n
This truly famous history \n
In good old ballad style. \n
Which having done as to have earned \n
The sweet rewards of fame, \n
In what same style I did begin \n
I now shall end the same. \n
So let us sing: Long live the King, \n
Long live the Queen and Jack, \n
Long live the ten-spot and the ace, \n
And also all the pack. \n<|endoftext|>

O might those sighes and teares returne againe \n
Into my breast and eyes, which I have spent, \n
That I might in this holy discontent \n
Mourne with some fruit, as I have mourn'd in vaine; \n
In mine Idolatry what showres of raine \n
Mine eyes did waste? what griefs my heart did rent? \n
That sufferance was my sinne; now I repent; \n
'Cause I did sufffer I must suffer paine. \n

But if our mindes to these soules be descry'd \n

Apparent in us, not immediately, \n
How shall my mindes white truth by them be try'd? \n

And therefore if to love can be desert, \n

This weary minstrel-life that once was girt \n
To climb Aornus, and can scarce avail \n
To pipe now 'gainst the valley nightingale \n
A melancholy music,--why advert \n
To these things? O Belovèd, it is plain \n
I am not of thy worth nor for thy place! \n
And yet, because I love thee, I obtain \n
From that same love this vindicating grace, \n

Love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate, \n
Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving: \n

Or, if it do, not from those lips of thine, \n
That have profaned their scarlet ornaments \n
And seal'd false bonds of love as oft as mine, \n
Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents. \n
Be it lawful I love thee, as thou lovest those \n
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee: \n
Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows \n

That falls in well with mine, and certes brought \n
A sense of pleasant ease on such a day" - \n
For these things in themselves, Beloved, may \n
Be changed, or change for thee,--and love, so wrought, \n
May be unwrought so. Neither love me for \n
Thine own dear pity's wiping my cheeks dry, - \n
A creature might forget to weep, who bore \n

Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind, \n
Still constant in a wondrous excellence; \n
Therefore my verse to constancy confined, \n
One thing expressing, leaves out difference. \n

'Fair, kind, and true' varying to other words; \n

Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents, \n
Divert strong minds to the course of altering things; \n
Alas, why, fearing of time's tyranny, \n
Might I not then say 'Now I love you best,' \n

I want to eat your skin like a whole almond. \n
I want to eat the sunbeam flaring in your lovely body, \n

My hand to hold my spirit so far off \n
From myself.. me.. that I should bring thee proof, \n
In words of love hid in me...out of reach. \n
Nay, let the silence of my womanhood \n
Commend my woman-love to thy belief, \n
Seeing that I stand unwon (however wooed) \n

Come back to me, who wait and watch for you:-- \n
Or come not yet, for it is over then, \n
And long it is before you come again, \n
So far between my pleasures are and few. \n
While, when you come not, what I do I do \n
Thinking "Now when he comes," my sweetest when:" \n
For one man is my world of all the men \n
This wide world holds; O love, my world is you. \n
Howbeit, to meet you grows almost a pang \n
Because the pang of parting comes so soon; \n
My hope hangs waning, waxing, like a moon \n
Between the heavenly days on which we meet: \n
Ah me, but where are now the songs I sang \n
When life was sweet because you call'd them sweet? \n
2 \n
Era già 1'ora che volge il desio. \n
- Dante \n
Ricorro al tempo ch' io vi vidi prima. \n
- Petrarca \n
I wish I could remember that first day, \n
First hour, first moment of your meeting me, \n
If bright or dim the season, it might be \n
Summer or winter for aught I can say; \n
So unrecorded did it slip away, \n
So blind was I to see and to foresee, \n
So dull to mark the budding of my tree \n
That would not blossom yet for many a May. \n
If only I could recollect it, such \n
A day of days! I let it come and go \n
As traceless as a thaw of bygone snow; \n
It seem'd to mean so little, meant so much; \n
If only now I could recall that touch, \n
First touch of hand in hand--Did one but know! \n
3 \n
O ombre vane, fuor che ne l'aspetto! \n
- Dante \n
Immaginata guida la conduce. \n
- Petrarca \n
I dream of you to wake: would that I might \n
Dream of you and not wake but slumber on; \n
Nor find with dreams the dear companion gone, \n
As summer ended summer birds take flight. \n
In happy dreams I hold you full in sight, \n
I blush again who waking look so wan; \n
Brighter than sunniest day that ever shone, \n
In happy dreams your smile makes day of night. \n
Thus only in a dream we are at one, \n
Thus only in a dream we give and take \n
The faith that maketh rich who take or give; \n
If thus to sleep is sweeter than to wake, \n
To die were surely sweeter than to live, \n
Though there be nothing new beneath the sun. \n
4 \n
Poca favilla gran fliamma seconda. \n
- Dante \n
Ogni altra cosa, ogni pensier va fore, \n
E sol ivi con voi rimansi amore. \n
- Petrarca \n
I lov'd you first: but afterwards your love \n
Outsoaring mine, sang such a loftier song \n
As drown'd the friendly cooings of my dove. \n
Which owes the other most? my love was long, \n
And yours one moment seem'd to wax more strong; \n
I lov'd and guess'd at you, you construed me-- \n
And lov'd me for what might or might not be \n
Nay, weights and measures do us both a wrong. \n
For verily love knows not "mine" or "thine;" \n
With separate "I" and "thou" free love has done, \n
For one is both and both are one in love: \n
Rich love knows nought of "thine that is not mine;" \n
Both have the strength and both the length thereof, \n
Both of us, of the love which makes us one. \n
5 \n
Amor che a nullo amato amar perdona. \n
- Dante \n
Amor m'addusse in sì gioiosa spene. \n
- Petrarca \n
O my heart's heart, and you who are to me \n
More than myself myself, God be with you, \n
Keep you in strong obedience leal and true \n
To Him whose noble service setteth free, \n
Give you all good we see or can foresee, \n
Make your joys many and your sorrows few, \n
Bless you in what you bear and what you do, \n
Yea, perfect you as He would have you be. \n
So much for you; but what for me, dear friend? \n
To love you without stint and all I can \n
Today, tomorrow, world without an end; \n
To love you much and yet to love you more, \n
As Jordan at his flood sweeps either shore; \n
Since woman is the helpmeet made for man. \n
6 \n
Or puoi la quantitate \n
Comprender de l'amor che a te mi scalda. \n
- Dante \n
Non vo' che da tal nodo mi scioglia. \n
- Petrarca \n
Trust me, I have not earn'd your dear rebuke, \n
I love, as you would have me, God the most; \n
Would lose not Him, but you, must one be lost, \n
Nor with Lot's wife cast back a faithless look \n
Unready to forego what I forsook; \n
This say I, having counted up the cost, \n
This, though I be the feeblest of God's host, \n
The sorriest sheep Christ shepherds with His crook. \n
Yet while I love my God the most, I deem \n
That I can never love you overmuch; \n
I love Him more, so let me love you too; \n
Yea, as I apprehend it, love is such \n
I cannot love you if I love not Him, \n
I cannot love Him if I love not you. \n
7 \n
Qui primavera sempre ed ogni frutto. \n
- Dante \n
Ragionando con meco ed io con lui. \n
- Petrarca \n
"Love me, for I love you"--and answer me, \n
"Love me, for I love you"--so shall we stand \n
As happy equals in the flowering land \n
Of love, that knows not a dividing sea. \n
Love builds the house on rock and not on sand, \n
Love laughs what while the winds rave desperately; \n
And who hath found love's citadel unmann'd? \n
And who hath held in bonds love's liberty? \n
My heart's a coward though my words are brave \n
We meet so seldom, yet we surely part \n
So often; there's a problem for your art! \n
Still I find comfort in his Book, who saith, \n
Though jealousy be cruel as the grave, \n
And death be strong, yet love is strong as death. \n
8 \n
Come dicesse a Dio: D'altro non calme. \n
- Dante \n
Spero trovar pietà non che perdono. \n
- Petrarca \n
"I, if I perish, perish"--Esther spake: \n
And bride of life or death she made her fair \n
In all the lustre of her perfum'd hair \n
And smiles that kindle longing but to slake. \n
She put on pomp of loveliness, to take \n
Her husband through his eyes at unaware; \n
She spread abroad her beauty for a snare, \n
Harmless as doves and subtle as a snake. \n
She trapp'd him with one mesh of silken hair, \n
She vanquish'd him by wisdom of her wit, \n
And built her people's house that it should stand:-- \n
If I might take my life so in my hand, \n
And for my love to Love put up my prayer, \n
And for love's sake by Love be granted it! \n
9 \n
O dignitosa coscienza e netta! \n
- Dante \n
Spirto più acceso di virtuti ardenti. \n
- Petrarca \n
Thinking of you, and all that was, and all \n
That might have been and now can never be, \n
I feel your honour'd excellence, and see \n
Myself unworthy of the happier call: \n
For woe is me who walk so apt to fall, \n
So apt to shrink afraid, so apt to flee, \n
Apt to lie down and die (ah, woe is me!) \n
Faithless and hopeless turning to the wall. \n
And yet not hopeless quite nor faithless quite, \n
Because not loveless; love may toil all night, \n
But take at morning; wrestle till the break \n
Of day, but then wield power with God and man:-- \n
So take I heart of grace as best I can, \n
Ready to spend and be spent for your sake. \n
10 \n
Con miglior corso e con migliore stella. \n
- Dante \n
La vita fugge e non s'arresta un' ora. \n
- Petrarca \n
Time flies, hope flags, life plies a wearied wing; \n
Death following hard on life gains ground apace; \n
Faith runs with each and rears an eager face, \n
Outruns the rest, makes light of everything, \n
Spurns earth, and still finds breath to pray and sing; \n
While love ahead of all uplifts his praise, \n
Still asks for grace and still gives thanks for grace, \n
Content with all day brings and night will bring. \n
Life wanes; and when love folds his wings above \n
Tired hope, and less we feel his conscious pulse, \n
Let us go fall asleep, dear friend, in peace: \n
A little while, and age and sorrow cease; \n
A little while, and life reborn annuls \n
Loss and decay and death, and all is love. \n
11 \n
Vien dietro a me e lascia dir le genti. \n
- Dante \n
Contando i casi della vita nostra. \n
- Petrarca \n
Many in aftertimes will say of you \n
"He lov'd her"--while of me what will they say? \n
Not that I lov'd you more than just in play, \n
For fashion's sake as idle women do. \n
Even let them prate; who know not what we knew \n
Of love and parting in exceeding pain, \n
Of parting hopeless here to meet again, \n
Hopeless on earth, and heaven is out of view. \n
But by my heart of love laid bare to you, \n
My love that you can make not void nor vain, \n
Love that foregoes you but to claim anew \n
Beyond this passage of the gate of death, \n
I charge you at the Judgment make it plain \n
My love of you was life and not a breath. \n
12 \n
Amor, che ne la mente mi ragiona. \n
- Dante \n
Amor vien nel bel viso di costei. \n
- Petrarca \n
If there be any one can take my place \n
And make you happy whom I grieve to grieve, \n
Think not that I can grudge it, but believe \n
I do commend you to that nobler grace, \n
That readier wit than mine, that sweeter face; \n
Yea, since your riches make me rich, conceive \n
I too am crown'd, while bridal crowns I weave, \n
And thread the bridal dance with jocund pace. \n
For if I did not love you, it might be \n
That I should grudge you some one dear delight; \n
But since the heart is yours that was mine own, \n
Your pleasure is my pleasure, right my right, \n
Your honourable freedom makes me free, \n
And you companion'd I am not alone. \n
13 \n
E drizzeremo gli occhi al Primo Amore. \n
- Dante \n
Ma trovo peso non da le mie braccia. \n
- Petrarca \n
If I could trust mine own self with your fate, \n
Shall I not rather trust it in God's hand? \n
Without Whose Will one lily doth not stand, \n
Nor sparrow fall at his appointed date; \n
Who numbereth the innumerable sand, \n
Who weighs the wind and water with a weight, \n
To Whom the world is neither small nor great, \n
Whose knowledge foreknew every plan we plann'd. \n
Searching my heart for all that touches you, \n
I find there only love and love's goodwill \n
Helpless to help and impotent to do, \n
Of understanding dull, of sight most dim; \n
And therefore I commend you back to Him \n
Whose love your love's capacity can fill. \n
14 \n
E la Sua Volontade è nostra pace. \n
- Dante \n
Sol con questi pensier, con altre chiome. \n
- Petrarca \n
Youth gone, and beauty gone if ever there \n
Dwelt beauty in so poor a face as this; \n
Youth gone and beauty, what remains of bliss? \n
I will not bind fresh roses in my hair, \n
To shame a cheek at best but little fair,-- \n
Leave youth his roses, who can bear a thorn,-- \n
I will not seek for blossoms anywhere, \n
Except such common flowers as blow with corn. \n
Youth gone and beauty gone, what doth remain? \n
The longing of a heart pent up forlorn, \n
A silent heart whose silence loves and longs; \n
The silence of a heart which sang its songs \n
While youth and beauty made a summer morn, \n
Silence of love that cannot sing again. \n<|endoftext|>
sonnet \n
Like as, to make our appetites more keen, \n
With eager compounds we our palate urge, \n
As, to prevent our maladies unseen, \n
We sicken to shun sickness when we purge, \n
Even so, being tuff of your ne'er-cloying sweetness, \n
To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding \n
And, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness \n
To be diseased ere that there was true needing. \n
Thus policy in love, to anticipate \n
The ills that were not, grew to faults assured \n
And brought to medicine a healthful state \n
Which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cured: \n
But thence I learn, and find the lesson true, \n
Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you. \n<|endoftext|>
sonnet \n
Alack, what poverty my Muse brings forth, \n
That having such a scope to show her pride, \n
The argument all bare is of more worth \n

O, blame me not, if I no more can write! \n
Look in your glass, and there appears a face \n
That over-goes my blunt invention quite, \n
Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace. \n
Were it not sinful then, striving to mend, \n
To mar the subject that before was well? \n
For to no other pass my verses tend \n
Than of your graces and your gifts to tell; \n
And more, much more, than in my verse can sit \n
Your own glass shows you when you look in it. \n<|endoftext|>
sonnet \n
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? \n
Thou art more lovely and more temperate: \n
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, \n
And summer's lease hath all too short a date: \n
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, \n
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd; \n
And every fair from fair sometime declines, \n
By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd; \n
But thy eternal summer shall not fade \n
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest; \n
Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade, \n
When in eternal lines to time thou growest: \n
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see, \n
So long lives this and this gives life to thee. \n<|endoftext|>
sonnet \n
Yet, love, mere love, is beautiful indeed \n
And worthy of acceptation. Fire is bright, \n
Let temple burn, or flax; an equal light \n
Leaps in the flame from cedar-plank or weed: \n
And love is fire. And when I say at need \n
I love thee \n
...mark!... \n
I love thee \n
--in thy sight \n
I stand transfigured, glorified aright, \n
With conscience of the new rays that proceed \n
Out of my face toward thine. There's nothing low \n
In love, when love the lowest: meanest creatures \n
Who love God, God accepts while loving so. \n
And what I \n
feel, \n
across the inferior features \n
Of what I \n
am, \n
doth flash itself, and show \n
How that great work of Love enhances Nature's. \n<|endoftext|>

(Hari-syllabic) (Edited Version) \n
Zoinks! \n
Slowly \n
And gently, \n
Blooms appeared - dressed in \n
Zillion hues, filling \n
The air with spellbinding \n
Aroma. On each bud, a \n
Dewdrop, the pearls jigged in the \n
Bebop. To the tunes of twigs and leaves \n
The blooms discoed, a salsa in the sun. \n
Nature bestows life to the beasts and humans too. \n
Gawk! \n
I chanced \n
To pluck a \n
Rose but, lo, a \n
Spike pricked me for an \n
Attempted murder case \n
As I tried to axe her life \n
Just to please my ducky cute. We \n
Reach flowers to claim their beauty, but \n
Their spirit dies and they mourn when we cut. \n
Nature brings freshness to all but man shocks it - boo \n
Yow! \n
Gardens \n
Are to sport \n
Their splendor in \n
a regal show but, lo, \n
we cut their limbs and sing \n
them a dirge - Violets, Blues, reds \n
and yellows, too have a soul in \n
the meadows. To view is their beauty, \n
to grow plants is our duty, hey mackerel. \n
Otherwise, nature warns man with Tsunamis, boohoo. \n

ars-poetica \n
I wanted to tell the veterinary assistant about the cat video Jason sent me \n
But I resisted for fear she'd think it strange \n
I am very lonely \n
Yesterday my boyfriend called me, drunk again \n
And interspersed between ringing tears and clinginess \n
He screamed at me with a kind of bitterness \n
No other human had before to my ears \n
And told me that I was no good \n
Well maybe he didn't mean that \n
But that is what I heard \n
When he told me my life was not worthwhile \n
And my life's work the work of the elite. \n
I say I want to save the world but really \n
I want to write poems all day \n
I want to rise, write poems, go to sleep, \n
Write poems in my sleep \n
Make my dreams poems \n
Make my body a poem with beautiful clothes \n
I want my face to be a poem \n
I have just learned how to apply \n
Eyeliner to the corners of my eyes to make them appear wide \n
There is a romantic abandon in me always \n
I want to feel the dread for others \n
I can feel it through song \n
Only through song am I able to sum up so many words into a few \n
Like when he said I am no good \n
I am no good \n
Goodness is not the point anymore \n
Holding on to things \n
Now that's the point \n<|endoftext|>

(It's been done. That makes it harder to do.) \n
Don't lock yourself in a room with a word called 'Poetry' - \n
It will breathe all the Oxygen. \n
Instead, recognize that the word is the room. \n
And that room is the world. \n
Don't try to hunt it with bow and spear-point - \n
It will only laugh at you, escaping \n
as the air escapes the clapping man. \n
Instead, laugh with it - \n
and escape with it also. \n
In your anger, don't even try to step on it - \n
it will disappear, but not for the reasons you thought. \n
Do not follow it, neither let it follow you. \n
Instead, be with it. \n
And it will be where it belongs. \n<|endoftext|>

Ars Poetica # 1 \n
A poem should sound meditation \n
In my brain, \n
As I am standing in front of a pole \n
As a mole, \n
Top of which three hands of a clock \n
Whirling quick, \n
It is an ancient and only unit \n
Of counting it; \n
The time of this universe \n
Time of creatures; \n
One after another the three hands \n
Count of happening things, \n
When start a thing and a being \n
Again end in time, \n
When did I come in this earth? \n
Instantly it wrote; \n
How much time the earth takes \n
To move once, \n
Around itself and the sun \n
At how motion, \n
From the creation of this universe \n
Time has been prose and verse \n
To the creations and the creatures \n
To complete course. \n

ars-poetica \n
—Detroit, Michigan \n
Broad-ribbed leaves of the calathea plant \n
trickle water down into the mouth of its pot \n
as if it's still fighting off competitors in the wild \n
as kittens scamper past, the knees of their \n
hind legs bending backwards with inhuman \n
ease, like teenage boys leaping for rebounds \n
on playgrounds, their hourglass sleekness \n
glistening like the shards of forty-ounces \n
littering the court: sons of southern \n
autoworkers still unfamiliar with the Michigan \n
that has taken them in, girls watching \n
from windows as they care for the children \n
of older sisters. The act of wanting offers \n
only the hope of movement, for every target \n
an aim, lives spent in the in-between, \n
multitudes of coexisting in this particular filament \n
as if no other were possible—American engines \n
turning in a summertime traffic jam, white clouds \n
from factories as if shift whistles sent them forth: \n
the mind propelled by possibility and promise, \n
an unbreakable stasis. The person who wanted us \n
has come and gone several times like a tulip \n
bulb's inhaled and exhaled lives: desire, \n
the seed itself, creating. See what others \n
see in us, that gem which no one owns, \n
our skin a concept, a bloom of imagination \n
like one's own yearning unfulfilled—unchecked \n
as poison ivy, the fumes of its combustion \n
more dangerous than the vine ignored. \n
Boys want shots to drop. Girls want \n
what's through the window, not anything \n
close by or far afield, just the usual. \n
Cat-backed Swedish and German automobiles \n
scoot down the boulevard, someone \n
else's barbecue cooking across the street. \n
Desire never lies beyond what's given. \n
I have hated the second-hand world. Who was \n
that person divided between the glances of passersby? \n
Bodies decompose, even in memory— \n
the hand-in-hand of melted hourglass, \n
bloody hips of gifted tulips detached \n
and traveling the earth, until the mind \n
puts an end to them like breakers \n
washing out to sea. "Fine neighbors,' \n
someone will say. "Quiet types,' \n
because no one really knew them \n
until the press run. Packing kernels inundate \n
the universe: far off, coalescence; close in, \n
vibration and sparking. Upon \n
each smooth surface, each body, \n
Picasso portraits, light and dark. \n<|endoftext|>

Woven words, cascading \n
down slopes of rhyme, \n
through jungles of cadence \n

and become translucent \n
phosphorescent \n
celestial and lyrical \n
and eternal \n
immortal \n
Every keystroke fires \n
across webs of wire \n
fiber optic fantasy \n
burning nocturnes \n

tears, and collapse \n
into the radiant world \n

ineffable realm of lucidity, \n

Although she understood what it meant to be him \n
She saw earlier than he did what it was to lose everything \n
And so she tried to bury all that was within her \n
She threw it into the lagoon \n
Dug holes beneath coconut trees \n
But palms don’t sit deep enough \n
And the tide brought everything back \n
She’d try to attend to it \n
In secret, behind a closed door \n
With music loud and images moving \n
But instead of keeping it all as some kind of manageable \n
Mass it grew, nurtured by the privation of light \n
Although she understood what it meant to be him \n
She asked for photographs of happy days \n
Of the conventional, as if this might reinforce some sense of normality \n
But he gave her scans of his brain \n
X-rays of his head \n
A spectral reminder of what they both shared \n
His feint facial contours wrapped around bone \n
Missing and replaced teeth testament to \n
Age and gnawing life through flesh her own teeth breaking \n
There was no escape from the emergent sense \n
Of fight within her \n
Although she understood what it meant to be him \n
Most of what she wanted to become \n
Involved her leaving traces of him \n
Behind her on the one road between the houses \n
Scatterings of genealogy marking the \n
Bends delineating which side \n
On which to drive \n
She was always confused as to which side was the right side \n
When the wind was pushing across her face her bones her brain \n
Scanned with her eyes to see if all the \n
Parts had fallen and if she was free \n
There is no escape from the DNA of creation \n<|endoftext|>

Mendacem oporrer esse memorem. \n
Poets should read that: it applies to them, \n
It fits my metre, and it hits the mark. \n
To act on it, of course, requires pluck. \n
It means (translated freely I admit): \n
‘Lie, poet, lie; but don’t be caught at it.’ \n
Liars are all lame ducks and often slip, \n
And once a poem slips it can’t get up. \n
Though manners, morals, are at one, decrying \n
The gross impurity of common lying, \n
Poets must specialise in the depiction \n
Of highly-coloured worlds that are pure fiction. \n
Do not, indeed, the very heavens lie \n
Above us? Oh, the innocent blue sky! \n
Is the sun really haloed? Does he rise \n
And run above us? When we lionise \n
Leonids, aren’t we bluffed? And then the blue \n
Of distant mountain, forest - is that true? \n
Does not the rainbow’s bridge pile guile on guile? \n
And are horizons really there at all? \n
The fata morgana, when it shows to you \n
A lake with trees and steeples cut in two, \n
Tops hovering, the other halves reversed – \n
Doesn’t this cheat your sight and cheat your thirst? \n
So all things bright and beautiful are lies. \n
The truth’s a skeleton, not very nice. \n
Please, poet, cover it with flesh and blood; \n
Lie, poet, lie: it is your livelihood. \n
If you convince me that what seems is there, \n
You’re a true poet though a perjurer. \n
He was no shyster, that Athenian \n
Who squealed as piglets squeal; the other one, \n
The peasant with a real pig in his coat, \n
Might make his real pig cry, might fleer and flout \n
Our sound-effects man all he liked, but earned \n
Loud boos and hisses from the people round. \n
They felt that - while the pig-impersonator \n
Sounded as pigs do sound - the genuine creature \n
(Real piggy flesh and blood, sheer pig right through) \n
Squealed nonetheless as piglets seldom do … \n<|endoftext|>

I met my Muse \n
In last night's dream! \n
It's not a 'he' or a 'she' \n
Seems it's a team! \n
I always thought it was some dead poet \n
With a yen to express.... \n
...With artistic sensibilities........ \n
And a need to still show it. \n
But what I dreamed was.... \n
A baseball team, (9) , \n
Even some back benchers, \n
Second stringers, relief pitchers, \n
In short, a small crowd. \n
A motley crew, (laugh out loud) , \n
Tossing out suggestions. \n
Still dreaming, I took them for a test drive: \n
I asked, How shall I say, 'You are a sight for sore eyes? ' \n
'Northern Lights, ' came the pitch, \n
'Compared to grey skies.' \n
(Not Aurora Borealis, we were all in agreement, \n
Too grand for the emotion of \n
'I'm happy to see you.') \n
So...... do they hang around \n
Waiting for my mind to settle \n
On wanting to communicate \n
Some idea I've just thought of.......? \n
Or, are they the ones \n
Who direct my attention \n
To the idea itself? \n
A guidance from above? \n
And I wonder what's the best way \n
To engage with my team. \n
Oh! ! ! ! ......I guess that's actually an easy call, \n
I'll simply announce \n
In a stentorian voice: \n
Plaaaaaaay......... ball! ! \n<|endoftext|>

BUTTERFLY \n
As born with Spring, with roses born away, \n
Breasting breeze’s wing to swing on high, \n
Upon bright buds’ breasts balanced, trembling play, \n
To drink and drown in perfume, light and sky. \n
To dust wings’ powder while still young and spry; \n
Earth flee, fly like a sigh the Milky Way, - \n
Rare fate, enchanted, of the Butterfly! \n

Loving all things, who none may satisfy, \n
Yearn ecstasy? - then seek in Heaven, .... good-bye! \n

Naître avec le printemps, mourir avec les roses, \n
Sur l’aile du zéphyr nager dans un ciel pur; \n
Balancé sur le sein des fleurs à peine écloses, \n
S’enivrer de parfums, de lumière et d’azur; \n
Secouant, jeune encor, la poudre de ses ailes, \n
S’envoler comme un souffle aux voûtes éternelles; \n
Voilà du papillon le destin enchanté: \n
Il ressemble au désir, qui jamais ne se pose, \n
Et sans se satisfaire, effleurant toute chose, \n
Retourne enfin au ciel chercher la volupté. \n

The merchant bows unto the seaman's star, \n
The ploughman from the sun his season takes, \n

Awake, awake! break thro' your veils of lawn! \n

You continue to wonder in absolute awe \n
While prolonging whispers of lover's musical breeze \n
That embraces The Spring and welcomes Winter's thaw \n

Filling all nature and you with serene \n

It's chilly. Behind the blind (if we could view it) \n
the sky's a murky midnight blue \n
and cirrhus-streaked, with few \n
if any, stars shining through it; \n
till on comes the yellow-pink dispute \n

that even the tightest lid cannot refute, \n
and with surprising logic, light outreasons \n
dark.Through the dusty louvers the sun tries \n
its lever of incandescent light. \n
Between my lids it pries and pries \n
urging Awaken! , or, if you prefer, Get up! \n
Eyed wide, one could see it hurtling in at \n
well, just the speed of light, but shut \n
one can feel its pulse, nevertheless, for as gas has mass, \n
Light definitely has heft, \n
and at my lids, like a jilted friend \n
or a creditor, raps and raps. Where \n
is it now, my dream, warmly affable, that lately \n
swang (astride its hippogriff) me from the rainbow's end \n
to fields Elysian; and that, offended, \n
dove back down its cloudy burrow \n
Gone like a weasel's tail, like the bluish snake, that long ago \n
upon a certain hour, swam between my feet \n
and beyond, trembling the unkempt lawn. \n
Where is that dream I need to recall \n
to share with therapist, friend, or \n
anyone wishing to hear and share? \n
Gone, gone, and gone \n
as when in the pre-dawn air \n
potter's pictures, jostled, disappear- \n
shattering the pot with the potter. \n<|endoftext|>

Hymn For Earning And Imparting Knowledge (Refrain In Aubade) \n
Deep darkness suppresses all lights \n
Frightens the existence, \n
But the fair souls glint \n
White rays come out, \n
Gradually white rays turn into red to raise lives around, \n
Soon the birds start singing, \n
Trees begin blossoming in breeze \n
Fragrances spread, \n
The surroundings call all, \n
"The sun will rise soon"; \n
Let me get up, o, spouse! \n
See, enlightened the house; \n
I need \n
So much to read! \n
For learning and earning knowledge \n
To remove darkness first from me, \n
Then I should \n
So much to write! So much to teach! ! \n
For imparting knowledge \n
To remove darkness from society; \n
But, sad! So sad! \n
I have so little time! So little time! ! \n
With so many books! So many works! ! \n
Let my lamenting win, \n
Let my shedding tears win, \n
Let me pray to Almighty Allah \n
For sharpening my brain; \n
Sharpening my mind; \n
Sharpening my eyes; \n
Sharpening my whole life. \n

Big sun already, fourth of July; waves \n
of heat creasing vision; scent \n
of magnolia strong-arms the yard; \n
exhausted zinnias buckle under. \n
Huge morning wanders my way, \n
familiar, supple; I know its swathe \n
and waste, its storm-cowl \n

epitaph \n
Ye sacred relics, which your marble keep, \n
Here, undisturbed by wars, in quiet sleep; \n
Discharge the trust, which, when it was below, \n
Fairborne's undaunted soul did undergo, \n
And be the town's palladium from the foe. \n
Alive and dead these walls he will defend: \n
Great actions great examples must attend. \n
The Candian siege his early valour knew, \n
Where Turkish blood did his young hands imbrue. \n
From thence returning with deserved applause, \n
Against the Moors his well-fleshed sword he draws; \n
The same the courage, and the same the cause. \n
His youth and age, his life and death, combine, \n
As in some great and regular design, \n
All of a piece throughout, and all divine. \n
Still nearer heaven his virtues shone more bright, \n
Like rising flames expanding in their height; \n
The martyr's glory crowned the soldier's fight. \n
More bravely British general never fell, \n
Nor general's death was e'er revenged so well; \n
Which his pleased eyes beheld before their close, \n
Followed by thousand victims of his foes. \n
To his lamented loss, for time to come, \n
His pious widow consecrates this tomb. \n<|endoftext|>
epitaph \n
The trees went up the hill \n
And over it. \n
Then the dry grasses of the pasture were \n
Only a kind of blonde light \n
Settling everywhere \n
And framing the randomly strewn \n
Outcropping of gray stone \n
That anchored them to soil. \n
Who were they? \n
One in the picture, & one not, & both \n
Scotch-Irish drifters, \n
With nothing in common but a perfect contempt \n
for a past; \n
Ancestors of stumps & fallen trees & . . . . \n
One sits on a sorrel mare, \n
Idly tossing small stones at the rump \n
of a steer \n
That goes on grazing at tough rosettes \n
of pasture grass & switching its tail \n
In what is not yet irritation. \n
What I like, what I \n
Have always liked, is the way he tosses each small \n
Stone without thinking, without \n
A thought for anything, not aiming at all, \n
The easy, arcing forearm nonchalance \n
Like someone fly casting, \n
For this is what \n
He wanted: \n
To be among the stones, the grasses, \n
Savoring a stony self \n
That reminded him of no one else, \n
And on land where that poacher, Law, \n
Had not yet stolen through his fences, \n
The horse beneath him tensing \n
Its withers lightly to keep \n
The summer flies away, \n
And the woman in the flower-print dress hemmed \n
With stains \n
A half mile off \n
Is the authoress of no more than smoke rising, \n
Her sole diary & only publication, \n
From a distant chimney. \n
They have perhaps a year or two \n
Left of this \n
Before history begins to edit them into \n
Something without smoke or flies, something \n
Beyond all recognition. \n<|endoftext|>
epitaph \n
The first time I died, I walked my ways; \n
I followed the file of limping days. \n
I held me tall, with my head flung up, \n
But I dared not look on the new moon's cup. \n
I dared not look on the sweet young rain, \n
And between my ribs was a gleaming pain. \n
The next time I died, they laid me deep. \n
They spoke worn words to hallow my sleep. \n
They tossed me petals, they wreathed me fern, \n
They weighted me down with a marble urn. \n
And I lie here warm, and I lie here dry, \n
And watch the worms slip by, slip by. \n<|endoftext|>

epitaph \n
These are not dew-drops, these are tears, \n
And tears by Sally shed \n
For absent Robin, who she fears \n
With too much cause, is dead. \n
One morn he came not to her hand \n
As he was wont to come, \n
And, on her finger perched, to stand \n
Picking his breakfast-crumb. \n
Alarmed she called him, and perplext \n
She sought him, but in vain; \n
That day he came not, nor the next, \n
Nor ever came again. \n
She therefore raised him here a tomb, \n
Though where he fell, or how, \n
None knows, so secret was his doom, \n
Nor where he moulders now. \n
Had half a score of coxcombs died \n
In social Robin's stead, \n
Poor Sally's tears had soon been dried, \n
Or haply never shed. \n
But Bob was neither rudely bold \n
Nor spiritlessly tame, \n
Nor was, like theirs, his bosom cold, \n
But always in a flame. \n<|endoftext|>
epitaph \n
Thou who survey'st these walls with curious eye, \n
Pause at this tomb where Hanmer's ashes lie; \n
His various worth through varied life attend, \n
And learn his virtues while thou mourn'st his end. \n
His force of genius burn'd in early youth, \n
With thirst of knowledge, and with love of truth; \n
His learning, joined with each endearing art, \n
Charm'd every ear, and gain'd every heart. \n
Thus early wise, the endanger'd real to aid, \n
His country call'd him from the studious shade; \n
In life's first bloom his public toils began, \n
At once commenced the senator and man. \n
In business dexterous, weighty in debate, \n
Thrice ten long years he labour'd for the state; \n
In every speech persuasive wisdom flow'd, \n
In every act refulgent virtue glow'd; \n
Suspended faction ceased from rage and strife, \n
To hear his eloquence, and praise his life. \n
Resistless merit fix'd the senate's choice, \n
Who hail'd him Speaker with united voice. \n
Illustrious age! how bright thy glories shone, \n
When Hanmer fill'd the chair - and Anne the throne. \n
Then when dark art obscured each fierce debate, \n
When mutual frauds perplex'd the maze of state, \n
The Moderator firmly mild appear'd - \n
Beheld with love - with veneration heard. \n
This task perform'd - he sought no gainful post \n
Nor wish'd to glitter at his country's cost; \n
Strict on the right he fix'd his stedfast eye, \n
With temperate zeal, and wise anxiety; \n
Nor e'er from Virtue's paths was lured aside, \n
To pluck the flowers of pleasure or of pride. \n
Her gifts despis'd, Corruption blush'd and fled, \n
And Fame pursued him where Conviction led. \n
Age call'd, at length, his active mind to rest, \n
With honour sated, and with cares oppress'd; \n
To letter'd ease retired and honest mirth, \n
To rural grandeur, and domestic worth: \n
Delighted still to please mankind, or mend, \n
The patriot's fire yet sparkled in the friend. \n
Calm Conscience then, his former life survey'd, \n
And recollected toils endeared the shade, \n
Till Nature call'd him to the general doom, \n
And Virtue's sorrow dignified his tomb. \n<|endoftext|>

Farewell Example, Living Rule farewell; \n

In whose all-conquering tong true right was Fate; \n
That could not pleade among the grounded throng \n
Wrong Causes right nor rightfull causes wrong, \n
But made the burnish'd Truth to shine more bright \n
Than could the witnesses or Act in sight. \n
Who did soe breifely, soe perspicuously \n
Untie the knots of darke perplexity \n
That words appear'd like thoughts, and might derive \n

Outwent the Journey's Ende where others stay: \n

Let no profane ignoble foot tread neer \n
This hallow'd peece of earth, Dorset lies here. \n
A small sad relique of a noble spirit, \n
Free as the air, and ample as his merit; \n
Whose least perfection was large, and great \n
Enough to make a common man compleat. \n

Using both well. No proud forgetting Lord, \n
But mindful of mean names and of his word. \n
One that did love for honour, not for ends, \n
And had the noblest way of making friends \n
By loving first. One that did know the Court, \n
Yet understood it better by report \n

But the kings favour for his recompence. \n
One for religion, or his countreys good \n
That valu'd not his Fortune nor his blood. \n
One high in fair opinion, rich in praise; \n
And full of all we could have wisht, but dayes. \n

Could tears retard the tyrant in his course; \n
Could sighs avert his dart's relentless force; \n
Could youth and virtue claim a short delay, \n
Or beauty charm the spectre from his prey; \n
Thou still hadst lived to bless my aching sight, \n
Thy comrade's honour and thy friends delight. \n
If yet thy gentle spirit hover nigh \n
The spot where now thy mouldering ashes lie, \n
Here wilt thou read, recorded on my heart, \n
A grief too deep to trust the sculptor's art. \n
No marble marks thy couch of lowly sleep, \n
But living statues there are seen to weep; \n
Affliction's semblance bands not o'er thy tomb, \n
Affliction's self deplores thy youthful doom. \n
What though thy sire lament his failing line, \n
A father's sorrows cannot equal mine! \n
Though none, like thee, his dying hour will cheer, \n
Yet other offspring soothe his anguish here: \n
But who with me shall hold thy former place? \n
Thine image what new friendship can efface? \n
Ah, none! - a father's tears will cease to flow, \n

This is the church which Pisa, great and free, \n
Reared to St. Catharine. How the time-stained walls, \n
That earthquakes shook not from their poise, appear \n
To shiver in the deep and voluble tones \n
Rolled from the organ! Underneath my feet \n
There lies the lid of a sepulchral vault. \n
The image of an armed knight is graven \n
Upon it, clad in perfect panoply-- \n
Cuishes, and greaves, and cuirass, with barred helm, \n
Gauntleted hand, and sword, and blazoned shield. \n
Around, in Gothic characters, worn dim \n
By feet of worshippers, are traced his name, \n
And birth, and death, and words of eulogy. \n
Why should I pore upon them? This old tomb, \n
This effigy, the strange disused form \n
Of this inscription, eloquently show \n
His history. Let me clothe in fitting words \n
The thoughts they breathe, and frame his epitaph. \n
'He whose forgotten dust for centuries \n
Has lain beneath this stone, was one in whom \n
Adventure, and endurance, and emprise \n
Exalted the mind's faculties and strung \n
The body's sinews. Brave he was in fight, \n
Courteous in banquet, scornful of repose, \n
And bountiful, and cruel, and devout, \n
And quick to draw the sword in private feud. \n
He pushed his quarrels to the death, yet prayed \n
The saints as fervently on bended knees \n
As ever shaven cenobite. He loved \n
As fiercely as he fought. He would have borne \n
The maid that pleased him from her bower by night, \n
To his hill-castle, as the eagle bears \n
His victim from the fold, and rolled the rocks \n
On his pursuers. He aspired to see \n
His native Pisa queen and arbitress \n
Of cities: earnestly for her he raised \n
His voice in council, and affronted death \n
In battle-field, and climbed the galley's deck, \n
And brought the captured flag of Genoa back, \n
Or piled upon the Arno's crowded quay \n
The glittering spoils of the tamed Saracen. \n
He was not born to brook the stranger's yoke, \n
But would have joined the exiles that withdrew \n
For ever, when the Florentine broke in \n
The gates of Pisa, and bore off the bolts \n
For trophies--but he died before that day. \n
'He lived, the impersonation of an age \n
That never shall return. His soul of fire \n
Was kindled by the breath of the rude time \n
He lived in. Now a gentler race succeeds, \n
Shuddering at blood; the effeminate cavalier, \n
Turning his eyes from the reproachful past, \n
And from the hopeless future, gives to ease, \n
And love, and music, his inglorious life.' \n<|endoftext|>

Dear son of Memory, great heir of Fame, \n
What need'st thou such weak witness of thy name? \n
Thou in our wonder and astonishment \n
Hast built thy self a livelong monument. \n
For whilst, to th' shame of slow-endeavoring art, \n
Thy easy numbers flow, and that each heart \n
Hath from the leaves of thy unvalued book \n
Those Delphic lines with deep impression took, \n

Can't with Hermes Seal resist \n
The powerful spirit's subtler flight, \n
But t'will bid him long good night. \n
And so the Sun if it arise \n
Half so glorious as his Eyes, \n
Like this Infant, takes a shrowd, \n
Buried in a morning Cloud. \n<|endoftext|>
epitaph \n
Tears flow, and cease not, where the good man lies, \n
Till all who know him follow to the skies. \n
Tears therefore fall where Chester's ashes sleep; \n
Him wife, friends, brothers, children, servants, weep; \n
And justly -- few shall ever him transcend \n
As husband, parent, brother, master, friend. \n<|endoftext|>
epitaph \n
Here lies one who never drew \n
Blood himself, yet many slew; \n
Gave the gun its aim, and figure \n
Made in field, yet ne'er pulled trigger. \n
Armed men have gladly made \n
Him their guide, and him obeyed; \n
At his signified desire, \n
Would advance, present, and fire. \n
Stout he was, and large of limb, \n
Scores have fled at sight of him; \n
And to all his fame he rose \n
Only following his nose. \n
Neptune was he called; not he \n
Who controls the boisterous sea. \n
But of happier command, \n
Neptune of the furrowed land; \n
And, your wonder vain to shorten, \n
Pointer to Sir John Throckmorton. \n<|endoftext|>
epitaph \n
U.S. Troops Killed in Iraq. March 2003 to May 2007 \n
You did your duty, \n
And paid the ultimate price. \n
Never forgotten, \n
Missed so much by your loved ones. \n
In Gods tender care today. \n

terza-rima \n
In each year season changes one after another \n
Change its color, beauty, smell and ceremony \n
I pass on and on and more quickly forever; \n
I pass through winter, summer, cold, hot, rainy \n
In autumn I see how nature takes a movement! \n
In spring I see how nature becomes so funny! \n
In each season nature and its inhabitants get \n
New arrangement of being, doing and feeling \n
They usually gain something new and lose old; \n
Sometimes they praise highly of me well calling \n
Sometimes sadly they lament and too scold me \n
I hear them all but usually I have to do nothing; \n
Day after day and year after year I am only me \n
Things and beings will go out I have only to see. \n

terza-rima \n
Among the aspens, golden hills \n
the life I live; I left behind \n
to walk among the mountain rills \n
beneath the coolness of the trees \n
not knowing next what I would find \n
I took rest in the Autumn breeze \n
the mountains high, the sky so blue \n
displaying Nature's grand design \n
I watched the ever changing sights \n
the beaver's splash, the eagle's dive \n
the spotted fawn within the blind \n
a time to cherish, feel alive \n
some beauty lasts but for a day \n
leaves drop before their falling time \n
a flower's fragrance drifts away \n
but days like these, in mem'ry stay \n
from Nature's offering I gleaned \n
a thousand nights of peaceful dreams. \n<|endoftext|>
terza-rima \n
I had some land in the city's suburbs \n
beside a pond with ferns, fishes and ducks \n
amidst a beautiful jungle of shrubs! \n
I sold it for pittance and spent the bucks. \n
Really, it was no deal willy-nilly. \n
Happy we were at that, as dough of luck. \n
The site is now city's central alley \n
with shopping malls and sky scrapers around \n
its worth in crores, mocking at my folly. \n
"Before you sold, should have had thoughts second! " \n
My friend once grieved, "A fool you are my pal. \n
You failed to make an option wise and sound! " \n
"You're right my friend", I laughed, "It was my fall. \n
I should have saved that piece of land or some \n
to spend on doctors' bills, drug stores, et al! " \n
Surprised he asked, "You look alright! Buxom! \n
Never saw you gulping syrups and pills \n
and consulting medics in your life time! " \n
"I made a choice that well suited my bill! " \n
I drawled, "Between a sail by the wind falls \n
and life serene; the body in fine fettle! " \n<|endoftext|>
terza-rima \n
I pray, although it's the end of the time, \n
The angel wakes up to flutter his wings. \n
Fluffing up the cloud's pillow, he's sublime. \n
Snowflakes are the angel's feathers, like spring. \n
They dance with the wind of change, in despair. \n
The sky glows pinky in the shades of thing. \n
We're like icy trees screaming at the air, \n
With icy leaves and crystal hearts, we dream \n
Crystals of weeping tears in our prayer. \n
Within sky vastness is our bleeding scream, \n
Digging early graves in the war on crime, \n
While our thread of love weaves wounds for life's gleam. \n
I pray, although it's the end of the time, \n
Fluffing up the cloud's pillow, he's sublime. \n<|endoftext|>

Wonderful Birds Flamingo (Chance Operations) \n
February 13, 2019 \n
Flamingo, a large colorful bird \n
In South America and Africa well found \n
In the warmer areas of southern Europe and western Asia is also seen \n
Yet it is not an uncommon bird \n
Phoenicopteridae is its scientific name; \n
It stays in flocks of up to around 200 birds \n
Feeds on fish in stiller rivers and lakes \n
It normally gets to about 30 years old \n
Some also get 50 years; \n
Most species of flamingo are a pinky/orange colour, \n
Some however can be white, black or even blue. \n
The colour of the flamingo comes from \n
The flamingo eating a type of algae that Then turns the flamingo into the bright pink birdthat \n
We are so familiar with. \n
The flamingo is often seen on the banks of the lake \n
Standing on one leg. \n
The flamingo is actually sleeping \n
When it is on one leg but the strange thing is \n
That only half of the flamingo is actually asleep \n
The half that contains the leg still standing remains active. \n
The flamingo then swaps over \n
So that the remaining side can get some rest and The side that was sleeping becomes active again. \n
There are six different species of flamingo found around the world. \n
The different flamingo species are the greater flamingo \n
Which is the most widespread species of flamingo \n
Found in Africa, Southern Europe and Southern Asia. \n
The lesser flamingo is the most numerous species \n
Of flamingo and is found in Africa and Northern India. \n
The Chilean flamingo is a large species of flamingo that is found in South America. \n
The James's flamingo is a small and delicate species of flamingo \n
That is found in the Andes mountains in Peru, \n
Chile, Bolivia and Argentina. \n
The Andean flamingo is closely related to the James's flamingo \n
And is also found in the Andes mountains in Peru, Chile, Bolivia \n
And Argentina. \n
The American flamingo is a large species of flamingo that is found in the Caribbean islands and the Galapagos islands. \n
Flamingos use their large, \n
Oddly shaped beaks to filter shrimp out of the water. \n
The flamingo uses it's strangely shaped upside-down beak to separate mud and food in the water. \n
The mouth of the flamingo is covered in little hairs called lamellae \n
Which assist in the filtering of water and the flamingo \n
Also has a rough tongue \n
Which the flamingo also uses to help it to filter food \n
Out of the water. \n
Although flamingos only nest once a year, \n
Flamingo colonies are known to breed at any time of the year. \n
A flamingo reaches sexual maturity \n
Which means the flamingo is able to breed \n
When the flamingo is between 3 and 6 years old \n
Flamingos build their nests out of mud, stones \n
And feathers and do so about 6 weeks before they lay their eggs. \n
Flamingos tend to lay just one egg \n
That hatches after a 30 day incubation period. Both the mother flamingo and the father flamingo are known to help \n
To raise the flamingo chick \n
Flamingos have relatively few predators in the wild \n
But this is dependent on the area in which the flamingo inhabits. \n
Human hunters, \n
wild dogs and crocodiles are the main predators \n
Of the flamingo, along with eagles that prey upon the flamingo eggs \n
And vulnerable flamingo chicks. \n
Human beings should protect flamingos for keeping the environment well. \n<|endoftext|>

*anything that acts as a restraint \n
*metal shackles; for hands or legs \n
*a number of similar establishments (stores or restaurants or banks or hotels or theaters)under one ownership \n
*a series of things depending on each other as if linked together; "the chain of command"; "a complicated concatenation of circumstances" \n
*a series of linked atoms (generally in an organic molecule) \n

*connect or arrange into a chain by linking. \n
A Quatrain is a poem consisting of four lines of verse with a specific rhyming scheme. For this contest I am going to ask you to write four stanzas with the rhyme scheme... aaba, bbcb, ccdc, dddd. This is one example of a chain rhyme. \n
The linking together of stanzas by carrying a rhyme over from one stanza to the next. A number of verse forms use chain rhyme as an integral part of their structures. One example is terza rima, which is written in tercets with a rhyming pattern a-b-a, b-c-b, c-d-c. Another is the virelai ancien, which rhymes a-a-b-a-a-b, b-b-c-b-b-c, c-c-d-c-c-d. Other verse forms may also use chain rhyme. For instance, quatrains can be written to the following pattern: a-a-b-a, b-b-c-b, c-c-d-c. \n
Also cane be written with the rhyme schemes, abab, cdcd, efef, ghgh, or any of these rhymes in sevsral stanzas. \n
Also can be composed in one of the following three ways: \n
* Chain Verse is composed: \n
With the last word or syllable of one line repeated \n
in the beginning of the next line. \n
* Chain Verse is composed: \n
In stanza styles, most often written in any number of quatrains. \n
But any stanza form will do, linked by repeating the last word of a stanza \n
as the first word of the next stanza. \n
The repetition of a word from one verse or stanza to the next creates a chain-like link \n
usual rhyme, linking rhyme or alternate rhyme; \n
often syllabic, alternating longer-shorter lines. \n
One example is alternating 8-7-8-7 syllables, \n
the other is alternating 6-5-6-5 syllables per line. \n
* Chain Verse is composed: \n
With the last line of the stanza repeated \n
as the first line of the next stanza; \n
For the readers I included these \n

She vanishes into the crowd, among the misters and misses, \n
Helplessly she tries to escape from the sinister flow \n
Her nights burn with passion, sweet candies and kisses. \n
In vain she pleads for freedom from the demon her foolishness pisses. \n
Painfully she cried as he scratches her open wound and woe \n
Wouldn't someone save her, before life passes by and hisses? \n
Abandoned, she sits in the dark, her days she reminisces; \n
Her sin tattooed across her name like red blood upon white snow, \n
Her nights burn with passion, sweet candies and kisses. \n
Lost in the fever, broken hopes and shattered wishes. \n
Softly her lips tremble, her life is but a show \n
Wouldn't someone save her before life passes by and hisses? \n
Madness poisons her laughter as her emotion sharply dismisses, \n
"Oh Gloria, life's glorious! Isn't it so? " \n
Her nights burn with passion, sweet candies and kisses, \n
Wouldn't someone save her before life passes by and hisses? \n<|endoftext|>

When the autumn does come suddenly, \n

You do remain lovely to me \n
even when old age comes as it aught to be \n
in a world where nothing anymore seems to fit. \n
When the autumn does come suddenly, \n
only the arrival of bare winter I do see \n
and that all things must come to rest do me hit. \n
You do remain lovely to me \n
while nothing is from winter's impact free \n
while life does change slowly bit by bit. \n
When the autumn does come suddenly, \n
life with you in it still seems heavenly \n

One used to say so, reading Fitzgerald, as it happened. \n

Do I still long for my virginity? \n
Fragment 107 \n
I never longed for my virginity. \n
I heard it on the radio after the hurricane. \n
There, in the aftermath, was the voice of a man— \n
once the sweet, screwed-up boy whose hooded, \n
jessed spirit I tried to possess with the ruthlessness \n
I mistook for power. Here he was on NPR, \n
so gentle, so familiar with devastation, \n
his timbre woke the teenage falconer in me \n
who once saw his kindness as weakness, \n
saw a boy as an unfledged goshawk— \n
a creature to trap and be trapped with \n
in darkened mews. I knew the rules: \n
neither of us could sleep until the molting bird \n
grew ravenous enough to take the raw mouse \n
from my hand. Breaking the falcon \n
broke us both, left us scared \n
and less aware of  love than fear. \n<|endoftext|>

The dog and I went camping \n
On a cold wet July day \n
We couldn’t find the camp site \n
Because sat-nav lost our way \n
We pitched the tent in the rain \n
And got inside to huddle \n
Everything damp Oh what a pain \n
A complete and utter muddle \n
I then put fresh dry clothes out \n
And laid them in the tent \n
A wet dog then shook all about \n
So my anger I did vent \n
I unpacked our stove to cook \n
Beans and sausage were nowt to scoff \n
A girl walked by I had to look \n
With the sausages the dog ran off \n
I bedded down for the night \n
With the dog I was still sore \n
Sleep eluded me nothing was right \n
As the dog continued to snore \n
This went on the whole of the week \n
The rain did not stop or relent \n
We packed out gear and did not speak \n
Our energy all but spent \n
This is what camping is all about \n

A crazy quilt of leaves covers the ground, \n
A riot of confetti drifts earthward bound. \n
Summer is over, and summer’s last dawn. \n
Earth, sound your golden trumpets, summer is gone! \n
As I look back over the years, \n
Memories like leaves, dropp down \n
One by one, amid the echo of laughter and the flow of tears. \n
Once, our love lay draped before us, like a colorful gown. \n
But the gown became torn, \n
And you went away, \n
Even though we’d sworn \n
To love each other, through all days. \n
The gown wore thin and crumbled into dust. \n
Yesterday’s gown now tattered and shorn, \n
Quietly blew away in a cold wind’s gust. \n
I saw you today, and I forgot to mourn. \n
Memories, drifting through my mind. \n
I captured a bright golden memory, still pure. \n
A warm, loving memory, that with my heart still binds. \n
At least this shining bit of our love endures. \n
The gown became torn. \n
At our feet shattered promises lay. \n
Yet, perhaps such memories, old and worn, \n
Will make them true in a way. \n
In a swirl of colors, Autumn arrives, \n
And through it, love and beauty will always survive! \n
Cloaked in the wind and bejeweled with rain, \n
Faithful Autumn, forever, gathers brightly gowned summer’s crumbling train. \n<|endoftext|>
quatrain \n
He always was a courageous young man; \n
From his youth he proved himself very brave. \n
His zeal made him not see the corrupt plan, \n
One concocted to send him to the grave. \n
At her every call he jumped into his steed, \n
Shifted the gears, and went the fastest pace. \n
To him he was saving a dame in need, \n
But he was running his own death race. \n
For when she called, she was in comfort’s chair, \n
But pretended to be battered and bruised. \n
She only wanted him caught in her snare, \n
and told tales of times she was abused. \n
This enraged him, and made him seek vengeance. \n
He doubted God, love, and all things good. \n
He picked up hate and lost all reverence. \n
His death began - rooted in her falsehood. \n
Hate was nurtured by this most naïve love. \n
He opted to taste the snake’s venom. \n
He died when he stopped looking above. \n
In death, he stunk like a rotting possum. \n
He became an impassive zombie, \n
Who forgot all he treasured while he grew. \n
This young man desperately sought for glee; \n
What he really needed was life brand new. \n
For his good, he had favor with Angels, \n
Who watched down on him every day. \n
The secret of hope they gladly did tell. \n
It said, “Brother, never forget to pray. \n
It is that which gives divine reason, \n
Allowing you to tell truth from a lie. \n
When you meet with He who made the seasons \n
You gain endless life, and shall never die.” \n
In his lows, Love saw and remembered him, \n
The worms and stench did not cause Love to scorn. \n
Love came and gave again life and a hymn. \n
Love came and gave him hope for the morn. \n

September brings a final burst of sun \n
The harvest is in stacked in barn or shed \n
Mice feed fat faces before they go to bed \n
Or play in the barn to have some fun \n
Cattle are still in the field grazing \n
Calves suckling to get their fill \n

Sheep huddle together in the night \n
Keeping warm in the chilly night air \n

Wisps of grey smoke stirs from a farmhouse \n
Men with flat caps emerge from their sleep \n
The cold of the dawn makes their eyes weep \n
Enter the barn where scurries a mouse \n
The day starts as it always had done \n
Cattle on the hill calves at their side \n
Sheep in the field roaming far and wide \n
And mice in the barn all having fun \n

She whom once did me seek flee away \n

that something did change and she cannot stay \n
as if I have some kind of iniquity \n
while she hides behind a sweet kind of guise \n

comes as a sudden kind of dim surprise \n
as there is much pain in the forsaking \n
and in the morning’s bright new day \n
she does continually want to be free \n
even the kind of music that she plays \n
has a kind of rebellion that I see, \n
when I do touch her, her arm hairs do rise \n
and all of this has me worried and thinking, \n
makes me cry right up to the red sunrise, \n
as there is much pain in the forsaking \n
and I will have her right back if I may \n
but that is not how things are going to be \n
while to another lover she is set to stray, \n
want to make me for her sake feel guilty \n

A weird silence and a hushing whisper \n
In roaring threat that feared his move further \n
Somehow bold and brave he watchful on went \n
There was beauty everywhere all well dealt \n
'But wild in weird silence- who that maker? ' \n
The poet asked aloud in great wonder \n
'Is there a God special for the forest? ' \n
He smelt a war of strife, a hell of freeze \n
As well a music of harmony donned \n

If ever a man knew with every feeling and sense \n

without expecting but honesty as recompense. \n
If ever experiences have been past intense \n

then such love is immeasurable immense \n
and that is the way that with you my love is. \n
If ever a woman was to pure principles true \n

when you came to me in a life full of woe \n
while people did me severally bother, \n
I do long for the two of us to be together \n
and for you my heart do with passion glow \n
together with you I do want to live well \n
and although at a time there had been tears \n
through decades I do you adore, \n
to you daily of my love I will tell \n
I want to be with you through the years \n
as I love you much more than before. \n

(after Arthur Symons) \n
While days and months do come and go, \n
the memories of you do forever remain \n
and you are deep in my heart and brain, \n
intimate and wonderful I do you know, \n
as if with you God did a true blessing bestow \n
and when I am in loneliness and I am in pain, \n
I do think of you and of us again and again, \n
while my busy days do rush to and thro, \n
that your lips do find a way to my heart, \n
with the kind of essence that in a kiss is, \n
where your true love I want to capture \n
and even when we are separate and apart, \n
you do bring me life and you bring me bliss \n
while in my thoughts you do me enrapture \n

glosa \n
He took to reading Chekhov late at night \n
and studied up on Fox Talbot and calotypes. \n
Watched the History Channel, anything \n
on Lincoln or the Civil War, Caligula, \n
who cut off tongues and fucked his sister. \n
After Chekhov, he'd head downstairs, putter \n
with a model plane or pull the lint out \n
of the dryer screen. Sometimes lie fetal \n
on the couch, make toast, unbuttered. \n
How miserable I am, he muttered. \n
Why Chekhov and not Kafka or Conrad? \n
Why Talbot and not Daguerre? Lincoln \n
and not Adams or FDR, John Wilkes Booth \n
and not Leon Czolgosz or Charles Guiteau? \n
Why model planes and not carved decoys \n
in the attic? All the while, he was affable \n
and focused, building a wooden box camera \n
and writing an early history of photography. \n
Grief, like photographs, inerasable. \n
My God, how miserable. \n
I'm thinking back on childhood. He sucked \n
his fingers, not his thumb. He seemed happy \n
but had trouble sleeping, afraid of the dark. \n
Aren't all children afraid of the dark? Only \n
later came the other things, the unspeakable. \n
It reminds me of that deer we hit, the knife \n
my then-husband took to its throat, as men \n
do, letting one brand of suffering cancel out \n
another. That deer was a door to years of grief. \n
And joy gave way to the boredom of everyday life. \n
Chekhov's stories are essentially plotless. \n
Mirsky wrote they are a "biography of a mood," \n
and Chekhov himself hoped to write \n
with the objectivity of a chemist. Bored, \n
he traveled five thousand miles, three thousand \n
in a rickety carriage drawn by horse, \n
to the penal colony on Sakhalin Island. Chekhov, \n
in ill-health, suffering, trotting his way through \n
wilderness toward imprisoned sufferers, all to cross \n
paths with the feeling of irrevocable loss. \n<|endoftext|>

tyburn \n
I Have heard sundry men oft times dispute \n
Of trees, that in one year will twice bear fruit. \n
But if a man note Tyburn, 'will appear, \n
That that's a tree that bears twelve times a year. \n
I muse it should so fruitful be, for why \n
I understand the root of it is dry, \n
It bears no leaf, no bloom, or no bud, \n
The rain that makes it fructify is blood. \n
I further note, the fruit which it produces, \n
Doth seldom serve for profitable uses: \n
Except the skillful Surgeons industry \n
Do make Dissection of Anatomy. \n
It blooms, buds, and bears, all three together, \n
And in one hour, doth live, and die, and wither. \n
Like Sodom Apples, they are in conceit, \n
For touched, they turn to dust and ashes straight. \n
Besides I find this tree hath never been \n
Like other fruit trees, walled or hedged in, \n
But in the highway standing many a year, \n
It never yet was robbed, as I could hear. \n
The reason is apparent to our eyes, \n
That what it bears, are dead commodities: \n
And yet sometimes (such grace to it is given) \n
The dying fruit is well prepared for heaven, \n
And many times a man may gather thence \n
Remorse, devotion, and true penitence. \n
And from that tree, I think more fools ascend \n
To that Celestial joy, which shall never end: \n
I say, more fools from thence to heaven do come, \n
Than from all Churchyards throughout Christendom. \n
The reason is, the bodies are all dead, \n
And all the fools to joy or woe are fled. \n
Perhaps a week, a day, or two, or three, \n
Before they in the Churchyards buried be. \n
But at this Tree, in twinkling of an eye, \n
The soul and body part immediately, \n
There death the fatal parting blow doth strike, \n
And in Churchyards is seldom seen the like. \n
Besides, they are assistant with the alms \n
Of peoples charitable prayers, and Psalms, \n
Which are the wings that lift the hov'ring spirit, \n
By faith, through grace, true glory to inherit. \n
Concerning this dead fruit, I noted it, \n
Instead of paste it's put into a pit, \n
And laid up carefully in any place, \n
Yet worm-eaten it grows in little space. \n
My understanding can by no means frame, \n
To give this Tyburn fruit a fitter name, \n
Than Medlers, for I find that great and small, \n
(To my capacity) are Medlers all. \n
Some say they are Choked pears, and some again \n
Do call them Hearty Chokes, but 'tis most plain, \n
It is a kind of Medler it doth bear, \n
Or else I think it never would come there. \n
Moreover where it grows, I find it true, \n
It often turns the Herb of grace to Rue. \n
Amongst all Pot-herbs growing on the ground, \n
Time is the least respected, I have found, \n
And most abused, and therefore one shall see \n
No branch or bud of it grow near this Tree: \n
For 'tis occasion of man's greatest crime, \n
To turn the use, into abuse, of Time. \n
When passions are let loose without a bridle, \n
Then precious Time is turned to Love and Idle: \n
And that's the chiefest reason I can show, \n
Why fruit so often doth on Tyburn grow. \n
There are inferior Gallows which bear \n
(According to the season) twice a year: \n
And there's a kind of watrish Tree at Wapping, \n
Whereas Sea-thieves or Pirates are catched napping: \n
But Tyburn doth deserve before them all \n
The title and addition capital, \n
Of Arch or great Grand Gallows of our Land, \n
Whilst all the rest like ragged Lackeys stand; \n
It hath (like Luna) full, and change, and quarters, \n
It (like a Merchant) monthly trucks and barters; \n
But all the other Gallows are fit, \n
Like Chapman, or poor Peddlers onto it. \n
Thus Jails and Jailers being here explained, \n
How both are good, and for good use ordained: \n
All sorts of Hanging which I could surmise, \n
I likewise have described before your eyes; \n
And further having showed what Tyburn is, \n
With many more inferior Gallows, \n
My pen from paper with this Prayer doth part, \n
God bless all people from their sins depart. \n<|endoftext|>

O' Lyric Love, half angel and half bird, \n
And all a wonder and a wild desire,- \n
Boldest of hearts that ever braved the sun, \n
Took sanctuary within the holier blue, \n
And sang a kindred soul out to his face,- \n
Yet human at the red-ripe of the heart- \n
When the first summons from the darkling earth \n
Reached thee amid thy chambers, blanched their blue, \n
And bared them of the glory-to drop down, \n
To toil for man, to suffer or to die,- \n
This is the same voice: can thy soul know change? \n
Hail then, and hearken from the realms of help! \n
Never may I commence my song, my due \n
To God who best taught song by gift of thee, \n
Except with bent head and beseeching hand- \n
That still, despite the distance and the dark, \n
What was, again may be; some interchange \n
Of grace, some splendor once thy very thought, \n
Some benediction anciently thy smile: \n
-Never conclude, but raising hand and head \n
Thither where eyes, that cannot reach, yet yearn \n
For all hope, all sustainment, all reward, \n
Their upmost up and on,-so blessing back \n
In those thy realms of help, that heaven thy home, \n
Some whiteness which, I judge, thy face makes proud, \n
Some wanness where, I think, thy foot may fall! \n<|endoftext|>

situation in this time \n
altogether wish to battle \n
all weapon in the world is lifted \n
if no war disaster come \n
when that all losing and ending? \n
we want to live at the quiet sky \n
we want to live at the quiet sky \n
no martial again \n
no blood again \n
disaster come because act of human \n
who not irate if himself is torn? \n
even sky likely seems will curse them \n
but they still love the war \n
we want to populating at the quiet sky \n
we want to populating at the quiet sky \n
no disaster again \n
no dislike again \n
how that can be finished? \n
if war even became hobby \n
to solve many problems \n
I think if like that end of time will come \n
we want to ascend to the quiet sky \n
we want to ascend to the quiet sky \n

lyric \n
I went to pay the bills today \n
and ask them to give me awhile \n
to catch up on the ones \n
way past due right now.. \n
seems like when we pay one \n
anouther one comes due \n
Seems the only things worth living for \n
comes free to me and you... \n
Daddy always told me \n
'that love's a rocky road \n
life is like a field \n
and you reap just what was sowed. \n
He said, don't think it will be easy \n
that ain't reality \n
Cause anything worth getting \n
is whats given to you free'... \n
I'm Daddy's little girl \n
and one mans woman \n
i'm Mommy to the kids running round.. \n
i'm a friend and i'm a lover \n
and i trust God's faith in me \n
we can take the hard times going down \n
yes, we can take the hard times going down.. \n
Grandma left me treasures \n
in a big old ceader chest \n
nothing anyone would want but me \n
old pictures cards and letters \n
her wedding dress and poems \n
poems she wrote back in 1923.. \n
i'm Daddy's little girl \n
and one mans woman \n
i'm mommy to the kids running round \n
i'm a friend and i'm a lover \n
and i trust God's faith in me \n
Yes, we can take the hard times going down.. \n
Yes, we can take the hard times going down. \n

lyric \n
Heartwings beating on a slender thread \n
Brushing softly on my lover’s head \n
As he lies beside me dreaming \n
Of the way he leaves me feeling \n
He’s dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, of our love \n
I’m yearning, yearning, for heaven up above. \n
We both know it cannot last \n
The love we felt has now long past \n
My heart can only bear so much \n
Until it breaks to feel his touch \n
He’s dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, of our love \n
I’m yearning, yearning, for heaven up above. \n
Love for me was a mountain tall \n
To climb it I would give my all \n
For him it was a pleasant game \n
A diversion on his path to fame. \n
He’s dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, of our love \n
I’m yearning, yearning, for heaven up above. \n
And now for him the game is done \n
The moves are made the trophy’s won \n
He can move on to pastures new \n
While I grieve for what was true. \n
He’s dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, of our love \n
I’m yearning, yearning, for heaven up above. \n<|endoftext|>
lyric \n
Akala mo’y nasa tabi mo pa ako, namalaging lumpo walang imik o kibo \n
bagamat alam mo’ng lahat ay nagbabago, nag-iiba, sa daloy ng pangyayari— \n
walang tigil, kinakabahan-kung di pa nayari, Mahal, yariin mo na! \n
Laging nagnanais, nagnanasa, akala mo’y udyok ng katawan, ngunit pag-aari mo ba \n
ang mga bisig na iyan, mukha, suso, vulva, pigi—kanino ba iyan? \n
Halika sa loob ng kulambo, ibulong mo, kumukutob ang tiwalang nawawala. \n
Sa likod nati’y hindi makulay na salamin sa bintana kundi bukas na dungawan— \n
Sapat ba ang isip sa diwa upang malagom ang karanasang walang hanggan? \n
Saang pitak ng laman ilalagak ang sandaling ito na unti-unting lumilipas? \n
Iniakma mong tanggihan (ngunit tanggap sa loob) , di mahulo ang tiyak na hugis, \n
anyo, hubog—hungkag lahat, walang laman—paano maihahayag o makikilala \n
ang damdamin mo kahit di mo man ipagkaila? kung di pa nayari, mangyayari iyan. \n
Mahirap bigyan ng salita o larawan, ituro mo na lamang at sa bigkas ng labi mo \n
nabibigyan-kahulugan ang pumamapanaw di mo man mahipo o masalat- \n
dagling naglalaho—kay bilis, lumilihis—sumpang bunga ng pagluwal at pag-iral. \n
Lumabas ka sa kulambong masukal, Mahal, di maatim na walang kagampan \n
at, di biro, walang kaganapan sa buhay ng bawat nilikha, ng bawat nilalang \n
kaya sikaping lasapin ang aliw ng sandali, salubungin habang naglalaho, pumaparam…. \n
Ngunit, sawimpalad, ito’y ilusyon lamang, malikmatang nakasusulukasok, \n
sapot sa matang dilat sa panginoring nakapaligid, nalilibiran ng samyo’t ganda \n
ng kalikasan- Halina doon sa lilim ng balete kung saan sumumpa, \n
talastas mong walang hiwaga, walang wika ang may bisang magbunyag o magpakita, \n
sa gayo’y ituro mo na lang ang landas—teka, hintay, sinong pumapalakpak? \n
Ipahalata mo lamang kung saan ang lusot, ipahiwatig kung saang lagusan \n
masusumpungan ang pagkatao mong hubad—doon kusang magaganap ang tipan \n
kahit walang kagampan, may ngiti ka namang iniingatan sa likod ng tuwa’t lumbay- \n
Sayang ba, Mahal? kinukutuban—kahit di pa hinog, sunggaban mo na! \n
Magkasaliwang kilos paikot ang umuugnay sa awit ng gabi at ngiti \n
ng madaling-araw, kasaliw ang tunog ng ulilang palad na pumapalakpak sa dilim: \n
Tahimik. Walang imik. Mayuming lumalapag ang mga talulot. Liwanag humahalik. \n<|endoftext|>

Halcyons ye by the flowing sea \n
Waves that warble twitteringly, \n
Circling over the tumbling blue, \n
Dipping your down in its briny dew, \n
Spi-i-iders in corners dim \n
Spi-spi-spinning your fairy film, \n
Shuttles echoing round the room \n
Silver notes of the whistling loom, \n
Where the light-footed dolphin skips \n
Down the wake of the dark-prowed ships, \n
Over the course of the racing steed \n
Where the clustering tendrils breed \n
Grapes to drown dull care in delight, \n
Oh! mother make me a child again just for to-night! \n
I don't exactly see how that last line is to scan, \n
But that's a consideration I leave to our musical man. \n<|endoftext|>

refrain \n
When snow is here, and the trees look weird, \n
And the knuckled twigs are gloved with frost; \n
When the breath congeals in the drover's beard, \n
And the old pathway to the barn is lost; \n
When the rooster's crow is sad to hear, \n
And the stamp of the stabled horse is vain, \n
And the tone of the cow-bell grieves the ear-- \n
O then is the time for a brave refrain! \n
When the gears hang stiff on the harness-peg, \n
And the tallow gleams in frozen streaks; \n
And the old hen stands on a lonesome leg, \n
And the pump sounds hoarse and the handle squeaks; \n
When the woodpile lies in a shrouded heap, \n
And the frost is scratched from the window-pane \n
And anxious eyes from the inside peep-- \n
O then is the time for a brave refrain! \n
When the ax-helve warms at the chimney-jamb, \n
And hob-nailed shoes on the hearth below, \n
And the house-cat curls in a slumber calm, \n
And the eight-day clock ticks loud and slow; \n
When the harsh broom-handle jabs the ceil \n
'Neath the kitchen-loft, and the drowsy brain \n
Sniffs the breath of the morning meal-- \n
O then is the time for a brave refrain! \n
ENVOI \n
When the skillet seethes, and a blubbering hot \n
Tilts the lid of the coffee-pot, \n
And the scent of the buckwheat cake grows plain-- \n
O then is the time for a brave refrain! \n<|endoftext|>

Spring: \n
A hill without a name \n
Veiled in morning mist. \n
The beginning of autumn: \n

Both the same green. \n

Blow: yet still green \n
The chestnut husks. \n
A flash of lightning: \n
Into the gloom \n
Goes the heron's cry. \n

haiku \n
Drinking my tea \n
Without sugar- \n
No difference. \n
The sparrow shits \n
upside down \n
--ah! my brain & eggs \n
Mayan head in a \n
Pacific driftwood bole \n
--Someday I'll live in N.Y. \n
Looking over my shoulder \n
my behind was covered \n
with cherry blossoms. \n
Winter Haiku \n
I didn't know the names \n
of the flowers--now \n
my garden is gone. \n
I slapped the mosquito \n
and missed. \n
What made me do that? \n
Reading haiku \n
I am unhappy, \n
longing for the Nameless. \n
A frog floating \n
in the drugstore jar: \n
summer rain on grey pavements. \n
(after Shiki) \n
On the porch \n
in my shorts; \n
auto lights in the rain. \n
Another year \n
has past-the world \n
is no different. \n
The first thing I looked for \n
in my old garden was \n
The Cherry Tree. \n
My old desk: \n
the first thing I looked for \n
in my house. \n
My early journal: \n
the first thing I found \n
in my old desk. \n
My mother's ghost: \n
the first thing I found \n
in the living room. \n
I quit shaving \n
but the eyes that glanced at me \n
remained in the mirror. \n
The madman \n
emerges from the movies: \n
the street at lunchtime. \n
Cities of boys \n
are in their graves, \n
and in this town... \n
Lying on my side \n
in the void: \n
the breath in my nose. \n
On the fifteenth floor \n
the dog chews a bone- \n
Screech of taxicabs. \n
A hardon in New York, \n
a boy \n
in San Fransisco. \n
The moon over the roof, \n
worms in the garden. \n
I rent this house. \n

Where wast thou, wittol Ward, when hapless fate \n
From these weak arms mine aged grannam tore? \n
These pious arms essay’d too late \n
To drive the dismal phantom from the door. \n
Could not thy healing drop, illustrious quack, \n
Could not thy salutary pill prolong her days, \n
For whom so oft to Marybone, alack! \n
Thy sorrels dragg’d thee, through the worst of ways? \n
Oil-dropping Twickenham did not then detain \n
Thy steps, though tended by the Cambrian maids; \n
Nor the sweet environs of Drury Lane; \n
Nor dusty Pimlico’s embowering shades; \n
Nor Whitehall, by the river’s bank, \n
Beset with rowers dank; \n
Nor where the Exchange pours forth its tawny sons; \n
Nor where, to mix with offal, soil, and blood, \n
Steep Snowhill rolls the sable flood; \n
Nor where the Mint’s contamined kennel runs: \n
Ill doth it now beseem, \n
That thou should’st doze and dream, \n
When Death in mortal armour came, \n
And struck with ruthless dart the gentle dame. \n
Her liberal hand and sympathising breast \n
The brute creation kindly bless’d; \n
Where’er she trod, grimalkin purr’d around, \n
The squeaking pigs her bounty own’d; \n
Nor to the waddling duck or gabbling goose \n
Did she glad sustenance refuse; \n
The strutting cock she daily fed, \n
And turkey with his snout so red; \n
Of chickens careful as the pious hen, \n
Nor did she overlook the tom-tit or the wren, \n
While red-breast hopp’d before her in the hall, \n
As if she common mother were of all. \n
For my distracted mind, \n
What comfort can I find; \n
O best of grannams! thou art dead and gone, \n
And I am left behind to weep and moan, \n
To sing thy dirge in sad and funeral lay, \n
Oh! woe is me! alack! and well a-day! \n<|endoftext|>

In every walk of life politician is present, \n
Politics, they say has become omnipresent. \n
Espoused with the motto of the betterment \n
Of deprieved classes-their life, s improvement. \n
Deceit has been made synonym of politics \n
By the mushroomimg growth of opportunists. \n
To the deception they nicknamed governance \n
Ditching worthy they came into prominance. \n
Master craftsmen they are of coining slogans, \n
Alluring they may be but full of deception. \n
When they voice demand of womens reservations, \n
From inflation they divert every one's attention. \n
Campaign they launch about India Shining. \n
Using motley media just for the fooling \n
Of the common man, their targeted victim, \n
For which they may go to any extreme. \n
Remove poverty slogan, they coined once \n
Steps were then taken not to give any chance \n
to pull on life, to the poor, with contentment. \n
Hidden agenda was from life his externment. \n
Politics is last resort of goons, some one said, \n
How right he was our politicins have proved. \n<|endoftext|>

narrative \n
An awareness spread through the ranks \n
of the horses, that their ordeal was over, \n
that life in a pasture with sweet grass, \n
clear streams, and room to roam, was soon \n
to resume. They know nothing of Victory \n
or Defeat, they only know kind treatment \n
or harsh handling by their human masters. \n
They were still bearingf heavily armored men, \n
or dragging ever heavier war machinery. \n
Behind them, far in the rear of the column, \n
were the Cavalry Horses, select, pampered, \n
protected by four ranks of soldiers on all sides. \n
Close by and equally protected by rows of soldiers, \n
the Prince who wanted to become a King, rode \n
his black stallion next to six subtle advisers \n
who determined whether arms and battle should \n
subdue his opponents, or words and treachery. \n
The Prince considered them his last and best teachers. \n
As his army positioned itself across the land \n
base of the port city of Xenahuan, \n
like ponderous chessmen on a flimsy table. \n
The Prince, the chessmaster, sat erect \n
and perfectly poised on his noble black stallion. \n
He clutched the Sphere of Heaven in his left \n
hand, and the Scepter of Power in his right. \n
He raised them slightly and moved them back \n
as if performing a benediction over his army. \n
Capturing this city, joining it to his other \n
conquests would prove his worthiness for crown \n
and kingdom. On the ramparts, from towers, \n
from Cathedral Hill, citizens and defenders alike \n
were waving anything white! A whole city was \n
surrendering spontaneously. Scores of weapons \n
they throw from the parapets to the ground below. \n
Thousands upon thousands cheers shatter the sky \n
as they call the Prince their liberator! \n
It is the Prince's move. He could unleash his soldiers \n
to riot and pillage, to rape and murder, to send \n
a warning to the other coastal cities, and let \n
fear do the work of conquest. Or he could be magnanimous. \n
While an eerie silence falls over the deserted \n
streets of Xenahuan, the Prince huddles in secret speech \n
with his six advisers. They drink wine which the Abbey's \n
monks had preserved for seventy years, eat a feast \n
prepared by trembling cooks, and decide to act with mercy. \n
Three days later, riding his glorious black stallion, \n
the Prince, now officially a King, leads his army \n
out of Xenohuan, turns the double column of troops \n
inland, away from the desert coastline toward \n
the High Plateau of the interior where the undefeated \n
tribe of Lycians live without a central authority. \n
This offends the newly crowned King, and he intends \n
a quick lesson delivered by his direct authority. \n
Oh, King, when you put on that crown, you put on blinders, too! \n
The King carouses nightly with his court, makes \n
marriage plans and battle plans at the same time, \n
as if winning a woman's heart was just a matter of \n
strategy, and crushing the Lycians just as matter of \n
displaying his authority. Already his cavalry skirmished \n
with mounted Lycians and lost six riders and six horses. \n
An engagment with his advanced guard was inconclusive. \n
But the King enjoya his crown, and the increased deference. \n
His generals look nervously into the vast distances everywhere. \n
In the weeks to come skirmishes will increase, men \n
and horses will die. Supplies from Xenohuan will slow, \n
gradually messengers will bring excuses but no supplies. \n
Reinforcements will get lost and fall into Lycian traps. \n
But the King will drench himself with wine, and declare, \n
By next year, I will not just be a King, I will be an Emperor! \n
Meanwhile, steadily, relentlessly, the memory of pastures \n
recedes in the consciousness of horses. Finally, the memory \n
will dissolve, the pastures forgotten, beauty cannot save them. \n<|endoftext|>
narrative \n
As the festive season draws near, \n
There is excitement in the air, \n
Spurring a welcome sense of cheer, \n
Which both adults and children share, \n
There's hopes a snowfall will occur, \n
And you see loved ones as planned for, \n
Surplus from the harvests there were, \n
Means that there is a feast in store, \n
As soon as advent has begun, \n
Days can't pass fast enough for some, \n
Light candles till the wait is done, \n
And the awaited shall soon come, \n
Good will to those that have it tough, \n
As Christmas spirit grows in us, \n
To be with loved ones is enough, \n
There is no need for too much fuss, \n
Make sure preparations are laid, \n
And you have stocked full the cupboard, \n
While mixing pudding to be made, \n
Voice wishes you hope get answered, \n
Claim the best fir tree there's to find, \n
Which shan't go up before it should, \n
Keep the superstition in mind, \n
Wait till Christmas Eve if you could, \n
Dress the house up with evergreen, \n
Those plants in which spirits remain, \n
They promise a spring shall be seen, \n
Cold and darkness won't always reign, \n
The tree we take care to adorn, \n
Shades gifts we're eager to open, \n
As they cannot wait until dawn, \n
Glee is seen in eyes of children, \n
Since there is no evil about, \n
On Christmas Eve people unite, \n
Signalled by church bells ringing out, \n
There is praise given at midnight, \n
Faithful kneel to see out advent, \n
It's said creatures too do this act, \n
Till sunup time's restlessly spent, \n
As promises of joy distract, \n
Soon after children stir they wake, \n
And to the Christmas tree they sneak, \n
While careful of the noise they make, \n
At their presents they hope to peek, \n
That in which Kris Kringle partook, \n
Spurs us to give and receive back, \n
Warmed by a sincere thankful look, \n
Which on Christmas morning few lack, \n
Only brief moments are tranquil, \n
Till kitchens have goods to reveal, \n
With rich foods to give us our fill, \n
All gather for the family meal, \n
The pudding is the most special, \n
Because it's used to fortune tell, \n
Silver hidden in a morsel, \n
Means in the new year you'll do well, \n
Each festive day should be joyous, \n
So keep decorations in place, \n
Up till the twelfth day of Christmas, \n
Else there will be bad luck to face, \n
The season has come to a close, \n
It's one others cannot surpass, \n
Saddened when the festive cheer goes, \n
For till there's more a year must pass. \n<|endoftext|>
narrative \n
a poem in twelve rounds \n
1. \n
My head so big \n
they had to pry \n
me out. I'm sorry \n
Bird (is what I call \n
my mother). Cassius \n
Marcellus Clay, \n
Muhammad Ali; \n
you can say \n
my name in any \n
language, any \n
continent: Ali. \n
2. \n
Two photographs \n
of Emmett Till, \n
born my year, \n
on my birthday. \n
One, he's smiling, \n
happy, and the other one \n
is after. His mother \n
did the bold thing, \n
kept the casket open, \n
made the thousands look upon \n
his bulging eyes, \n
his twisted neck, \n
her lynched black boy. \n
I couldn't sleep \n
for thinking, \n
Emmett Till. \n
One day I went \n
Down to the train tracks, \n
found some iron \n
shoe-shine rests \n
and planted them \n
between the ties \n
and waited \n
for a train to come, \n
and watched the train \n
derail, and ran, \n
and after that \n
I slept at night. \n
3. \n
I need to train \n
around people, \n
hear them talk, \n
talk back. I need \n
to hear the traffic, \n
see people in \n
the barbershop, \n
people getting \n
shoe shines, talking, \n
hear them talk, \n
talk back. \n
4. \n
Bottom line: Olympic gold \n
can't buy a black man \n
a Louisville hamburger \n
in nineteen-sixty. \n
Wasn't even real gold. \n
I watched the river \n
drag the ribbon down, \n
red, white, and blue. \n
5. \n
Laying on the bed, \n
praying for a wife, \n
in walk Sonji Roi. \n
Pretty little shape. \n
Do you like \n
chop suey? \n
Can I wash your hair \n
underneath \n
that wig? \n
Lay on the bed, \n
Girl. Lie \n
with me. \n
Shake to the east, \n
to the north, \n
south, west— \n
but remember, \n
remember, I need \n
a Muslim wife. So \n
Quit using lipstick. \n
Quit your boogaloo. \n
Cover up your knees \n
like a Muslim \n
wife, religion, \n
religion, a Muslim \n
wife. Eleven \n
months with Sonji, \n
first woman I loved. \n
6. \n
There's not \n
too many days \n
that pass that I \n
don't think \n
of how it started, \n
but I know \n
no Great White Hope \n
can beat \n
a true black champ. \n
Jerry Quarry \n
could have been \n
a movie star, \n
a millionaire, \n
a senator, \n
a president— \n
he only had \n
to do one thing, \n
is whip me, \n
but he can't. \n
7. Dressing-Room Visitor \n
He opened \n
up his shirt: \n
"KKK" cut \n
in his chest. \n
He dropped \n
his trousers: \n
latticed scars \n
where testicles \n
should be, His face \n
bewildered, frozen \n
in the Alabama woods \n
that night in 1966 \n
when they left him \n
for dead, his testicles \n
in a Dixie cup. \n
You a warning, \n
they told him, \n
to smart-mouth, \n
sassy-acting niggers, \n
meaning niggers \n
still alive, \n
meaning any nigger, \n
meaning niggers \n
like me. \n
8. Training \n
Unsweetened grapefruit juice \n
will melt my stomach down. \n
Don't drive if you can walk, \n
don't walk if you can run. \n
I add a mile each day \n
and run in eight-pound boots. \n
My knuckles sometimes burst \n
the glove. I let dead skin \n
build up, and then I peel it, \n
let it scar, so I don't bleed \n
as much. My bones \n
absorb the shock. \n
I train in three-minute \n
spurts, like rounds: three \n
rounds big bag, three speed \n
bag, three jump rope, one- \n
minute breaks, \n
no more, no less. \n
Am I too old? Eat only \n
kosher meat. Eat cabbage, \n
carrots, beets, and watch \n
the weight come down: \n
two-thirty, two-twenty, \n
two-ten, two-oh-nine. \n
9. \n
Will I go \n
like Kid Paret, \n
a fractured \n
skull, a ten-day \n
sleep, dreaming \n
alligators, pork \n
chops, saxophones, \n
slow grinds, funk, \n
fishbowls, lightbulbs, \n
bats, typewriters, \n
tuning forks, funk \n
clocks, red rubber \n
ball, what you see \n
in that lifetime \n
knockout minute \n
on the cusp? \n
You could be \n
let go, \n
you could be \n
snatched back. \n
10. Rumble in the Jungle \n
Ali boma ye, \n
Ali boma ye, \n
means kill him, Ali, \n
which is different \n
from a whupping \n
which is what I give, \n
but I lead them chanting \n
anyway, Ali \n
boma ye, because \n
here in Africa \n
black people fly \n
planes and run countries. \n
I'm still making up \n
for the foolishness \n
I said when I was \n
Clay from Louisville, \n
where I learned Africans \n
live naked in straw \n
huts eating tiger meat, \n
grunting and grinning, \n
swinging from vines, \n
pounding their chests— \n
I pound my chest but of my own accord. \n
11. \n
I said to Joe Frazier, \n
first thing, get a good house \n
in case you get crippled \n
so you and your family \n
can sleep somewhere. Always \n
keep one good Cadillac. \n
And watch how you dress \n
with that cowboy hat, \n
pink suits, white shoes— \n
that's how pimps dress, \n
or kids, and you a champ, \n
or wish you were, ‘cause \n
I can whip you in the ring \n
or whip you in the street. \n
Now back to clothes, \n
wear dark clothes, suits, \n
black suits, like you the best \n
at what you do, like you \n
President of the World. \n
Dress like that. \n
Put them yellow pants away. \n
We dinosaurs gotta \n
look good, gotta sound \n
good, gotta be good, \n
the greatest, that's what \n
I told Joe Frazier, \n
and he said to me, \n
we both bad niggers. \n
We don't do no crawlin'. \n
12. \n
They called me "the fistic pariah." \n
They said I didn't love my country, \n
called me a race-hater, called me out \n
of my name, waited for me \n
to come out on a stretcher, shot at me, \n
hexed me, cursed me, wished me \n
all manner of ill will, \n
told me I was finished. \n
Here I am, \n
like the song says, \n
come and take me, \n
"The People's Champ," \n
myself, \n
Muhammad. \n<|endoftext|>
narrative \n
The water is blackish, green, and dark. \n
It gathers from its separated state, gathers from rain, gathers into stream. \n
It gathers in the mountain. \n
It gathers then travels, collects to become brackish. \n
Water travels, falls over a cliff, is falling. \n
Water is falling. \n
Falling onto rocks. \n
Because water falls it is. \n
Because water streams it is. \n
Because water collects into a pool it is narrative. \n
The pool is cold. \n
The pool is sheltered from sun by a cliff. \n
The pool is filled with rocks. \n
Water gathers over rocks, on rocks. \n
Moss gathers over rocks, on rocks. \n
Three arrive at this scene. \n
This scene where water is cold. \n
Where rocks are mossy. \n
When the three enter the pool their feet slip on rocks that are mossy. \n
As they slip, they slip deeper into water. \n
Slip on mossy coldness. \n
Slip into water so cold it makes their chest close. \n
Slip deeply in. \n
Water gathers them, gathers them by their slipping. \n
Water covers them. \n
Because water is brackish it is narrative. \n
Because water is brackish they don't open their mouths. \n
Because water is brackish they are closed in their immersion. \n
They do immerse. \n
But they don't open as they swim to falling water. \n
They stand beneath falling water. \n
Water beats down on them. \n
Beats on their shoulders. \n
Beats on their heads. Beats on them. \n
They stand beneath water that is a roar of a falling. \n
They stand in roar, in narrative. \n
But water is brackish. \n
So they do not kiss. \n
Do not open their mouth beneath the waterfall. \n
They let brackish water fall over them. \n
Over their heads. \n
Over their lips. \n
Over their eyes. \n
Over their ears. \n
Over their hands which they hold up to feel the roar landing into their palms. \n
Down their body. \n
Brackish water. \n
Closed bodies. \n
Water gathers them to this place, this narrative place. \n
Water covers them and they are covered with brackish water. \n
They do immerse. \n
They don't open. \n
Immersion seals them off. \n
There is no open mouth. \n
No opening. \n
No exchanging. \n
Because it is brackish it is narrative falling over them. \n
It falls over. \n
It falls over them. \n
Sealed yet together. \n
They have come together with brackish. \n
They have let brackish wash over then even if they don't let it inside. \n
Because water falls it is narrative. \n
Because they are immersed it is narrative. \n
Because they love each other while separated it is narrative. \n
Because the rocks are slippery with green moss it is narrative. \n
Because they slip on the rocks it is narrative. \n
Because they slip deeper into water. \n
Because they allow the slip, are prepared for the slip and love its immersion it is narrative. Because it involves love it is narrative. \n

narrative \n
He was an only son born out of wedlock \n
Of a Spanish baron and an Asian lass. \n
His white fair skin showed European looks \n
But his person was crude and without class. \n
War years of forty-one were his childhood, \n
The Japs occupied his land, our country. \n
His father taken for a G.I. was shot for good, \n
So his mother lost her riches, eventually. \n
His mother was a shrewd covetous woman, \n
Sly as a fox and venomous as a snake. \n
Had no qualms using people to get what she can- \n
Selfish and greedy, wanted all she could take. \n
She sent him to work as a well-paid seaman, \n
Off to a cargo ship of the rich Danish lines. \n
For dollars he earned as the ship's boiler man \n
His mom was so happy, everything seemed fine. \n
When the ship docked awhile at the Carribean \n
The crew checked the bars for a drink of beer. \n
The bartender was black, almost a jet-black man- \n
Soon he was the butt of jokes, an insult, a jeer. \n
Antonio, the Spanish-Asian illegitimate guy, \n
Enjoyed teasing the bartender out of spite. \n
He had drunk too much and later said good bye, \n
In bed he kept seeing the black man's face that night. \n
He had nightmares, lost sleep, and woke up tired. \n
His fellow seamen said he walked around at night. \n
No longer could he do the work for which he was hired \n
The captain sent him home fast on the next flight. \n
His mother saw her son and knew he acted odd. \n
His mind was like dust the wind has blown away, \n
He spoke of the black bartender, the encounter he had- \n
Is it voodoo, is it witchcraft? ......what can you say? \n
Antonio was my cousin and this is a true story, \n
We don't know if it was karma for his mother's deeds. \n
Perhaps what was sown was reaped, like cruelty. \n
If we sow goodness in life surely, to blessing it leads. \n

bio \n
Once a time upon itself, \n
The wave of conception had blown \n
And outweighed a fair self, \n
Who to pregnance was loaned. \n
Then she did bore a berry, \n
That's achetyped to the southern cherry. \n
(It's shape like the mortal, \n
And his wits like the immortal.) \n
What was brought forth by the self, \n
Was no other person but my veryself. \n
And then i'd grown and still growing. \n
The berry is now in poetry glowing. \n
And one day the berry would be ripe for the teeth, \n
And either death or rapture shall eat it. \n

Autrement dit, dans les sociétés normales, on ne fait pas obstacle à la parole mais on classe différemment les gens. Les savants pondérés et éminents sont écoutés avec grand respect. Les satiristes sont écoutés avec un moindre respect et avec perplexité. Les racistes et les antisémites sont écoutés à travers un filtre d'opprobre et sans respect. Les gens qui veulent être écoutés attentivement doivent le mériter par leur conduite. \n
C'est organique, belle et rose, romantique; pourtant, les sociétés ne font pas de guerre, les entreprises n'hésiter à le faire. \n<|endoftext|>

One of the oldest families \n
Best known for their good Irish name; \n
Lived in this house on this land, \n
Grandsons planned to do the same. \n
Three worn, corner-chipped, porch steps \n
Stacked up to an aging screen door \n
That squeaked when I opened it, \n
Closed slowly as I crossed the floor. \n
A pull chain lit the darkness \n
In the small bedroom I called mine; \n
Where I dreamed of tomorrow, \n
Thought out how I'd cross finish lines. \n
The back yard was my sports field, \n
Had shade trees and low limbs to dodge; \n
Cement strips weeds grew between \n
Led from the street to this garage. \n
This house won't last forever \n
And strangers might live on this land; \n
But folks won't forget me \n
'Cause they shook my grandfather's hand. \n<|endoftext|>

Charlene's Song \n
Tethered to Life by Virtue \n
To go back to the beginning seems similar to piecing together \n
the phylogeny of our speciation \n
Then even more enlightened knowing that we met juxtaposed another predestined quest, desegregation \n
But the collage begins to appear as it did before from the vat of life's \n
Large gratuitous phylactery \n
And still as euphoric and soothing, and like the craft of Faberge', still \n
somewhat of a romantic mystery \n
I was glad to hear that the other day, you were pushed by a heart empathetic \n
And compassionate as well as zealous \n
And I realized I still had part of it, which ranged from botanical \n
To political to religious \n
When I think back to the days of swings at Alice Keith, sitting by the waters at \n
Sabine Pass, it can seem facetious \n
But watching the stars in their serious but frolicsome nature, I realize it wasn't really at all that capricious \n
Even now when I close my eyes, I can hear the ballads you sang from 'Silent Night' to the many whys of martyrdom \n
And realize that those whys are answered \n
With a most efficacious persistence \n
Which is why I call you an Otradom \n
I hear the guttural hymns of the winds after having benevolently fostered the sun back into the morning skies \n
Birds sing out the order of ascent, \n
Canines beckon their neighbors, \n
Kids sit abreast; one laughs, one cries \n
At the beginning of the season, you fashioned my heart, the greatest gift of the virtuous knight \n
And by the end of the summer, those wounds had formed a crest, and created a greater sight \n
The day I heard that the throes of life was a simple appendix, I rejoiced with hallelujah \n
And after touring with Motley Crew, \n
Luther Vandrose and the Guys only widened my panorama \n
There are really 'no good guys or bad guys' \n
as the song so eloquently says \n
I only wished I had written this years ago, and wished you happier days \n
Like the prayer Otradom PeloGo, the love you shared helped me through the days my mind was in a martial disposition \n
And I now realize that its only more venerated with judicial interposition \n
It wasn't until the time we spent in San Diego, that I realized \n
that my heart was not only wanton but obstinate \n
And that when the other half was joined to it, it became complete as well as immaculate \n
As we sailed the waters to Sapporo, and danced with the children from igloo to ice castle \n
The fact that I'm glad that half of my hearts is still in Misawa is regaling as well as veritable \n
Its sometimes takes more than words to express the love between me and you \n
Therefore it's the last wish on the list, one that means the constituents are \n
not only coupled with love, but also tethered with virtue \n
Even after the semester ends, traveling around the world seems to only extend the trek, not allay \n
Then is embraced with affection while playing scrabble with Joe and Alta Mae \n
Then walking through an extravaganza of memories books toys and clothes, so fastidiously keen \n
While sorting out the favorite pictures of \n
Charles, Jay and Arlene \n
While sitting with Joshua, Solomon, and Desiree, I realized life can be so enigmatic as well as eleemosynary \n
So I only advise applying prudence as well as virtue when deciding \n
which hand delivered the one called Billy \n
The advise I've gotten from friends and family has only made me wise as I brood and roam \n
And although there is only one place we can call ours, there are a million we can call home \n
There are times I wonder how things will turn out, how we're going to make it \n
Then there are times that I can easily \n
overcome when just thinking about \n
walking through the Big Thicket \n
Even now I feel that because we can overcome the past makes life as simple as walking on black ice \n
And although it my never be perfect, \n
It's the effort, which I've seen, which makes it a worthy price \n
As we ran like children from the Aqua \n
Festival, Lake Travis, and even to the top of the Austin dam \n
Only to become more exhilarated as we raced through the streets of Korea as guests of Uncle Sam \n
I still set things on fire, and promise to keep such an expensive point of view \n
And after the fourteen years of going through it all, I still promise to keep such an expensive I love you \n
After flying the ferrous wings of wisdom from here to the heart of the Oakland and San Francisco Bay \n
I've learned to love all things, respect all things, and call all things except you and me \n
Go Pe (God's People) \n
Most of the time I would like to be pragmatic, rational, but I desire \n
for you that part of my heart remain contumacious \n
And desire for us, that it remains open, loyal, virtuous, and yet ostentatious \n<|endoftext|>
bio \n
My mom is sixty-four; will be sixty-five April the twenty-seventh. I just got off of the phone with her, ironically; a few people to be more precise; my mom and sister; trying to increase the tolerance level, making the bonds stronger, and as one would say, keeping the lines of communications open. This morning I went by to have a cup of coffee; since I moved here, I don't go by very much, so whenever I have the chance, I call and invite myself over for a hot cup of coffee or just a short and cordial conversation. \n
Usually I call home with nothing in particular to say; how is everything going, who's all there, what's for dinner, or did I get any mail; five minutes or so and say good-bye. One day it was okra, sometimes pork chops, fried chicken, sometimes gumbo; and she usually offers; but an hour walk over to her house or just as long transferring on buses, makes the acceptance rare. \n
My relationship with my mother has taken a progressive and even pragmatic course; I'm sure I was the most loved child when younger, of the five of us, but I'm sure we all thought that. Though as I have become older, I can see the relationship that she has with the rest of the family, I think it's all shared equally. Yet over the last several years, I think that I probably found myself saying the least, though seeing the bond between Barbara and her grow more than ever before. Barbara is the oldest, and their relationship has taken the opposite course; saying more over the years as we have grown older, or rather more mature; thus their relationship has grown tremendously. And even being more surprised as how close the bond between Gary, my younger brother, the youngest child in the family, has also grown, and the bonds between Clinton Jr., my oldest brother and Brenda, my youngest sister; I guess noticing the way that we have changed over the years, though something that I wouldn‘t have noticed when I was younger, but have truly appreciated being able to see it form and mature over the last several years. So that makes two brothers and two sisters, a mom and a dad; I think two and half is supposed to be the size of a normal family, but apparently my mom and dad tried to improve on that; my friend that I grew up with, his mom had sixteen kids. \n
My dad and Mom are about the same age; though I think that my dad may be a year younger; they are both from Louisiana; my mom from Saint Martinsville, and my dad from Shatan or I think he said the name changed later to Ville Platt. \n
When I called she said that he had gone to work for the day; to one of the day labors; I think last week she said that he may start driving a truck again; ‘Here comes that leviathan', Here comes the battle of the tireless with eighteen wheels; he has been driving for as long as I can remember, and even had the chance as a kid to go out with him a couple of times when he worked for Steadman, a paper recycling company where we would pick up bails of paper and take them to the warehouse. But all of the above reasons make calling home of course almost a natural response. \n
But as I said, the phone call seems to take on a pattern of a cordial family phone call that I have been familiar with all of my life, and one that causes even a subconscious awareness of those we love without putting it together until something extraordinary, either good or bad, causes it to make a profound plea for manifestation. \n
Ironically enough, it's my mom's birthday, so we'll go over to wish her what you would call a happy birthday, though about my mom's and dad's age, they usually admonish you for having brought too many candles. I called her yesterday just to say hello, and talked for a while, and told her that I would go by on her birthday. \n
I saw Clinton Jr. and his wife Sibil last Sunday; Easter Sunday, and told them the same. They came to pick me up and gave me a ride over to my mom's house for Easter supper in one of the smaller leviathans with four wheels and five doors called a blue van, which between the plate that I had over there and the one she gave me to take with me, has kept me filled even until today. When I called yesterday she said that she and my dad were sitting outside; that was about six o'clock; sometimes they grab a couple of chairs, a cup of coffee and sit outside just as it begins to cool off a little before the setting of the sun. She told me that her granddaughter, my niece, was glad for the Barbie doll that I bought her, and I will have to pick up something for her older brother also. \n
Barbara, since she works the afternoons was probably there with her son or rather, my mom told me that they had gone to the store, every now and then, they jump into the car just to go out for a little drive before coming in for the evening. Brenda may have been still at work; she usually stops by on her way home. I asked her how was school going, she said that she was taking six hours and would probably take nine or twelve next semester. I told her that I just called to say hello after getting in from work. \n
I asked my Mom did she want me to pick her up something; she said a chicken, and some cooking oil; my mom cooks rather well; there is just about nothing that I wouldn't eat that she cooks, except cabbage, mustard greens or okra; where I lost the taste for it, I have no idea; but I look forward to seeing the grandkids learning how to cook or bake something themselves. I don't know how they see handing down the art of cooking; either as a secret or cultural heritage; I've tried to get her to teach me a couple of times but never really caught on; though my mom's brother; Chris, is a great cook; something that he probably got from his mom; my grandmother. So our first venture will be a trip over to grandma's house. \n

cascade \n
In the Cascade Gardens at Broadbeach a South Queensland coastal Town \n
The fruit bats in their thousands roost hanging upside down \n
There must be twenty thousand and that is just a guess \n
And if you pressed me further i'd say there's more than less. \n
The fruit bats or flying foxes the name most know them by \n
Leave their roost in the evening when darkness cloak the sky \n
In search of fruit and wild figs they fly for miles around \n
And return before daybreak to their trees on roosting ground \n
The fruit bats on their roosting trees quite often disagree \n
And if one is evicted he fly to other tree \n
To rest near friendlier neighbour who will allow him space \n
In fruit bat pecking order each find their rightful place. \n
The fruit bats of Cascade Gardens dark wings and heads of brown \n
On trees along by the river roost hanging upside down \n
In search of fruit and wild figs they fly for miles around \n
And return before daybreak to their trees on roosting ground \n<|endoftext|>
cascade \n
Sitting on a rock, near a cascade \n
Reflections from the sun, on the waters parade \n
Cold, jet stream, falling from grace \n
Filling the lake, in this tranquil place \n
It rests my soul, to hear the sound \n
Of this flowing essence, caressing the ground \n
It runs endlessly, to enchant and entice \n
This cascade in the midst, and middle of paradise. \n

Back when I was living in Florida, in West Palm Beach, \n
It was a difficult life for me to live in, \n
The jobs were a lot Buls#$%@T and my marriage to Jan was out of reach, \n
We struggled to make the mortgage payments, \n
-when Jan said, \n
“We have to go an interest only mortgage.” \n
Needless to say we did not, \n
-and we had to sell the house, \n
And Jan filed for divorce, \n
Jan said we can go our ways, \n
-our marriage is dead. \n
But in interim time I was job hunting, \n
And I was interviewed by Liberty Mortgage Company. \n
I, at the time was a smooth talker; \n
the work was on commission base only, \n
That when I was first associated with sub-prime loans, \n
Although I was not mortgage broker, \n
- my job was to get the salesperson in the house, \n
The salesperson would sell the contract for the mortgage, \n
The mortgage broker would finish the deal. \n
But it somehow did not seem real. \n
They told me that could pull 6 figures in a year’s time, \n
They told that the housing market wouldn’t cool off, \n
-everything would be sublime, \n
They were counting on people like Jan, \n
Who would borrow up to 120% THEIR HOMES VALUE! \n
To payoff high credit card debt that was the plan, \n
The interest only loan was 2/28 Mortgage, \n
The first two years was less money going out, \n
But the 25 month was shocker to most people, \n
Their homes lost value when housing market went awry, \n
The payments became so steep they cried to their mortgage holders, \n
The mortgage holders cried to the banks, \n
he banks cried to the Government. \n
HELP US! \n
But what has happened cannot be reversed that easily, \n
The Liberty Mortgage Company, \n
in Boca Raton, \n
is one a thousand companies, \n
That led people in to the abyss with their bubble, \n
Their bubble broke, \n
-and the people fought to get to the surface. \n
The Liberty Mortgage Company is still in business, \n
like a thousand other companies, \n
This reflection of this greed conspiracy, \n
Is still in the mirror of the stock exchange worldwide, \n
Like Dominoes, the markets crash into the abyss, \n
By the way, --I didn’t take the job. \n
It has been 8 months to the day, \n
That I wrote on this observation, \n
I wrote about the bearish market by the way, \n
In the observation about the Bear Stearns situation. \n
Many of the Wall Street companies are no more, \n
Their stock holders wiped out, \n
The Government is bailing out Freddy, Fannie, AIG, \n
If you’re going to rip off the system, \n
do it big, \n
For you are going to be so big that country will be devastated if you fail, \n
(By the way Lehman Brothers was bought by Barclay’s, \n
Merrill-Lynch will be bought out by Bank of America, \n
and Washington Mutual is for sale, \n
-I guess they weren’t as big as I thought) \n
This is going to the cost better than a trillion dollars or more, \n
This is the kind of legacy we leave for future generations? \n
We have our deficits in their lives, \n
Where our sins stored. \n
Not to mention the wars, \n
natural disasters such like Hurricanes Katrina and Ike, \n
Our future generations will be holding the mortgage on the mortgage brokers. \n
And if they fail who will bail out them? \n
The Savings and Loan disaster, \n
ENRON, what a bunch of thieving jokers, \n
The latest con was the mortgage brokers \n
- and Wall Street and the like. \n
The Wall Street Bail Out is under going pressure, \n
It’s not exactly what the Treasury Department had in mind, \n
The Feds took over WaMu and sold to JPMorgan Chase for pennies on the dollar, \n
The stock holders were greedy they were blind, \n
Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, \n
like buying a $30,000 car for 300 or less, \n
But unfortunately the car wasn’t given road test. \n
Wachovia is being bought by CitiGroup Bank, \n
Before it’s over a few others will join the ranks, \n
The $700,000,000,000.00 bail out has to pass both houses yet a second they do not miss, \n
Because the fading \n
Domino chips are cascading; Into the abyss. \n
It was reported on the AP at 3: 10 EST that the Congress failed to pass the bill, \n
Stocks were plunging before this happened, \n
It took a lot of guts if you will, \n
The is closest we have come to The Great Depression. \n
The Dow took a plunge this afternoon, \n
The Asian markets will open up soon, \n
And the European Markets will open as time goes around the globe, \n
And tomorrow will be here before we know it, \n
The economy flashing a strobe, \n
Full of anxiety not bliss, \n
Worldly Domino Chips are cascading, \n
Into the Abyss. \n
The blaming starts, as my wife, Judy, \n
said we are to blame, \n
For Carpe Diem, the greed, \n
the wants, \n
the covetous nature, \n
Not saving money, \n
being entirely in debt and our savings are lame, \n
We should have been more mature. \n
The Bail Out has succeeded, \n
They were warning signs that went unheeded \n
The Government owns Wall Street, \n
So much for capitalism, \n
I would not dreamed that the observation SPQR would come to this, \n
Karl Marx is rolling in his grave, with laughter, \n
The father of Socialism and Communism. \n
Now the bill is signed but effective will it be, \n
It should fortify credit that is the theory, \n
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts is seeking the same deal as Wall Street, \n
The Kennedy Empire is no match against the Feds, \n
Common wealth equates to people’s assets, \n
American taxpayers money. \n
The job I didn’t take at Liberty Mutual is somehow directly responsible for this, \n
If it wasn’t so sad it would be kind of funny, \n
It’s kind of a mean trick, \n
The world waits as the hand unfolds, \n
it won’t be long. \n
Many ordinary people from Algiers to New Delhi have watched \n
Wall Street degenerates on TV as if it were a gruesome spectator sport, \n
its casualties limited to American homeowners and investment bankers. \n
But it is also taking a toll on lives less clearly linked to what's gone wrong. \n
The New World Order, \n
when gets a cold, \n
Everybody gets sick. \n
The bail out was ruled law, \n
it came and went, \n
But in the worldly stock markets- \n
In Asia, the Nikkei 225 closed 4.25 percent lower. \n
Europe's stock markets \n
also declined, with the FTSE-100 down 3.32 percent, \n
Germany's DAX down 5.72 percent, \n
and France's CAC-40 down 6.31 percent. \n
Banks across the globe are reacting with anxiety, \n
The economy is based on emotion rather than gold, \n
The economic prognosis is a study in psychiatry, \n
I hope the stocks are bought more than they are sold. \n
Who knows what tomorrow brings, \n
Maybe benelovence or malevolence lurking, \n
'The fact is people are scared and the only thing they're doing is selling, ' \n
said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer's Investment \n
Research. \n
'Investors are cleaning out portfolios and getting rid of everything \n
because nothing seems to be working.' \n
When will it end? \n
The Abyss, by definition, has no end, \n
A world moratorium is needed for trading stocks, \n
To stabilize the markets-with some luck. \n
The “bears” are running amuck, \n
A bank holiday is needed for the entire world economy, \n
This is fairy tale with non-intrinsic money, \n
That is based on emotion rather than based on Gold (ilocks) . \n
The stock market is being battered again, \n
This time to dropp is for GM, \n
General Motors Acceptance Corporation is in the dust, \n
Like so many cars made by GM they turned to rust. \n
GM has trouble selling cars, \n
Let alone bad mortgages, \n
They are about to get knocked out and see stars, \n
As their crumbling market falls apart. \n
The Dow took a plunge falling below 9,000. \n
To bad the economy has no such icon as “Restart.” \n
The Dow had has its worst since it began, \n
President Bush will be on TV later this morning, \n
To say our economy is strong for every American Woman or Man, \n
More manure from the White House, \n
We, the mushrooms, are kept in the dark. \n
What else does he have to offer? \n
He is a lame duck and has an approval rating, when graded, would be F, \n
Minus times 10. \n
20 top financial leaders met at White House to solve the world economic crisis, \n
More or less to get in the black, bring home the bacon, \n
Get the Home when run around the bases, \n
Officials from the Group of 20 countries — which include the wealthiest and the world's biggest developing nations such as China, Brazil and India — planned to attend a meeting Saturday evening that Paulson requested to explain the actions that U.S. and other wealthy nations have taken. \n
The Bush Administration is not entirely to blame, \n
A Couple people to name, \n
Senator Dodd and Representative Barney Frank, both Democrats, \n
Did head the legislative governing bodies as far as financial matters, \n
Dodd and Frank were sleeping in bed with mortgage bankers, \n
For shame they put blame, on the Republicans only, \n
And for shame Obama does not this foul in the political game. \n
Today that stock market rebounded, \n
Are we over the crash yet? \n
Before the closing bell sounded, \n
The confidence is almost there, \n
Paul Krugman, PhD. at Princeton in economics, won the Nobel Prize, \n
To him with much surprise, \n
He won it based formula of “free-trade” globalization. \n
He won within a week or the most turbulent times across the globe, \n
Most economies were stagnant if not dead. \n
“He has thereby integrated the previously disparate research fields of international trade and economic geography, ' it (the Nobel Academy) said. \n
I did not to take his class to understand, \n
The movie “Wall Street” is the only class you have to take, \n
The house of cards is based upon greed, \n
The house of cards is based upon personal covetous aspirations, \n
The house of cards is based upon emotion rather than gold. \n
The house of cards is based upon fear. \n
The house of cards is based upon for people to part of an indentured slavery, \n
On earth, some of which the dark side bought when their souls were sold. \n
I may not have a Nobel Economics Prize, \n
I may not have pulled six figures, \n
Nor to that once was and will not be again-the one’s that would not be on “bucket list”, \n
And for “Dominoes” let’s play the game of 42, and our fears done in to the abyss. \n

There is a sadness now in the old place \n
Much too much of a wide empty space \n
Since the family have all moved away \n
Even the black cat`s been left to stray \n
But I still hear footsteps upon the path \n
Yet I never did see anyone visit at all \n
They have never had any visitors call \n
I shall go and take a look after my bath \n
Or maybe I shall telephone a policeman \n
If I knew where a telephone was I can \n
I would look silly if it were just a ghost \n
Maybe I will just put some milk in a pan \n
And do what I always like making most \n
A cup of cocoa for my next doors host. \n

POLLIO \n
Muses of Sicily, essay we now \n
A somewhat loftier task! Not all men love \n
Coppice or lowly tamarisk: sing we woods, \n
Woods worthy of a Consul let them be. \n
Now the last age by Cumae's Sibyl sung \n
Has come and gone, and the majestic roll \n
Of circling centuries begins anew: \n
Justice returns, returns old Saturn's reign, \n
With a new breed of men sent down from heaven. \n
Only do thou, at the boy's birth in whom \n
The iron shall cease, the golden race arise, \n
Befriend him, chaste Lucina; 'tis thine own \n
Apollo reigns. And in thy consulate, \n
This glorious age, O Pollio, shall begin, \n
And the months enter on their mighty march. \n
Under thy guidance, whatso tracks remain \n
Of our old wickedness, once done away, \n
Shall free the earth from never-ceasing fear. \n
He shall receive the life of gods, and see \n
Heroes with gods commingling, and himself \n
Be seen of them, and with his father's worth \n
Reign o'er a world at peace. For thee, O boy, \n
First shall the earth, untilled, pour freely forth \n
Her childish gifts, the gadding ivy-spray \n
With foxglove and Egyptian bean-flower mixed, \n
And laughing-eyed acanthus. Of themselves, \n
Untended, will the she-goats then bring home \n
Their udders swollen with milk, while flocks afield \n
Shall of the monstrous lion have no fear. \n
Thy very cradle shall pour forth for thee \n
Caressing flowers. The serpent too shall die, \n
Die shall the treacherous poison-plant, and far \n
And wide Assyrian spices spring. But soon \n
As thou hast skill to read of heroes' fame, \n
And of thy father's deeds, and inly learn \n
What virtue is, the plain by slow degrees \n
With waving corn-crops shall to golden grow, \n
From the wild briar shall hang the blushing grape, \n
And stubborn oaks sweat honey-dew. Nathless \n
Yet shall there lurk within of ancient wrong \n
Some traces, bidding tempt the deep with ships, \n
Gird towns with walls, with furrows cleave the earth. \n
Therewith a second Tiphys shall there be, \n
Her hero-freight a second Argo bear; \n
New wars too shall arise, and once again \n
Some great Achilles to some Troy be sent. \n
Then, when the mellowing years have made thee man, \n
No more shall mariner sail, nor pine-tree bark \n
Ply traffic on the sea, but every land \n
Shall all things bear alike: the glebe no more \n
Shall feel the harrow's grip, nor vine the hook; \n
The sturdy ploughman shall loose yoke from steer, \n
Nor wool with varying colours learn to lie; \n
But in the meadows shall the ram himself, \n
Now with soft flush of purple, now with tint \n
Of yellow saffron, teach his fleece to shine. \n
While clothed in natural scarlet graze the lambs. \n
'Such still, such ages weave ye, as ye run,' \n
Sang to their spindles the consenting Fates \n
By Destiny's unalterable decree. \n
Assume thy greatness, for the time draws nigh, \n
Dear child of gods, great progeny of Jove! \n
See how it totters- the world's orbed might, \n
Earth, and wide ocean, and the vault profound, \n
All, see, enraptured of the coming time! \n
Ah! might such length of days to me be given, \n
And breath suffice me to rehearse thy deeds, \n
Nor Thracian Orpheus should out-sing me then, \n
Nor Linus, though his mother this, and that \n
His sire should aid- Orpheus Calliope, \n
And Linus fair Apollo. Nay, though Pan, \n
With Arcady for judge, my claim contest, \n
With Arcady for judge great Pan himself \n
Should own him foiled, and from the field retire. \n
Begin to greet thy mother with a smile, \n
O baby-boy! ten months of weariness \n
For thee she bore: O baby-boy, begin! \n
For him, on whom his parents have not smiled, \n
Gods deem not worthy of their board or bed. \n<|endoftext|>
eclogue \n
SCENE, the Desert TIME, Mid-day \n
10 In silent horror o'er the desert-waste \n
The driver Hassan with his camels passed. \n
One cruse of water on his back he bore, \n
And his light scrip contained a scanty store; \n
A fan of painted feathers in his hand, \n
To guard his shaded face from scorching sand. \n
The sultry sun had gained the middle sky, \n
And not a tree and not an herb was nigh. \n
The beasts with pain their dusty way pursue, \n
Shrill roared the winds and dreary was the view! \n
20 With desperate sorrow wild, the affrighted man \n
Thrice sighed, thrice struck his breast, and thus began: \n
`Sad was the hour and luckless was the day, \n
When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way. \n
`Ah! little thought I of the blasting wind, \n
The thirst or pinching hunger that I find! \n
Bethink thee, Hassan, where shall thirst assuage, \n
When fails this cruse, his unrelenting rage? \n
Soon shall this scrip its precious load resign, \n
Then what but tears and hunger shall be thine? \n
30 `Ye mute companions of my toils, that bear \n
In all my griefs a more than equal share! \n
Here, where no springs in murmurs break away, \n
Or moss-crowned fountains mitigate the day, \n
In vain ye hope the green delights to know, \n
Which plains more blest or verdant vales bestow. \n
Here rocks alone and tasteless sands are found, \n
And faint and sickly winds for ever howl around. \n
Sad was the hour and luckless was the day, \n
When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way. \n
40 `Cursed be the gold and silver which persuade \n
Weak men to follow far-fatiguing trade. \n
The Lily-Peace outshines the silver store, \n
And life is dearer than the golden ore. \n
Yet money tempts us o'er the desert brown, \n
To every distant mart and wealthy town: \n
Full oft we tempt the land and oft the sea; \n
And are we only yet repaid by thee? \n
Ah! why was ruin so attractive made, \n
Or why fond man so easily betrayed? \n
50 Why heed we not, whilst mad we haste along, \n
The gentle voice of Peace or Pleasure's song? \n
Or wherefore think the flowery mountain's side, \n
The fountain's murmurs and the valley's pride, \n
Why think we these less pleasing to behold \n
Than dreary deserts, if they lead to gold? \n
Sad was the hour and luckless was the day, \n
When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way. \n
`O cease, my fears! all frantic as I go, \n
When thought creates unnumbered scenes of woe, \n
60 What if the lion in his rage I meet! \n
Oft in the dust I view his printed feet: \n
And fearful! oft, when Day's declining light \n
Yields her pale empire to the mourner Night, \n
By hunger roused, he scours the groaning plain, \n
Gaunt wolves and sullen tigers in his train: \n
Before them death with shrieks directs their way, \n
Fills the wild yell and leads them to their prey. \n
Sad was the hour and luckless was the day, \n
When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way! \n
70 `At that dead hour the silent asp shall creep, \n
If aught of rest I find, upon my sleep; \n
Or some swoll'n serpent twist his scales around, \n
And wake to anguish with a burning wound. \n
Thrice happy they, the wise contented poor, \n
From lust of wealth and dread of death secure. \n
They tempt no deserts and no griefs they find; \n
Peace rules the day, where reason rules the mind. \n
Sad was the hour and luckless was the day, \n
When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way. \n
80 `O hapless youth! for she thy love hath won, \n
The tender Zara, will be most undone! \n
Big swelled my heart and owned the powerful maid, \n
When fast she dropped her tears, as thus she said: \n
``Farewell the youth whom sighs could not detain, \n
``Whom Zara's breaking heart implored in vain; \n
``Yet as thou goest, may every blast arise, \n
``Weak and unfelt as these rejected sighs! \n
``Safe o'er the wild, no perils mayst thou see, \n
``No griefs endure, nor weep, false youth, like me.'' \n
O let me safely to the fair return, \n
Say with a kiss, she must not, shall not mourn. \n
Go teach my heart to lose its painful fears, \n
Recalled by Wisdom's voice and Zara's tears.' \n
He said, and called on heaven to bless the day, \n
When back to Schiraz' walls he bent his way. \n<|endoftext|>
eclogue \n
SCENE, a Valley near Bagdat TIME, the Morning \n
`Ye Persian maids, attend your poet's lays, \n
And hear how shepherds pass their golden days: \n
Not all are blest, whom fortune's hand sustains \n
With wealth in courts, nor all that haunt the plains: \n
Well may your hearts believe the truths I tell; \n
'Tis virtue makes the bliss, where'er we dwell.' \n
Thus Selim sung, by sacred Truth inspired; \n
No praise the youth, but hers alone, desired. \n
Wise in himself, his meaning songs conveyed \n
Informing morals to the shepherd maid, \n
Or taught the swains that surest bliss to find, \n
What groves nor streams bestow, a virtuous mind. \n
When sweet and odorous, like an eastern bride, \n
The radiant morn resumed her orient pride, \n
When wanton gales along the valleys play, \n
Breathe on each flower, and bear their sweets away: \n
By Tigris' wandering waves he sat, and sung \n
This useful lesson for the fair and young. \n
`Ye Persian dames,' he said, `to you belong, \n
Well may they please, the morals of my song; \n
No fairer maids, I trust, than you are found, \n
Graced with soft arts, the peopled world around! \n
The morn that lights you to your loves supplies \n
Each gentler ray delicious to your eyes: \n
For you those flowers her fragrant hands bestow, \n
And yours the love that kings delight to know. \n
Yet think not these, all beauteous as they are, \n
The best kind blessings heaven can grant the fair! \n
Who trust alone in beauty's feeble ray, \n
Balsora's pearls have more of worth than they; \n
Drawn from the deep, they sparkle to the sight, \n
And all-unconscious shoot a lustrous light: \n
Such are the maids and such the charms they boast, \n
By sense unaided or to virtue lost. \n
Self-flattering sex! your hearts believe in vain \n
That love shall blind when once he fires the swain, \n
Or hope a lover by your faults to win, \n
As spots on ermine beautify the skin. \n
Who seeks secure to rule, be first her care \n
Each softer virtue that adorns the fair, \n
Each tender passion man delights to find, \n
The loved perfections of a female mind. \n
`Blest were the days when Wisdom held her reign, \n
And shepherds sought her on the silent plain; \n
With Truth she wedded in the secret grove, \n
The fair-eyed Truth, and daughters blessed their love. \n
`O haste, fair maids, ye Virtues, come away, \n
Sweet Peace and Plenty lead you on your way! \n
The balmy shrub for you shall love our shore, \n
By Ind excelled or Araby no more. \n
`Lost to our fields, for so the fates ordain, \n
The dear deserters shall return again. \n
O come thou, Modesty, as they decree, \n
The rose may then improve her blush by thee. \n
Here make thy court amidst our rural scene, \n
And shepherd-girls shall own thee for their queen. \n
With thee be Chastity, of all afraid, \n
Distrusting all, a wise suspicious maid, \n
But man the most -- not more the mountain doe \n
Holds the swift falcon for her deadly foe. \n
Cold is her breast, like flowers that drink the dew; \n
A silken veil conceals her from the view. \n
No wild desires amidst thy train be known, \n
But Faith, whose heart is fixed on one alone; \n
Desponding Meekness with her down-cast eyes, \n
And friendly Pity full of tender sighs; \n
And Love the last: by these your hearts approve, \n
These are the Virtues that must lead to love.' \n
Thus sung the swain, and eastern legends say \n
The maids of Bagdat verified the lay: \n
Dear to the plains, the Virtues came along, \n
The shepherds loved, and Selim blessed his song. \n<|endoftext|>

ROSALIND, HELEN, and her Child. \n
SCENE. The Shore of the Lake of Como. \n
HELEN \n
Come hither, my sweet Rosalind. \n
'T is long since thou and I have met; \n
And yet methinks it were unkind \n
Those moments to forget. \n
Come, sit by me. I see thee stand \n
By this lone lake, in this far land, \n
Thy loose hair in the light wind flying, \n
Thy sweet voice to each tone of even \n
United, and thine eyes replying \n
To the hues of yon fair heaven. \n
Come, gentle friend! wilt sit by me? \n
And be as thou wert wont to be \n
Ere we were disunited? \n
None doth behold us now; the power \n
That led us forth at this lone hour \n
Will be but ill requited \n
If thou depart in scorn. Oh, come, \n
And talk of our abandoned home! \n
Remember, this is Italy, \n
And we are exiles. Talk with me \n
Of that our land, whose wilds and floods, \n
Barren and dark although they be, \n
Were dearer than these chestnut woods; \n
Those heathy paths, that inland stream, \n
And the blue mountains, shapes which seem \n
Like wrecks of childhood's sunny dream; \n
Which that we have abandoned now, \n
Weighs on the heart like that remorse \n
Which altered friendship leaves. I seek \n
No more our youthful intercourse. \n
That cannot be! Rosalind, speak, \n
Speak to me! Leave me not! When morn did come, \n
When evening fell upon our common home, \n
When for one hour we parted,--do not frown; \n
I would not chide thee, though thy faith is broken; \n
But turn to me. Oh! by this cherished token \n
Of woven hair, which thou wilt not disown, \n
Turn, as 't were but the memory of me, \n
And not my scornèd self who prayed to thee! \n
ROSALIND \n
Is it a dream, or do I see \n
And hear frail Helen? I would flee \n
Thy tainting touch; but former years \n
Arise, and bring forbidden tears; \n
And my o'erburdened memory \n
Seeks yet its lost repose in thee. \n
I share thy crime. I cannot choose \n
But weep for thee; mine own strange grief \n
But seldom stoops to such relief; \n
Nor ever did I love thee less, \n
Though mourning o'er thy wickedness \n
Even with a sister's woe. I knew \n
What to the evil world is due, \n
And therefore sternly did refuse \n
To link me with the infamy \n
Of one so lost as Helen. Now, \n
Bewildered by my dire despair, \n
Wondering I blush, and weep that thou \n
Shouldst love me still--thou only!--There, \n
Let us sit on that gray stone \n
Till our mournful talk be done. \n
HELEN \n
Alas! not there; I cannot bear \n
The murmur of this lake to hear. \n
A sound from there, Rosalind dear, \n
Which never yet I heard elsewhere \n
But in our native land, recurs, \n
Even here where now we meet. It stirs \n
Too much of suffocating sorrow! \n
In the dell of yon dark chestnut wood \n
Is a stone seat, a solitude \n
Less like our own. The ghost of peace \n
Will not desert this spot. To-morrow, \n
If thy kind feelings should not cease, \n
We may sit here. \n
ROSALIND \n
Thou lead, my sweet, \n
And I will follow. \n
HENRY \n
'T is Fenici's seat \n
Where you are going? This is not the way, \n
Mamma; it leads behind those trees that grow \n
Close to the little river. \n
HELEN \n
Yes, I know; \n
I was bewildered. Kiss me and be gay, \n
Dear boy; why do you sob? \n
HENRY \n
I do not know; \n
But it might break any one's heart to see \n
You and the lady cry so bitterly. \n
HELEN \n
It is a gentle child, my friend. Go home, \n
Henry, and play with Lilla till I come. \n
We only cried with joy to see each other; \n
We are quite merry now. Good night. \n
The boy \n
Lifted a sudden look upon his mother, \n
And, in the gleam of forced and hollow joy \n
Which lightened o'er her face, laughed with the glee \n
Of light and unsuspecting infancy, \n
And whispered in her ear, 'Bring home with you \n
That sweet strange lady-friend.' Then off he flew, \n
But stopped, and beckoned with a meaning smile, \n
Where the road turned. Pale Rosalind the while, \n
Hiding her face, stood weeping silently. \n
In silence then they took the way \n
Beneath the forest's solitude. \n
It was a vast and antique wood, \n
Through which they took their way; \n
And the gray shades of evening \n
O'er that green wilderness did fling \n
Still deeper solitude. \n
Pursuing still the path that wound \n
The vast and knotted trees around, \n
Through which slow shades were wandering, \n
To a deep lawny dell they came, \n
To a stone seat beside a spring, \n
O'er which the columned wood did frame \n
A roofless temple, like the fane \n
Where, ere new creeds could faith obtain, \n
Man's early race once knelt beneath \n
The overhanging deity. \n
O'er this fair fountain hung the sky, \n
Now spangled with rare stars. The snake, \n
The pale snake, that with eager breath \n
Creeps here his noontide thirst to slake, \n
Is beaming with many a mingled hue, \n
Shed from yon dome's eternal blue, \n
When he floats on that dark and lucid flood \n
In the light of his own loveliness; \n
And the birds, that in the fountain dip \n
Their plumes, with fearless fellowship \n
Above and round him wheel and hover. \n
The fitful wind is heard to stir \n
One solitary leaf on high; \n
The chirping of the grasshopper \n
Fills every pause. There is emotion \n
In all that dwells at noontide here; \n
Then through the intricate wild wood \n
A maze of life and light and motion \n
Is woven. But there is stillness now-- \n
Gloom, and the trance of Nature now. \n
The snake is in his cave asleep; \n
The birds are on the branches dreaming; \n
Only the shadows creep; \n
Only the glow-worm is gleaming; \n
Only the owls and the nightingales \n
Wake in this dell when daylight fails, \n
And gray shades gather in the woods; \n
And the owls have all fled far away \n
In a merrier glen to hoot and play, \n
For the moon is veiled and sleeping now. \n
The accustomed nightingale still broods \n
On her accustomed bough, \n
But she is mute; for her false mate \n
Has fled and left her desolate. \n
This silent spot tradition old \n
Had peopled with the spectral dead. \n
For the roots of the speaker's hair felt cold \n
And stiff, as with tremulous lips he told \n
That a hellish shape at midnight led \n
The ghost of a youth with hoary hair, \n
And sate on the seat beside him there, \n
Till a naked child came wandering by, \n
When the fiend would change to a lady fair! \n
A fearful tale! the truth was worse; \n
For here a sister and a brother \n
Had solemnized a monstrous curse, \n
Meeting in this fair solitude; \n
For beneath yon very sky, \n
Had they resigned to one another \n
Body and soul. The multitude, \n
Tracking them to the secret wood, \n
Tore limb from limb their innocent child, \n
And stabbed and trampled on its mother; \n
But the youth, for God's most holy grace, \n
A priest saved to burn in the market-place. \n
Duly at evening Helen came \n
To this lone silent spot, \n
From the wrecks of a tale of wilder sorrow \n
So much of sympathy to borrow \n
As soothed her own dark lot. \n
Duly each evening from her home, \n
With her fair child would Helen come \n
To sit upon that antique seat, \n
While the hues of day were pale; \n
And the bright boy beside her feet \n
Now lay, lifting at intervals \n
His broad blue eyes on her; \n
Now, where some sudden impulse calls, \n
Following. He was a gentle boy \n
And in all gentle sorts took joy. \n
Oft in a dry leaf for a boat, \n
With a small feather for a sail, \n
His fancy on that spring would float, \n
If some invisible breeze might stir \n
Its marble calm; and Helen smiled \n
Through tears of awe on the gay child, \n
To think that a boy as fair as he, \n
In years which never more may be, \n
By that same fount, in that same wood, \n
The like sweet fancies had pursued; \n
And that a mother, lost like her, \n
Had mournfully sate watching him. \n
Then all the scene was wont to swim \n
Through the mist of a burning tear. \n
For many months had Helen known \n
This scene; and now she thither turned \n
Her footsteps, not alone. \n
The friend whose falsehood she had mourned \n
Sate with her on that seat of stone. \n
Silent they sate; for evening, \n
And the power its glimpses bring, \n
Had with one awful shadow quelled \n
The passion of their grief. They sate \n
With linkèd hands, for unrepelled \n
Had Helen taken Rosalind's. \n
Like the autumn wind, when it unbinds \n
The tangled locks of the nightshade's hair \n
Which is twined in the sultry summer air \n
Round the walls of an outworn sepulchre, \n
Did the voice of Helen, sad and sweet, \n
And the sound of her heart that ever beat \n
As with sighs and words she breathed on her, \n
Unbind the knots of her friend's despair, \n
Till her thoughts were free to float and flow; \n
And from her laboring bosom now, \n
Like the bursting of a prisoned flame, \n
The voice of a long-pent sorrow came. \n
ROSALIND \n
I saw the dark earth fall upon \n
The coffin; and I saw the stone \n
Laid over him whom this cold breast \n
Had pillowed to his nightly rest! \n
Thou knowest not, thou canst not know \n
My agony. Oh! I could not weep. \n
The sources whence such blessings flow \n
Were not to be approached by me! \n
But I could smile, and I could sleep, \n
Though with a self-accusing heart. \n
In morning's light, in evening's gloom, \n
I watched--and would not thence depart-- \n
My husband's unlamented tomb. \n
My children knew their sire was gone; \n
But when I told them, 'He is dead,' \n
They laughed aloud in frantic glee, \n
They clapped their hands and leaped about, \n
Answering each other's ecstasy \n
With many a prank and merry shout. \n
But I sate silent and alone, \n
Wrapped in the mock of mourning weed. \n
They laughed, for he was dead; but I \n
Sate with a hard and tearless eye, \n
And with a heart which would deny \n
The secret joy it could not quell, \n
Low muttering o'er his loathèd name; \n
Till from that self-contention came \n
Remorse where sin was none; a hell \n
Which in pure spirits should not dwell. \n
I 'll tell thee truth. He was a man \n
Hard, selfish, loving only gold, \n
Yet full of guile; his pale eyes ran \n
With tears which each some falsehood told, \n
And oft his smooth and bridled tongue \n
Would give the lie to his flushing cheek; \n
He was a coward to the strong; \n
He was a tyrant to the weak, \n
On whom his vengeance he would wreak; \n
For scorn, whose arrows search the heart, \n
From many a stranger's eye would dart, \n
And on his memory cling, and follow \n
His soul to its home so cold and hollow. \n
He was a tyrant to the weak, \n
And we were such, alas the day! \n
Oft, when my little ones at play \n
Were in youth's natural lightness gay, \n
Or if they listened to some tale \n
Of travellers, or of fairyland, \n
When the light from the wood-fire's dying brand \n
Flashed on their faces,--if they heard \n
Or thought they heard upon the stair \n
His footstep, the suspended word \n
Died on my lips; we all grew pale; \n
The babe at my bosom was hushed with fear \n
If it thought it heard its father near; \n
And my two wild boys would near my knee \n
Cling, cowed and cowering fearfully. \n
I 'll tell thee truth: I loved another. \n
His name in my ear was ever ringing, \n
His form to my brain was ever clinging; \n
Yet, if some stranger breathed that name, \n
My lips turned white, and my heart beat fast. \n
My nights were once haunted by dreams of flame, \n
My days were dim in the shadow cast \n
By the memory of the same! \n
Day and night, day and night, \n
He was my breath and life and light, \n
For three short years, which soon were passed. \n
On the fourth, my gentle mother \n
Led me to the shrine, to be \n
His sworn bride eternally. \n
And now we stood on the altar stair, \n
When my father came from a distant land, \n
And with a loud and fearful cry \n
Rushed between us suddenly. \n
I saw the stream of his thin gray hair, \n
I saw his lean and lifted hand, \n
And heard his words--and live! O God! \n
Wherefore do I live?--'Hold, hold!' \n
He cried, 'I tell thee 't is her brother! \n
Thy mother, boy, beneath the sod \n
Of yon churchyard rests in her shroud so cold; \n
I am now weak, and pale, and old; \n
We were once dear to one another, \n
I and that corpse! Thou art our child!' \n
Then with a laugh both long and wild \n
The youth upon the pavement fell. \n
They found him dead! All looked on me, \n
The spasms of my despair to see; \n
But I was calm. I went away; \n
I was clammy-cold like clay. \n
I did not weep; I did not speak; \n
But day by day, week after week, \n
I walked about like a corpse alive. \n
Alas! sweet friend, you must believe \n
This heart is stone--it did not break. \n
My father lived a little while, \n
But all might see that he was dying, \n
He smiled with such a woful smile. \n
When he was in the churchyard lying \n
Among the worms, we grew quite poor, \n
So that no one would give us bread; \n
My mother looked at me, and said \n
Faint words of cheer, which only meant \n
That she could die and be content; \n
So I went forth from the same church door \n
To another husband's bed. \n
And this was he who died at last, \n
When weeks and months and years had passed, \n
Through which I firmly did fulfil \n
My duties, a devoted wife, \n
With the stern step of vanquished will \n
Walking beneath the night of life, \n
Whose hours extinguished, like slow rain \n
Falling forever, pain by pain, \n
The very hope of death's dear rest; \n
Which, since the heart within my breast \n
Of natural life was dispossessed, \n
Its strange sustainer there had been. \n
When flowers were dead, and grass was green \n
Upon my mother's grave--that mother \n
Whom to outlive, and cheer, and make \n
My wan eyes glitter for her sake, \n
Was my vowed task, the single care \n
Which once gave life to my despair-- \n
When she was a thing that did not stir, \n
And the crawling worms were cradling her \n
To a sleep more deep and so more sweet \n
Than a baby's rocked on its nurse's knee, \n
I lived; a living pulse then beat \n
Beneath my heart that awakened me. \n
What was this pulse so warm and free? \n
Alas! I knew it could not be \n
My own dull blood. 'T was like a thought \n
Of liquid love, that spread and wrought \n
Under my bosom and in my brain, \n
And crept with the blood through every vein, \n
And hour by hour, day after day, \n
The wonder could not charm away \n
But laid in sleep my wakeful pain, \n
Until I knew it was a child, \n
And then I wept. For long, long years \n
These frozen eyes had shed no tears; \n
But now--'t was the season fair and mild \n
When April has wept itself to May; \n
I sate through the sweet sunny day \n
By my window bowered round with leaves, \n
And down my cheeks the quick tears ran \n
Like twinkling rain-drops from the eaves, \n
When warm spring showers are passing o'er. \n
O Helen, none can ever tell \n
The joy it was to weep once more! \n
I wept to think how hard it were \n
To kill my babe, and take from it \n
The sense of light, and the warm air, \n
And my own fond and tender care, \n
And love and smiles; ere I knew yet \n
That these for it might, as for me, \n
Be the masks of a grinning mockery. \n
And haply, I would dream, 't were sweet \n
To feed it from my faded breast, \n
Or mark my own heart's restless beat \n
And watch the growing soul beneath \n
Dawn in faint smiles; and hear its breath, \n
Half interrupted by calm sighs, \n
And search the depth of its fair eyes \n
For long departed memories! \n
And so I lived till that sweet load \n
Was lightened. Darkly forward flowed \n
The stream of years, and on it bore \n
Two shapes of gladness to my sight; \n
Two other babes, delightful more, \n
In my lost soul's abandoned night, \n
Than their own country ships may be \n
Sailing towards wrecked mariners \n
Who cling to the rock of a wintry sea. \n
For each, as it came, brought soothing tears; \n
And a loosening warmth, as each one lay \n
Sucking the sullen milk away, \n
About my frozen heart did play, \n
And weaned it, oh, how painfully-- \n
As they themselves were weaned each one \n
From that sweet food--even from the thirst \n
Of death, and nothingness, and rest, \n
Strange inmate of a living breast, \n
Which all that I had undergone \n
Of grief and shame, since she who first \n
The gates of that dark refuge closed \n
Came to my sight, and almost burst \n
The seal of that Lethean spring-- \n
But these fair shadows interposed. \n
For all delights are shadows now! \n
And from my brain to my dull brow \n
The heavy tears gather and flow. \n
I cannot speak--oh, let me weep! \n
The tears which fell from her wan eyes \n
Glimmered among the moonlight dew. \n
Her deep hard sobs and heavy sighs \n
Their echoes in the darkness threw. \n
When she grew calm, she thus did keep \n
The tenor of her tale:-- \n
He died; \n
I know not how; he was not old, \n
If age be numbered by its years; \n
But he was bowed and bent with fears, \n
Pale with the quenchless thirst of gold, \n
Which, like fierce fever, left him weak; \n
And his strait lip and bloated cheek \n
Were warped in spasms by hollow sneers; \n
And selfish cares with barren plough, \n
Not age, had lined his narrow brow, \n
And foul and cruel thoughts, which feed \n
Upon the withering life within, \n
Like vipers on some poisonous weed. \n
Whether his ill were death or sin \n
None knew, until he died indeed, \n
And then men owned they were the same. \n
Seven days within my chamber lay \n
That corse, and my babes made holiday. \n
At last, I told them what is death. \n
The eldest, with a kind of shame, \n
Came to my knees with silent breath, \n
And sate awe-stricken at my feet; \n
And soon the others left their play, \n
And sate there too. It is unmeet \n
To shed on the brief flower of youth \n
The withering knowledge of the grave. \n
From me remorse then wrung that truth. \n
I could not bear the joy which gave \n
Too just a response to mine own. \n
In vain. I dared not feign a groan; \n
And in their artless looks I saw, \n
Between the mists of fear and awe, \n
That my own thought was theirs; and they \n
Expressed it not in words, but said, \n
Each in its heart, how every day \n
Will pass in happy work and play, \n
Now he is dead and gone away! \n
After the funeral all our kin \n
Assembled, and the will was read. \n
My friend, I tell thee, even the dead \n
Have strength, their putrid shrouds within, \n
To blast and torture. Those who live \n
Still fear the living, but a corse \n
Is merciless, and Power doth give \n
To such pale tyrants half the spoil \n
He rends from those who groan and toil, \n
Because they blush not with remorse \n
Among their crawling worms. Behold, \n
I have no child! my tale grows old \n
With grief, and staggers; let it reach \n
The limits of my feeble speech, \n
And languidly at length recline \n
On the brink of its own grave and mine. \n
Thou knowest what a thing is Poverty \n
Among the fallen on evil days. \n
'T is Crime, and Fear, and Infamy, \n
And houseless Want in frozen ways \n
Wandering ungarmented, and Pain, \n
And, worse than all, that inward stain, \n
Foul Self-contempt, which drowns in sneers \n
Youth's starlight smile, and makes its tears \n
First like hot gall, then dry forever! \n
And well thou knowest a mother never \n
Could doom her children to this ill, \n
And well he knew the same. The will \n
Imported that, if e'er again \n
I sought my children to behold, \n
Or in my birthplace did remain \n
Beyond three days, whose hours were told, \n
They should inherit nought; and he, \n
To whom next came their patrimony, \n
A sallow lawyer, cruel and cold, \n
Aye watched me, as the will was read, \n
With eyes askance, which sought to see \n
The secrets of my agony; \n
And with close lips and anxious brow \n
Stood canvassing still to and fro \n
The chance of my resolve, and all \n
The dead man's caution just did call; \n
For in that killing lie 't was said-- \n
'She is adulterous, and doth hold \n
In secret that the Christian creed \n
Is false, and therefore is much need \n
That I should have a care to save \n
My children from eternal fire.' \n
Friend, he was sheltered by the grave, \n
And therefore dared to be a liar! \n
In truth, the Indian on the pyre \n
Of her dead husband, half consumed, \n
As well might there be false as I \n
To those abhorred embraces doomed, \n
Far worse than fire's brief agony. \n
As to the Christian creed, if true \n
Or false, I never questioned it; \n
I took it as the vulgar do; \n
Nor my vexed soul had leisure yet \n
To doubt the things men say, or deem \n
That they are other than they seem. \n
All present who those crimes did hear, \n
In feigned or actual scorn and fear, \n
Men, women, children, slunk away, \n
Whispering with self-contented pride \n
Which half suspects its own base lie. \n
I spoke to none, nor did abide, \n
But silently I went my way, \n
Nor noticed I where joyously \n
Sate my two younger babes at play \n
In the courtyard through which I passed; \n
But went with footsteps firm and fast \n
Till I came to the brink of the ocean green, \n
And there, a woman with gray hairs, \n
Who had my mother's servant been, \n
Kneeling, with many tears and prayers, \n
Made me accept a purse of gold, \n
Half of the earnings she had kept \n
To refuge her when weak and old. \n
With woe, which never sleeps or slept, \n
I wander now. 'T is a vain thought-- \n
But on yon Alp, whose snowy head \n
'Mid the azure air is islanded, \n
(We see it--o'er the flood of cloud, \n
Which sunrise from its eastern caves \n
Drives, wrinkling into golden waves, \n
Hung with its precipices proud-- \n
From that gray stone where first we met) \n
There--now who knows the dead feel nought?-- \n
Should be my grave; for he who yet \n
Is my soul's soul once said: ''T were sweet \n
'Mid stars and lightnings to abide, \n
And winds, and lulling snows that beat \n
With their soft flakes the mountain wide, \n
Where weary meteor lamps repose, \n
And languid storms their pinions close, \n
And all things strong and bright and pure, \n
And ever during, aye endure. \n
Who knows, if one were buried there, \n
But these things might our spirits make, \n
Amid the all-surrounding air, \n
Their own eternity partake?' \n
Then 't was a wild and playful saying \n
At which I laughed or seemed to laugh. \n
They were his words--now heed my praying, \n
And let them be my epitaph. \n
Thy memory for a term may be \n
My monument. Wilt remember me? \n
I know thou wilt; and canst forgive, \n
Whilst in this erring world to live \n
My soul disdained not, that I thought \n
Its lying forms were worthy aught, \n
And much less thee. \n
HELEN \n
Oh, speak not so! \n
But come to me and pour thy woe \n
Into this heart, full though it be, \n
Aye overflowing with its own. \n
I thought that grief had severed me \n
From all beside who weep and groan, \n
Its likeness upon earth to be-- \n
Its express image; but thou art \n
More wretched. Sweet, we will not part \n
Henceforth, if death be not division; \n
If so, the dead feel no contrition. \n
But wilt thou hear, since last we parted, \n
All that has left me broken-hearted? \n
ROSALIND \n
Yes, speak. The faintest stars are scarcely shorn \n
Of their thin beams by that delusive morn \n
Which sinks again in darkness, like the light \n
Of early love, soon lost in total night. \n
HELEN \n
Alas! Italian winds are mild, \n
But my bosom is cold--wintry cold; \n
When the warm air weaves, among the fresh leaves, \n
Soft music, my poor brain is wild, \n
And I am weak like a nursling child, \n
Though my soul with grief is gray and old. \n
ROSALIND \n
Weep not at thine own words, though they must make \n
Me weep. What is thy tale? \n
HELEN \n
I fear 't will shake \n
Thy gentle heart with tears. Thou well \n
Rememberest when we met no more; \n
And, though I dwelt with Lionel, \n
That friendless caution pierced me sore \n
With grief; a wound my spirit bore \n
Indignantly--but when he died, \n
With him lay dead both hope and pride. \n
Alas! all hope is buried now. \n
But then men dreamed the aged earth \n
Was laboring in that mighty birth \n
Which many a poet and a sage \n
Has aye foreseen--the happy age \n
When truth and love shall dwell below \n
Among the works and ways of men; \n
Which on this world not power but will \n
Even now is wanting to fulfil. \n
Among mankind what thence befell \n
Of strife, how vain, is known too well; \n
When Liberty's dear pæan fell \n
'Mid murderous howls. To Lionel, \n
Though of great wealth and lineage high, \n
Yet through those dungeon walls there came \n
Thy thrilling light, O Liberty! \n
And as the meteor's midnight flame \n
Startles the dreamer, sun-like truth \n
Flashed on his visionary youth, \n
And filled him, not with love, but faith, \n
And hope, and courage mute in death; \n
For love and life in him were twins, \n
Born at one birth. In every other \n
First life, then love, its course begins, \n
Though they be children of one mother; \n
And so through this dark world they fleet \n
Divided, till in death they meet; \n
But he loved all things ever. Then \n
He passed amid the strife of men, \n
And stood at the throne of armèd power \n
Pleading for a world of woe. \n
Secure as one on a rock-built tower \n
O'er the wrecks which the surge trails to and fro, \n
'Mid the passions wild of humankind \n
He stood, like a spirit calming them; \n
For, it was said, his words could bind \n
Like music the lulled crowd, and stem \n
That torrent of unquiet dream \n
Which mortals truth and reason deem, \n
But is revenge and fear and pride. \n
Joyous he was; and hope and peace \n
On all who heard him did abide, \n
Raining like dew from his sweet talk, \n
As where the evening star may walk \n
Along the brink of the gloomy seas, \n
Liquid mists of splendor quiver. \n
His very gestures touched to tears \n
The unpersuaded tyrant, never \n
So moved before; his presence stung \n
The torturers with their victim's pain, \n
And none knew how; and through their ears \n
The subtle witchcraft of his tongue \n
Unlocked the hearts of those who keep \n
Gold, the world's bond of slavery. \n
Men wondered, and some sneered to see \n
One sow what he could never reap; \n
For he is rich, they said, and young, \n
And might drink from the depths of luxury. \n
If he seeks fame, fame never crowned \n
The champion of a trampled creed; \n
If he seeks power, power is enthroned \n
'Mid ancient rights and wrongs, to feed \n
Which hungry wolves with praise and spoil \n
Those who would sit near power must toil; \n
And such, there sitting, all may see. \n
What seeks he? All that others seek \n
He casts away, like a vile weed \n
Which the sea casts unreturningly. \n
That poor and hungry men should break \n
The laws which wreak them toil and scorn \n
We understand; but Lionel, \n
We know, is rich and nobly born. \n
So wondered they; yet all men loved \n
Young Lionel, though few approved; \n
All but the priests, whose hatred fell \n
Like the unseen blight of a smiling day, \n
The withering honey-dew which clings \n
Under the bright green buds of May \n
Whilst they unfold their emerald wings; \n
For he made verses wild and queer \n
On the strange creeds priests hold so dear \n
Because they bring them land and gold. \n
Of devils and saints and all such gear \n
He made tales which whoso heard or read \n
Would laugh till he were almost dead. \n
So this grew a proverb: 'Don't get old \n
Till Lionel's Banquet in Hell you hear, \n
And then you will laugh yourself young again.' \n
So the priests hated him, and he \n
Repaid their hate with cheerful glee. \n
Ah, smiles and joyance quickly died, \n
For public hope grew pale and dim \n
In an altered time and tide, \n
And in its wasting withered him, \n
As a summer flower that blows too soon \n
Droops in the smile of the waning moon, \n
When it scatters through an April night \n
The frozen dews of wrinkling blight. \n
None now hoped more. Gray Power was seated \n
Safely on her ancestral throne; \n
And Faith, the Python, undefeated \n
Even to its blood-stained steps dragged on \n
Her foul and wounded train; and men \n
Were trampled and deceived again, \n
And words and shows again could bind \n
The wailing tribes of humankind \n
In scorn and famine. Fire and blood \n
Raged round the raging multitude, \n
To fields remote by tyrants sent \n
To be the scornèd instrument \n
With which they drag from mines of gore \n
The chains their slaves yet ever wore; \n
And in the streets men met each other, \n
And by old altars and in halls, \n
And smiled again at festivals. \n
But each man found in his heart's brother \n
Cold cheer; for all, though half deceived, \n
The outworn creeds again believed, \n
And the same round anew began \n
Which the weary world yet ever ran. \n
Many then wept, not tears, but gall, \n
Within their hearts, like drops which fall \n
Wasting the fountain-stone away. \n
And in that dark and evil day \n
Did all desires and thoughts that claim \n
Men's care--ambition, friendship, fame, \n
Love, hope, though hope was now despair-- \n
Indue the colors of this change, \n
As from the all-surrounding air \n
The earth takes hues obscure and strange, \n
When storm and earthquake linger there. \n
And so, my friend, it then befell \n
To many,--most to Lionel, \n
Whose hope was like the life of youth \n
Within him, and when dead became \n
A spirit of unresting flame, \n
Which goaded him in his distress \n
Over the world's vast wilderness. \n
Three years he left his native land, \n
And on the fourth, when he returned, \n
None knew him; he was stricken deep \n
With some disease of mind, and turned \n
Into aught unlike Lionel. \n
On him--on whom, did he pause in sleep, \n
Serenest smiles were wont to keep, \n
And, did he wake, a wingèd band \n
Of bright Persuasions, which had fed \n
On his sweet lips and liquid eyes, \n
Kept their swift pinions half outspread \n
To do on men his least command-- \n
On him, whom once 't was paradise \n
Even to behold, now misery lay. \n
In his own heart 't was merciless-- \n
To all things else none may express \n
Its innocence and tenderness. \n
'T was said that he had refuge sought \n
In love from his unquiet thought \n
In distant lands, and been deceived \n
By some strange show; for there were found, \n
Blotted with tears--as those relieved \n
By their own words are wont to do-- \n
These mournful verses on the ground, \n
By all who read them blotted too. \n
'How am I changed! my hopes were once like fire; \n
I loved, and I believed that life was love. \n
How am I lost! on wings of swift desire \n
Among Heaven's winds my spirit once did move. \n
I slept, and silver dreams did aye inspire \n
My liquid sleep; I woke, and did approve \n
All Nature to my heart, and thought to make \n
A paradise of earth for one sweet sake. \n
'I love, but I believe in love no more. \n
I feel desire, but hope not. Oh, from sleep \n
Most vainly must my weary brain implore \n
Its long lost flattery now! I wake to weep, \n
And sit through the long day gnawing the core \n
Of my bitter heart, and, like a miser, keep-- \n
Since none in what I feel take pain or pleasure-- \n
To my own soul its self-consuming treasure.' \n
He dwelt beside me near the sea; \n
And oft in evening did we meet, \n
When the waves, beneath the starlight, flee \n
O'er the yellow sands with silver feet, \n
And talked. Our talk was sad and sweet, \n
Till slowly from his mien there passed \n
The desolation which it spoke; \n
And smiles--as when the lightning's blast \n
Has parched some heaven-delighting oak, \n
The next spring shows leaves pale and rare, \n
But like flowers delicate and fair, \n
On its rent boughs--again arrayed \n
His countenance in tender light; \n
His words grew subtle fire, which made \n
The air his hearers breathed delight; \n
His motions, like the winds, were free, \n
Which bend the bright grass gracefully, \n
Then fade away in circlets faint; \n
And wingèd Hope--on which upborne \n
His soul seemed hovering in his eyes, \n
Like some bright spirit newly born \n
Floating amid the sunny skies-- \n
Sprang forth from his rent heart anew. \n
Yet o'er his talk, and looks, and mien, \n
Tempering their loveliness too keen, \n
Past woe its shadow backward threw; \n
Till, like an exhalation spread \n
From flowers half drunk with evening dew, \n
They did become infectious--sweet \n
And subtle mists of sense and thought, \n
Which wrapped us soon, when we might meet, \n
Almost from our own looks and aught \n
The wild world holds. And so his mind \n
Was healed, while mine grew sick with fear; \n
For ever now his health declined, \n
Like some frail bark which cannot bear \n
The impulse of an altered wind, \n
Though prosperous; and my heart grew full, \n
'Mid its new joy, of a new care; \n
For his cheek became, not pale, but fair, \n
As rose-o'ershadowed lilies are; \n
And soon his deep and sunny hair, \n
In this alone less beautiful, \n
Like grass in tombs grew wild and rare. \n
The blood in his translucent veins \n
Beat, not like animal life, but love \n
Seemed now its sullen springs to move, \n
When life had failed, and all its pains; \n
And sudden sleep would seize him oft \n
Like death, so calm,--but that a tear, \n
His pointed eye-lashes between, \n
Would gather in the light serene \n
Of smiles whose lustre bright and soft \n
Beneath lay undulating there. \n
His breath was like inconstant flame \n
As eagerly it went and came; \n
And I hung o'er him in his sleep, \n
Till, like an image in the lake \n
Which rains disturb, my tears would break \n
The shadow of that slumber deep. \n
Then he would bid me not to weep, \n
And say, with flattery false yet sweet, \n
That death and he could never meet, \n
If I would never part with him. \n
And so we loved, and did unite \n
All that in us was yet divided; \n
For when he said, that many a rite, \n
By men to bind but once provided, \n
Could not be shared by him and me, \n
Or they would kill him in their glee, \n
I shuddered, and then laughing said-- \n
'We will have rites our faith to bind, \n
But our church shall be the starry night, \n
Our altar the grassy earth outspread, \n
And our priest the muttering wind.' \n
'T was sunset as I spoke. One star \n
Had scarce burst forth, when from afar \n
The ministers of misrule sent \n
Seized upon Lionel, and bore \n
His chained limbs to a dreary tower, \n
In the midst of a city vast and wide. \n
For he, they said, from his mind had bent \n
Against their gods keen blasphemy, \n
For which, though his soul must roasted be \n
In hell's red lakes immortally, \n
Yet even on earth must he abide \n
The vengeance of their slaves: a trial, \n
I think, men call it. What avail \n
Are prayers and tears, which chase denial \n
From the fierce savage nursed in hate? \n
What the knit soul that pleading and pale \n
Makes wan the quivering cheek which late \n
It painted with its own delight? \n
We were divided. As I could, \n
I stilled the tingling of my blood, \n
And followed him in their despite, \n
As a widow follows, pale and wild, \n
The murderers and corse of her only child; \n
And when we came to the prison door, \n
And I prayed to share his dungeon floor \n
With prayers which rarely have been spurned, \n
And when men drove me forth, and I \n
Stared with blank frenzy on the sky,-- \n
A farewell look of love he turned, \n
Half calming me; then gazed awhile, \n
As if through that black and massy pile, \n
And through the crowd around him there, \n
And through the dense and murky air, \n
And the thronged streets, he did espy \n
What poets know and prophesy; \n
And said, with voice that made them shiver \n
And clung like music in my brain, \n
And which the mute walls spoke again \n
Prolonging it with deepened strain-- \n
'Fear not the tyrants shall rule forever, \n
Or the priests of the bloody faith; \n
They stand on the brink of that mighty river, \n
Whose waves they have tainted with death; \n
It is fed from the depths of a thousand dells, \n
Around them it foams, and rages, and swells, \n
And their swords and their sceptres I floating see, \n
Like wrecks, in the surge of eternity.' \n
I dwelt beside the prison gate; \n
And the strange crowd that out and in \n
Passed, some, no doubt, with mine own fate, \n
Might have fretted me with its ceaseless din, \n
But the fever of care was louder within. \n
Soon but too late, in penitence \n
Or fear, his foes released him thence. \n
I saw his thin and languid form, \n
As leaning on the jailor's arm, \n
Whose hardened eyes grew moist the while \n
To meet his mute and faded smile \n
And hear his words of kind farewell, \n
He tottered forth from his damp cell. \n
Many had never wept before, \n
From whom fast tears then gushed and fell; \n
Many will relent no more, \n
Who sobbed like infants then; ay, all \n
Who thronged the prison's stony hall, \n
The rulers or the slaves of law, \n
Felt with a new surprise and awe \n
That they were human, till strong shame \n
Made them again become the same. \n
The prison bloodhounds, huge and grim, \n
From human looks the infection caught, \n
And fondly crouched and fawned on him; \n
And men have heard the prisoners say, \n
Who in their rotting dungeons lay, \n
That from that hour, throughout one day, \n
The fierce despair and hate which kept \n
Their trampled bosoms almost slept, \n
Where, like twin vultures, they hung feeding \n
On each heart's wound, wide torn and bleeding,-- \n
Because their jailors' rule, they thought, \n
Grew merciful, like a parent's sway. \n
I know not how, but we were free; \n
And Lionel sate alone with me, \n
As the carriage drove through the streets apace; \n
And we looked upon each other's face; \n
And the blood in our fingers intertwined \n
Ran like the thoughts of a single mind, \n
As the swift emotions went and came \n
Through the veins of each united frame. \n
So through the long, long streets we passed \n
Of the million-peopled City vast; \n
Which is that desert, where each one \n
Seeks his mate yet is alone, \n
Beloved and sought and mourned of none; \n
Until the clear blue sky was seen, \n
And the grassy meadows bright and green. \n
And then I sunk in his embrace \n
Enclosing there a mighty space \n
Of love; and so we travelled on \n
By woods, and fields of yellow flowers, \n
And towns, and villages, and towers, \n
Day after day of happy hours. \n
It was the azure time of June, \n
When the skies are deep in the stainless noon, \n
And the warm and fitful breezes shake \n
The fresh green leaves of the hedge-row briar; \n
And there were odors then to make \n
The very breath we did respire \n
A liquid element, whereon \n
Our spirits, like delighted things \n
That walk the air on subtle wings, \n
Floated and mingled far away \n
'Mid the warm winds of the sunny day. \n
And when the evening star came forth \n
Above the curve of the new bent moon, \n
And light and sound ebbed from the earth, \n
Like the tide of the full and the weary sea \n
To the depths of its own tranquillity, \n
Our natures to its own repose \n
Did the earth's breathless sleep attune; \n
Like flowers, which on each other close \n
Their languid leaves when daylight's gone, \n
We lay, till new emotions came, \n
Which seemed to make each mortal frame \n
One soul of interwoven flame, \n
A life in life, a second birth \n
In worlds diviner far than earth;-- \n
Which, like two strains of harmony \n
That mingle in the silent sky, \n
Then slowly disunite, passed by \n
And left the tenderness of tears, \n
A soft oblivion of all fears, \n
A sweet sleep:--so we travelled on \n
Till we came to the home of Lionel, \n
Among the mountains wild and lone, \n
Beside the hoary western sea, \n
Which near the verge of the echoing shore \n
The massy forest shadowed o'er. \n
The ancient steward with hair all hoar, \n
As we alighted, wept to see \n
His master changed so fearfully; \n
And the old man's sobs did waken me \n
From my dream of unremaining gladness; \n
The truth flashed o'er me like quick madness \n
When I looked, and saw that there was death \n
On Lionel. Yet day by day \n
He lived, till fear grew hope and faith, \n
And in my soul I dared to say, \n
Nothing so bright can pass away; \n
Death is dark, and foul, and dull, \n
But he is--oh, how beautiful! \n
Yet day by day he grew more weak, \n
And his sweet voice, when he might speak, \n
Which ne'er was loud, became more low; \n
And the light which flashed through his waxen cheek \n
Grew faint, as the rose-like hues which flow \n
From sunset o'er the Alpine snow; \n
And death seemed not like death in him, \n
For the spirit of life o'er every limb \n
Lingered, a mist of sense and thought. \n
When the summer wind faint odors brought \n
From mountain flowers, even as it passed, \n
His cheek would change, as the noonday sea \n
Which the dying breeze sweeps fitfully. \n
If but a cloud the sky o'ercast, \n
You might see his color come and go, \n
And the softest strain of music made \n
Sweet smiles, yet sad, arise and fade \n
Amid the dew of his tender eyes; \n
And the breath, with intermitting flow, \n
Made his pale lips quiver and part. \n
You might hear the beatings of his heart, \n
Quick but not strong; and with my tresses \n
When oft he playfully would bind \n
In the bowers of mossy lonelinesses \n
His neck, and win me so to mingle \n
In the sweet depth of woven caresses, \n
And our faint limbs were intertwined,-- \n
Alas! the unquiet life did tingle \n
From mine own heart through every vein, \n
Like a captive in dreams of liberty, \n
Who beats the walls of his stony cell. \n
But his, it seemed already free, \n
Like the shadow of fire surrounding me! \n
On my faint eyes and limbs did dwell \n
That spirit as it passed, till soon-- \n
As a frail cloud wandering o'er the moon, \n
Beneath its light invisible, \n
Is seen when it folds its gray wings again \n
To alight on midnight's dusky plain-- \n
I lived and saw, and the gathering soul \n
Passed from beneath that strong control, \n
And I fell on a life which was sick with fear \n
Of all the woe that now I bear. \n
Amid a bloomless myrtle wood, \n
On a green and sea-girt promontory \n
Not far from where we dwelt, there stood, \n
In record of a sweet sad story, \n
An altar and a temple bright \n
Circled by steps, and o'er the gate \n
Was sculptured, 'To Fidelity;' \n
And in the shrine an image sate \n
All veiled; but there was seen the light \n
Of smiles which faintly could express \n
A mingled pain and tenderness \n
Through that ethereal drapery. \n
The left hand held the head, the right-- \n
Beyond the veil, beneath the skin, \n
You might see the nerves quivering within-- \n
Was forcing the point of a barbèd dart \n
Into its side-convulsing heart. \n
An unskilled hand, yet one informed \n
With genius, had the marble warmed \n
With that pathetic life. This tale \n
It told: A dog had from the sea, \n
When the tide was raging fearfully, \n
Dragged Lionel's mother, weak and pale, \n
Then died beside her on the sand, \n
And she that temple thence had planned; \n
But it was Lionel's own hand \n
Had wrought the image. Each new moon \n
That lady did, in this lone fane, \n
The rites of a religion sweet \n
Whose god was in her heart and brain. \n
The seasons' loveliest flowers were strewn \n
On the marble floor beneath her feet, \n
And she brought crowns of sea-buds white \n
Whose odor is so sweet and faint, \n
And weeds, like branching chrysolite, \n
Woven in devices fine and quaint; \n
And tears from her brown eyes did stain \n
The altar; need but look upon \n
That dying statue, fair and wan, \n
If tears should cease, to weep again; \n
And rare Arabian odors came, \n
Through the myrtle copses, steaming thence \n
From the hissing frankincense, \n
Whose smoke, wool-white as ocean foam, \n
Hung in dense flocks beneath the dome-- \n
That ivory dome, whose azure night \n
With golden stars, like heaven, was bright \n
O'er the split cedar's pointed flame; \n
And the lady's harp would kindle there \n
The melody of an old air, \n
Softer than sleep; the villagers \n
Mixed their religion up with hers, \n
And, as they listened round, shed tears. \n
One eve he led me to this fane. \n
Daylight on its last purple cloud \n
Was lingering gray, and soon her strain \n
The nightingale began; now loud, \n
Climbing in circles the windless sky, \n
Now dying music; suddenly \n
'T is scattered in a thousand notes; \n
And now to the hushed ear it floats \n
Like field-smells known in infancy, \n
Then, failing, soothes the air again. \n
We sate within that temple lone, \n
Pavilioned round with Parian stone; \n
His mother's harp stood near, and oft \n
I had awakened music soft \n
Amid its wires; the nightingale \n
Was pausing in her heaven-taught tale. \n
'Now drain the cup,' said Lionel, \n
'Which the poet-bird has crowned so well \n
With the wine of her bright and liquid song! \n
Heard'st thou not sweet words among \n
That heaven-resounding minstrelsy? \n
Heard'st thou not that those who die \n
Awake in a world of ecstasy? \n
That love, when limbs are interwoven, \n
And sleep, when the night of life is cloven, \n
And thought, to the world's dim boundaries clinging, \n
And music, when one beloved is singing, \n
Is death? Let us drain right joyously \n
The cup which the sweet bird fills for me.' \n
He paused, and to my lips he bent \n
His own; like spirit his words went \n
Through all my limbs with the speed of fire; \n
And his keen eyes, glittering through mine, \n
Filled me with the flame divine \n
Which in their orbs was burning far, \n
Like the light of an unmeasured star \n
In the sky of midnight dark and deep; \n
Yes, 't was his soul that did inspire \n
Sounds which my skill could ne'er awaken; \n
And first, I felt my fingers sweep \n
The harp, and a long quivering cry \n
Burst from my lips in symphony; \n
The dusk and solid air was shaken, \n
As swift and swifter the notes came \n
From my touch, that wandered like quick flame, \n
And from my bosom, laboring \n
With some unutterable thing. \n
The awful sound of my own voice made \n
My faint lips tremble; in some mood \n
Of wordless thought Lionel stood \n
So pale, that even beside his cheek \n
The snowy column from its shade \n
Caught whiteness; yet his countenance, \n
Raised upward, burned with radiance \n
Of spirit-piercing joy whose light, \n
Like the moon struggling through the night \n
Of whirlwind-rifted clouds, did break \n
With beams that might not be confined. \n
I paused, but soon his gestures kindled \n
New power, as by the moving wind \n
The waves are lifted; and my song \n
To low soft notes now changed and dwindled, \n
And, from the twinkling wires among, \n
My languid fingers drew and flung \n
Circles of life-dissolving sound, \n
Yet faint; in aëry rings they bound \n
My Lionel, who, as every strain \n
Grew fainter but more sweet, his mien \n
Sunk with the sound relaxedly; \n
And slowly now he turned to me, \n
As slowly faded from his face \n
That awful joy; with look serene \n
He was soon drawn to my embrace, \n
And my wild song then died away \n
In murmurs; words I dare not say \n
We mixed, and on his lips mine fed \n
Till they methought felt still and cold. \n
'What is it with thee, love?' I said; \n
No word, no look, no motion! yes, \n
There was a change, but spare to guess, \n
Nor let that moment's hope be told. \n
I looked,--and knew that he was dead; \n
And fell, as the eagle on the plain \n
Falls when life deserts her brain, \n
And the mortal lightning is veiled again. \n
Oh, that I were now dead! but such-- \n
Did they not, love, demand too much, \n
Those dying murmurs?--he forbade. \n
Oh, that I once again were mad! \n
And yet, dear Rosalind, not so, \n
For I would live to share thy woe. \n
Sweet boy! did I forget thee too? \n
Alas, we know not what we do \n
When we speak words. \n
No memory more \n
Is in my mind of that sea-shore. \n
Madness came on me, and a troop \n
Of misty shapes did seem to sit \n
Beside me, on a vessel's poop, \n
And the clear north wind was driving it. \n
Then I heard strange tongues, and saw strange flowers, \n
And the stars methought grew unlike ours, \n
And the azure sky and the stormless sea \n
Made me believe that I had died \n
And waked in a world which was to me \n
Drear hell, though heaven to all beside. \n
Then a dead sleep fell on my mind, \n
Whilst animal life many long years \n
Had rescued from a chasm of tears; \n
And, when I woke, I wept to find \n
That the same lady, bright and wise, \n
With silver locks and quick brown eyes, \n
The mother of my Lionel, \n
Had tended me in my distress, \n
And died some months before. Nor less \n
Wonder, but far more peace and joy, \n
Brought in that hour my lovely boy. \n
For through that trance my soul had well \n
The impress of thy being kept; \n
And if I waked or if I slept, \n
No doubt, though memory faithless be, \n
Thy image ever dwelt on me; \n
And thus, O Lionel, like thee \n
Is our sweet child. 'T is sure most strange \n
I knew not of so great a change \n
As that which gave him birth, who now \n
Is all the solace of my woe. \n
That Lionel great wealth had left \n
By will to me, and that of all \n
The ready lies of law bereft \n
My child and me,--might well befall. \n
But let me think not of the scorn \n
Which from the meanest I have borne, \n
When, for my child's belovèd sake, \n
I mixed with slaves, to vindicate \n
The very laws themselves do make; \n
Let me not say scorn is my fate, \n
Lest I be proud, suffering the same \n
With those who live in deathless fame. \n
She ceased.--'Lo, where red morning through the woods \n
Is burning o'er the dew!' said Rosalind. \n
And with these words they rose, and towards the flood \n
Of the blue lake, beneath the leaves, now wind \n
With equal steps and fingers intertwined. \n
Thence to a lonely dwelling, where the shore \n
Is shadowed with steep rocks, and cypresses \n
Cleave with their dark green cones the silent skies \n
And with their shadows the clear depths below, \n
And where a little terrace from its bowers \n
Of blooming myrtle and faint lemon flowers \n
Scatters its sense-dissolving fragrance o'er \n
The liquid marble of the windless lake; \n
And where the aged forest's limbs look hoar \n
Under the leaves which their green garments make, \n
They come. 'T is Helen's home, and clean and white, \n
Like one which tyrants spare on our own land \n
In some such solitude; its casements bright \n
Shone through their vine-leaves in the morning sun, \n
And even within 't was scarce like Italy. \n
And when she saw how all things there were planned \n
As in an English home, dim memory \n
Disturbed poor Rosalind; she stood as one \n
Whose mind is where his body cannot be, \n
Till Helen led her where her child yet slept, \n
And said, 'Observe, that brow was Lionel's, \n
Those lips were his, and so he ever kept \n
One arm in sleep, pillowing his head with it. \n
You cannot see his eyes--they are two wells \n
Of liquid love. Let us not wake him yet.' \n
But Rosalind could bear no more, and wept \n
A shower of burning tears which fell upon \n
His face, and so his opening lashes shone \n
With tears unlike his own, as he did leap \n
In sudden wonder from his innocent sleep. \n
So Rosalind and Helen lived together \n
Thenceforth--changed in all else, yet friends again, \n
Such as they were, when o'er the mountain heather \n
They wandered in their youth through sun and rain. \n
And after many years, for human things \n
Change even like the ocean and the wind, \n
Her daughter was restored to Rosalind, \n
And in their circle thence some visitings \n
Of joy 'mid their new calm would intervene. \n
A lovely child she was, of looks serene, \n
And motions which o'er things indifferent shed \n
The grace and gentleness from whence they came. \n
And Helen's boy grew with her, and they fed \n
From the same flowers of thought, until each mind \n
Like springs which mingle in one flood became; \n
And in their union soon their parents saw \n
The shadow of the peace denied to them. \n
And Rosalind--for when the living stem \n
Is cankered in its heart, the tree must fall-- \n
Died ere her time; and with deep grief and awe \n
The pale survivors followed her remains \n
Beyond the region of dissolving rains, \n
Up the cold mountain she was wont to call \n
Her tomb; and on Chiavenna's precipice \n
They raised a pyramid of lasting ice, \n
Whose polished sides, ere day had yet begun, \n
Caught the first glow of the unrisen sun, \n
The last, when it had sunk; and through the night \n
The charioteers of Arctos wheelèd round \n
Its glittering point, as seen from Helen's home, \n
Whose sad inhabitants each year would come, \n
With willing steps climbing that rugged height, \n
And hang long locks of hair, and garlands bound \n
With amaranth flowers, which, in the clime's despite, \n
Filled the frore air with unaccustomed light; \n
Such flowers as in the wintry memory bloom \n
Of one friend left adorned that frozen tomb. \n
Helen, whose spirit was of softer mould, \n
Whose sufferings too were less, death slowlier led \n
Into the peace of his dominion cold. \n
She died among her kindred, being old. \n
And know, that if love die not in the dead \n
As in the living, none of mortal kind \n
Are blessed as now Helen and Rosalind. \n<|endoftext|>
eclogue \n
SCENE, a forest TIME, the Evening \n
In Georgia's land, where Tefflis' towers are seen, \n
In distant view along the level green, \n
While evening dews enrich the glittering glade, \n
And the tall forests cast a longer shade, \n
Amidst the maids of Zagen's peaceful grove, \n
Emyra sung the pleasing cares of love. \n
Of Abra first began the tender strain, \n
Who led her youth with flocks upon the plain. \n
At morn she came those willing flocks to lead, \n
Where lilies rear them in the watery mead; \n
From early dawn the livelong hours she told, \n
Till late at silent ev'n she penned the fold. \n
Deep in the grove beneath the secret shade, \n
A various wreath of odorous flowers she made. \n
Gay-motleyed pinks and sweet jonquils she chose, \n
The violet-blue that on the moss-bank grows; \n
All-sweet to sense, the flaunting rose was there; \n
The finished chaplet well-adorned her hair. \n
Great Abbas chanced that fated morn to stray, \n
By love conducted from the chase away; \n
Among the vocal vales he heard her song, \n
And sought the vales and echoing groves among. \n
At length he found and wooed the rural maid: \n
She knew the monarch, and with fear obeyed. \n
Be every youth like royal Abbas moved, \n
And every Georgian maid like Abra loved. \n
The royal lover bore her from the plain, \n
Yet still her crook and bleating flock remain: \n
Oft as she went, she backward turned her view, \n
And bade that crook and bleating flock adieu. \n
Fair happy maid! to other scenes remove, \n
To richer scenes of golden power and love! \n
Go leave the simple pipe and shepherd's strain, \n
With love delight thee, and with Abbas reign. \n
Be every youth like royal Abbas moved, \n
And every Georgian maid like Abra loved. \n
Yet midst the blaze of courts she fixed her love \n
On the cool fountain or the shady grove; \n
Still with the shepherd's innocence her mind \n
To the sweet vale and flowery mead inclined, \n
And oft as spring renewed the plains with flowers, \n
Breathed his soft gales and led the fragrant hours, \n
With sure return she sought the sylvan scene, \n
The breezy mountains and the forests green. \n
Her maids around her moved, a duteous band! \n
Each bore a crook all-rural in her hand. \n
Some simple lay of flocks and herds they sung; \n
With joy the mountain and the forest rung. \n
Be every youth like royal Abbas moved, \n
And every Georgian maid like Abra loved. \n
And oft the royal lover left the care \n
And thorns of state, attendant on the fair: \n
Oft to the shades and low-roofed cots retired, \n
Or sought the vale where first his heart was fired; \n
A russet mantle, like a swain, he wore, \n
And thought of crowns and busy courts no more. \n
Be every youth like royal Abbas moved, \n
And every Georgian maid like Abra loved. \n
Blest was the life that royal Abbas led: \n
Sweet was his love and innocent his bed. \n
What if in wealth the noble maid excel; \n
The simple shepherd girl can love as well. \n
Let those who rule on Persia's jewelled throne, \n
Be famed for love and gentlest love alone: \n
Or wreathe, like Abbas, full of fair renown, \n
The lover's myrtle with the warrior's crown. \n
Oh happy days! the maids around her say, \n
Oh haste, profuse of blessings, haste away! \n
Be every youth like royal Abbas moved, \n
And every Georgian maid like Abra loved. \n<|endoftext|>
eclogue \n
MELIBOEUS. \n
Tityrus, thou in the shade of a spreading beech-tree reclining, \n
Meditatest, with slender pipe, the Muse of the woodlands. \n
We our country's bounds and pleasant pastures relinquish, \n
We our country fly; thou, Tityrus, stretched in the shadow, \n
Teachest the woods to resound with the name of the fair \n
Amaryllis. \n
TITYRUS. \n
O Meliboeus, a god for us this leisure created, \n
For he will be unto me a god forever; his altar \n
Oftentimes shall imbue a tender lamb from our sheepfolds. \n
He, my heifers to wander at large, and myself, as thou seest, \n
On my rustic reed to play what I will, hath permitted. \n
MELIBOEUS. \n
Truly I envy not, I marvel rather; on all sides \n
In all the fields is such trouble. Behold, my goats I am \n
driving, \n
Heartsick, further away; this one scarce, Tityrus, lead I; \n
For having here yeaned twins just now among the dense hazels, \n
Hope of the flock, ah me! on the naked flint she hath left them. \n
Often this evil to me, if my mind had not been insensate, \n
Oak-trees stricken by heaven predicted, as now I remember; \n
Often the sinister crow from the hollow ilex predicted, \n
Nevertheless, who this god may be, O Tityrus, tell me. \n
TITYRUS. \n
O Meliboeus, the city that they call Rome, I imagined, \n
Foolish I! to be like this of ours, where often we shepherds \n
Wonted are to drive down of our ewes the delicate offspring. \n
Thus whelps like unto dogs had I known, and kids to their \n
mothers, \n
Thus to compare great things with small had I been accustomed. \n
But this among other cities its head as far hath exalted \n
As the cypresses do among the lissome viburnums. \n
MELIBOEUS. \n
And what so great occasion of seeing Rome hath possessed thee? \n
TITYRUS. \n
Liberty, which, though late, looked upon me in my inertness, \n
After the time when my beard fell whiter front me in shaving,-- \n
Yet she looked upon me, and came to me after a long while, \n
Since Amaryllis possesses and Galatea hath left me. \n
For I will even confess that while Galatea possessed me \n
Neither care of my flock nor hope of liberty was there. \n
Though from my wattled folds there went forth many a victim, \n
And the unctuous cheese was pressed for the city ungrateful, \n
Never did my right hand return home heavy with money. \n
MELIBOEUS. \n
I have wondered why sad thou invokedst the gods, Amaryllis, \n
And for whom thou didst suffer the apples to hang on the \n
branches! \n
Tityrus hence was absent! Thee, Tityrus, even the pine-trees, \n
Thee, the very fountains, the very copses were calling. \n
TITYRUS. \n
What could I do? No power had I to escape from my bondage, \n
Nor had I power elsewhere to recognize gods so propitious. \n
Here I beheld that youth, to whom each year, Meliboeus, \n
During twice six days ascends the smoke of our altars. \n
Here first gave he response to me soliciting favor: \n
'Feed as before your heifers, ye boys, and yoke up your \n
bullocks.' \n
MELIBOEUS. \n
Fortunate old man! So then thy fields will be left thee, \n
And large enough for thee, though naked stone and the marish \n
All thy pasture-lands with the dreggy rush may encompass. \n
No unaccustomed food thy gravid ewes shall endanger, \n
Nor of the neighboring flock the dire contagion inject them. \n
Fortunate old man! Here among familiar rivers, \n
And these sacred founts, shalt thou take the shadowy coolness. \n
On this side, a hedge along the neighboring cross-road, \n
Where Hyblaean bees ever feed on the flower of the willow, \n
Often with gentle susurrus to fall asleep shall persuade thee. \n
Yonder, beneath the high rock, the pruner shall sing to the \n
breezes, \n
Nor meanwhile shalt thy heart's delight, the hoarse wood-pigeons, \n
Nor the turtle-dove cease to mourn from aerial elm-trees. \n
TITYRUS. \n
Therefore the agile stags shall sooner feed in the ether, \n
And the billows leave the fishes bare on the sea-shore. \n
Sooner, the border-lands of both overpassed, shall the exiled \n
Parthian drink of the Soane, or the German drink of the Tigris, \n
Than the face of him shall glide away from my bosom! \n
MELIBOEUS. \n
But we hence shall go, a part to the thirsty Afries, \n
Part to Scythia come, and the rapid Cretan Oaxes, \n
And to the Britons from all the universe utterly sundered. \n
Ah, shall I ever, a long time hence, the bounds of my country \n
And the roof of my lowly cottage covered with greensward \n
Seeing, with wonder behold,--my kingdoms, a handful of \n
wheat-ears! \n
Shall an impious soldier possess these lands newly cultured, \n
And these fields of corn a barbarian? Lo, whither dicord \n
Us wretched people hath brought! for whom our fields we have \n
planted! \n
Graft, Meliboeus, thy pear-trees now, put in order thy \n
vine-yards. \n
Go, my goats, go hence, my flocks so happy aforetime. \n
Never again henceforth outstretched in my verdurous cavern \n
Shall I behold you afar from the bushy precipice hanging. \n
Songs no more shall I sing; not with me, ye goats, as your \n
shepherd, \n
Shall ye browse on the bitter willow or blooming laburnum. \n
TITYRUS. \n
Nevertheless, this night together with me canst thou rest thee \n
Here on the verdant leaves; for us there are mellowing apples, \n
Chestnuts soft to the touch, and clouted cream in abundance; \n
And the high roofs now of the villages smoke in the distance, \n
And from the lofty mountains are falling larger the shadows. \n<|endoftext|>
eclogue \n
When December month does come \n
I want to go to the rural districts, back to home \n
and you do ask me what I want to do right there \n
when I can go to parties in the city, be anywhere, \n
while the townsfolk go to the shining sea \n
do party where the lights do shine are happy full of glee? \n
Do you think that rural life does capture a person \n
and at the farm the work does go endlessly on? \n
While we walk from pen to pen do notice cows and some sheep \n
and the thunder does roll far off on the distant hillocks I do breathe deep, \n
do catch the smell of the farmyard; hear in the distance a farmhand shout \n
and under the shade of the old oak tree I want to stretch myself out, \n
do want to see the green cornfields, hear the guinea fowl call. \n
The veldt is full of wonders some great and others small \n
and I want to talk about the days that are gone \n
about how out here God still is the supreme One \n
and I want to hear the calls of birds, the buzzing of bees \n
see the smallest flower and pick fruit from the medlar trees, \n
I want to experience tranquillity \n
find a deep emotion of belonging to a place that is free, \n
a place where everything still is plain. \n
and deep in the veldt for long moments I want to remain, \n
want to wiggle my toes in the hot red sand just for fun \n
and late in the afternoon watch the setting sun. \n

eclogue \n
TO VARUS \n
First my Thalia stooped in sportive mood \n
To Syracusan strains, nor blushed within \n
The woods to house her. When I sought to tell \n
Of battles and of kings, the Cynthian god \n
Plucked at mine ear and warned me: 'Tityrus, \n
Beseems a shepherd-wight to feed fat sheep, \n
But sing a slender song.' Now, Varus, I- \n
For lack there will not who would laud thy deeds, \n
And treat of dolorous wars- will rather tune \n
To the slim oaten reed my silvan lay. \n
I sing but as vouchsafed me; yet even this \n
If, if but one with ravished eyes should read, \n
Of thee, O Varus, shall our tamarisks \n
And all the woodland ring; nor can there be \n
A page more dear to Phoebus, than the page \n
Where, foremost writ, the name of Varus stands. \n
Speed ye, Pierian Maids! Within a cave \n
Young Chromis and Mnasyllos chanced to see \n
Silenus sleeping, flushed, as was his wont, \n
With wine of yesterday. Not far aloof, \n
Slipped from his head, the garlands lay, and there \n
By its worn handle hung a ponderous cup. \n
Approaching- for the old man many a time \n
Had balked them both of a long hoped-for song- \n
Garlands to fetters turned, they bind him fast. \n
Then Aegle, fairest of the Naiad-band, \n
Aegle came up to the half-frightened boys, \n
Came, and, as now with open eyes he lay, \n
With juice of blood-red mulberries smeared him o'er, \n
Both brow and temples. Laughing at their guile, \n
And crying, 'Why tie the fetters? loose me, boys; \n
Enough for you to think you had the power; \n
Now list the songs you wish for- songs for you, \n
Another meed for her' -forthwith began. \n
Then might you see the wild things of the wood, \n
With Fauns in sportive frolic beat the time, \n
And stubborn oaks their branchy summits bow. \n
Not Phoebus doth the rude Parnassian crag \n
So ravish, nor Orpheus so entrance the heights \n
Of Rhodope or Ismarus: for he sang \n
How through the mighty void the seeds were driven \n
Of earth, air, ocean, and of liquid fire, \n
How all that is from these beginnings grew, \n
And the young world itself took solid shape, \n
Then 'gan its crust to harden, and in the deep \n
Shut Nereus off, and mould the forms of things \n
Little by little; and how the earth amazed \n
Beheld the new sun shining, and the showers \n
Fall, as the clouds soared higher, what time the woods \n
'Gan first to rise, and living things to roam \n
Scattered among the hills that knew them not. \n
Then sang he of the stones by Pyrrha cast, \n
Of Saturn's reign, and of Prometheus' theft, \n
And the Caucasian birds, and told withal \n
Nigh to what fountain by his comrades left \n
The mariners cried on Hylas till the shore \n
'Then Re-echoed 'Hylas, Hylas! soothed \n
Pasiphae with the love of her white bull- \n
Happy if cattle-kind had never been!- \n
O ill-starred maid, what frenzy caught thy soul \n
The daughters too of Proetus filled the fields \n
With their feigned lowings, yet no one of them \n
Of such unhallowed union e'er was fain \n
As with a beast to mate, though many a time \n
On her smooth forehead she had sought for horns, \n
And for her neck had feared the galling plough. \n
O ill-starred maid! thou roamest now the hills, \n
While on soft hyacinths he, his snowy side \n
Reposing, under some dark ilex now \n
Chews the pale herbage, or some heifer tracks \n
Amid the crowding herd. Now close, ye Nymphs, \n
Ye Nymphs of Dicte, close the forest-glades, \n
If haply there may chance upon mine eyes \n
The white bull's wandering foot-prints: him belike \n
Following the herd, or by green pasture lured, \n
Some kine may guide to the Gortynian stalls. \n
Then sings he of the maid so wonder-struck \n
With the apples of the Hesperids, and then \n
With moss-bound, bitter bark rings round the forms \n
Of Phaethon's fair sisters, from the ground \n
Up-towering into poplars. Next he sings \n
Of Gallus wandering by Permessus' stream, \n
And by a sister of the Muses led \n
To the Aonian mountains, and how all \n
The choir of Phoebus rose to greet him; how \n
The shepherd Linus, singer of songs divine, \n
Brow-bound with flowers and bitter parsley, spake: \n
'These reeds the Muses give thee, take them thou, \n
Erst to the aged bard of Ascra given, \n
Wherewith in singing he was wont to draw \n
Time-rooted ash-trees from the mountain heights. \n
With these the birth of the Grynean grove \n
Be voiced by thee, that of no grove beside \n
Apollo more may boast him.' Wherefore speak \n
Of Scylla, child of Nisus, who, 'tis said, \n
Her fair white loins with barking monsters girt \n
Vexed the Dulichian ships, and, in the deep \n
Swift-eddying whirlpool, with her sea-dogs tore \n
The trembling mariners? or how he told \n
Of the changed limbs of Tereus- what a feast, \n
What gifts, to him by Philomel were given; \n
How swift she sought the desert, with what wings \n
Hovered in anguish o'er her ancient home? \n
All that, of old, Eurotas, happy stream, \n
Heard, as Apollo mused upon the lyre, \n
And bade his laurels learn, Silenus sang; \n
Till from Olympus, loth at his approach, \n
Vesper, advancing, bade the shepherds tell \n
Their tale of sheep, and pen them in the fold. \n<|endoftext|>
eclogue \n
An eclogue about flowers in my Sexaholic Shopaholic Workaholic series \n
-Gayathri B. Seetharam \n
The only condition that Wikipedia laid out in writing this style of poem is to make it have a pastoral feel or touch. \n
Rustic country sides call for romantic scenes "under the greenwood tree" \n
Or as the Sexaholic, I would love to have been the heroine in Manet's Luncheon on the Grass \n
With my husband and a male friend but this is an impossible equation \n
And hence, I, along with my three degrees in Chemical/Biochemical/Biomedical Engineering \n
Made a beautiful handcrafted flower pot adorned triumphantly with a laurel \n
And a pine cone and 2 roses crafted from wood which has a hardy and ethereal feel \n
Symbolising my journey through my schooling \n
And this has the fresh imaginary scent of the bucolic countryside; \n
But I am a city girl and therein lies the thoroughbred aspect, I feel in my case, \n
And amidst the songs in the wood \n
There has to be the song bird humming its tune \n
In the neighbourhood's High Park \n
And I shall, as a Shopaholic, enjoy the goodness of the pastoral landscape \n
With a walk to the same park and add to it a trip to the florist's \n
To buy rhodendrons and a rose to symbolise the heroine of the scandalous painting \n
And two lupins to signify her male companions and set the flower arrangement \n
In a crystal vase and I must say that a regular vase is a phallic symbol; \n
As a Workaholic, I have made a Flowery Walkway painting which with its beautiful features \n
Leads to the M.Eng and M.A.Sc achieving days of mine at Chem. Eng., U of Toronto \n
And flanks the 18 month research project that I did after a 22 month home stay with my baby boy \n
And later after an unpaid 6 months of working on two technical papers \n
It depicts the three month corporate work period in Iogen Corporation, Ottawa, in my life, \n
And if as Einstein has said, on looking at roses, you can't blame gravity for falling in love \n
I say that on looking at a pastoral landscape like the said painting, one can say that the weight of one's shoulders \n
Will be reduced if one is energised and if one sees the light. \n<|endoftext|>

abc \n
A poem is not more absurd \n
Because its title is no word: \n
And yet that title, although small, \n
Is the great fountain whence spring all. \n
From this most copious source we'll draw \n
Youth, beauty, wedlock, love, and law. \n
The two extremes we'll surely find. \n
Which please and which torment the mind \n
For if we love and law can trace \n
'Twill be sufficient for our case. \n
A parson's work it nicely fits, \n
Who often join two opposites. \n
Nothing on earth the heart can move \n
To pleasure, like that passion love. \n
It reigns triumphant in the breast; \n
Supports and governs all the rest. \n
But Law's a monster that devours \n
The choicest comfort of your hours. \n
All other mischiefs may keep off; \n
Involv'd in law, you've plague enough, \n
This maxim then admits no doubt, \n
He who is in would fain be out. \n
Long dissertations are absurd-- \n
We'll close without another word. \n
THE SECOND PART \n
As much of love shall now be told \n
As ever A. B. C. can hold. \n
That urchin Cupid knows his duty; \n
He'll always shoot a heart for beauty; \n
This he more eagerly will deign, \n
Because he seldom shoots in vain. \n
If Plutus too should give a nod, \n
He's willing to obey the god; \n
For wealth and charms in any state \n
Most certainly will captivate. \n
But if Miss Prudence claims his care, \n
'He seldom has a dart to spare.' \n
Thus what should merit most respect \n
Is apt to meet with most neglect. \n
Of all the pictures earth can boast, \n
A handsome woman pleases most; \n
And the most powerful she appears \n
Over fourteen or fourscore years. \n
The moment you a sight can have, \n
That moment you become her slave. \n
The looker-on is all on fire \n
Either with wonder or desire; \n
Supremely then is beauty bless'd; \n
No creature is like her caress'd. \n
But view the fair in her last stage, \n
Struggling with long decays of age, \n
When kind assistance is most needed, \n
There's not a soul so little heeded. \n
The picture's dash'd, no pity's nigh, \n
The looker-on turns off his eye: \n
In solitude she may abide; \n
Her sov'reign powers are laid aside. \n
That which was most of all high-priz'd. \n
Is now the most of all dispis'd. \n
Only three persons we'll engage, \n
By summons to adorn our page; \n
And all their names must secret be \n
Close shelter'd under A. B. C. \n
Miss A. was tall, and mov'd with grace; \n
Strait, and most beautiful of face; \n
To much good-nature was inclin'd; \n
It play'd both in her face and mind: \n
No wonder then, in deep surprize, \n
B fell a victim to her eyes; \n
For when those eyes but gave a glance, \n
A lover fell-you'd think, by chance. \n
But, should you doubt, then take a view, \n
You'd see her powers--and feel them too: \n
For, like a power that's magical, \n
Spite of yourself you're sure to fall. \n
In lover's eyes are plainly seen \n
The language that is held within. \n
With bowing, smiling, on his part, \n
He found the road that reach'd her heart; \n
While she, a stranger to disdain, \n
Would never let him sue in vain; \n
But, form'd for love, she, without guile, \n
Sweetly return'd him smile for smile. \n
Should, by her eyes, a lover drop, \n
She well knew how to raise him up. \n
Or, if he should a wound endure, \n
She'd perfectly perform a cure. \n
That state of bliss is half divine \n
When two bright flames in one shall join. \n
Can greater happiness remain \n
Than love, and be belov'd again? \n
When two folks are to union prone, \n
Then Hymen's cause moves gently on. \n
To grasp his torch he will not faulter, \n
That he may light them to the altar. \n
Examine whether 'tis in case right, \n
Give it a rap to make it blaze bright. \n
The banns put up, the ring was there, \n
The bride in satin would appear. \n
Now all the joyous blessings flow, \n
Except that time mov'd rather slow. \n
When most delicious fruit is nigh \n
It strongly tempts the stander-by; \n
And if no obstacle is near, \n
It is not easy to forbear. \n
What motive was there to have staid \n
Until the parson grace had said: \n
Our happy B those joys possess'd \n
Design'd to make a husband bless'd. \n
When a stale lover nothing wants, \n
Because he's all the sex e'er grants, \n
Would he call his a happier lot \n
After the priest had tied the knot? \n
For all that ever law has made \n
Only a licence is to trade. \n
No further pleasure B could know; \n
She no more pleasure could bestow: \n
A secret coldness was th' effect, \n
Succeeded by a small neglect. \n
His eyes, which met her eyes with glee, \n
Now rang'd a foot below her knee. \n
A conduct slighting he shew'd to her \n
More like a husband than a wooer. \n
The day pass'd by, indiff'rence planted, \n
Ring, gown, and parson, were not wanted. \n
'And, as the bell for supper rings, \n
I'll stop to say no more fine things.' \n
THE THIRD PART \n
Both law and love compose the past; \n
Poetic justice comes at last. \n
Love, like a blooming rose, is press'd \n
Within the precincts of the breast. \n
The owner often casts an eye, \n
Delighted with the pleasing toy. \n
Perhaps an hour it may not rest \n
Till planted in a second breast. \n
So on, from breast to breast it flies; \n
Wanting a prudent root it dies. \n
A young and handsome man was C; \n
The friend and intimate of B: \n
They oft converse, and notes compare, \n
Of laurels gather'd from the fair. \n
Between these two it was agreed \n
'That B should be compleatly freed \n
Of beauteous A; and C should take her \n
While B for ever should forsake her. \n
That as the banns 'twixt A and B \n
Stood in the church, they'd serve for C; \n
By which they'd save expence and time,' \n
And I procure a word to rhime. \n
Whether Miss A ponder'd a while on't \n
We cannot say; history is silent: \n
Yet no more grief appear'd to view \n
Than changing an old gown for new. \n
But now to church went A and C, \n
And married in the name of B. \n
The joyous day gave great delight; \n
Perhaps more joyous was the night; \n
But, like his predecessor, he \n
Cropp'd the ripe fruit, and left the tree: \n
For soon with matrimony cloy'd \n
He turn'd his tail upon the bride. \n
What though his conduct was absurd, \n
It left her ready for a third. \n
Nor can we think much hard her case \n
Who still commanded half the race. \n
Her beauty'd such a powerful sway \n
'Twould pick a man up ev'ry day. \n
Now while Miss A'd no husband near \n
She liv'd a life of 'as it were.' \n
Her person to support in state \n
Was much inclin'd to run in debt; \n
And when we debts contract, they say, \n
The time will come when we should pay. \n
But if neglect be on our side \n
Compulsive methods must be tried. \n
For common justice holds this tone, \n
'That ev'ry man should have his own.' \n
In vain for cash Miss A being sought \n
Was to the Court of Conscience brought. \n
The plaintiff thus the fair pursued, \n
In C's surname Miss A was sued. \n
The crowd, surpriz'd, began to stare \n
That so much beauty enter'd there. \n
Nay, cold Commissioners, 'tis true, \n
Would lick their lips and steal a view. \n
Thaw'd from the ice by warm desire, \n
A frozen stick will catch the fire; \n
Disguise the passion how you will, \n
'Tis nature, and 'tis nature still. \n
But seniors are not apt to fall; \n
To look and lick their lips is all. \n
A lawyer made appearance there, \n
And loudly pleaded for the fair; \n
Arrang'd his tropes, his figures dress'd, \n
In lofty stile himself express'd: \n
And pray what lawyer would dispute \n
To plead his best in beauty's suit? \n
But what was his retaining fee \n
Is no concern to you or me. \n
He pleaded with decisive air; \n
Resolv'd to win the cause--and fair: \n
'That none an action can support \n
Against a wife in any court. \n
That though her marriage had a flaw \n
It perfectly was good in law; \n
For as the ritual she'd gone through, \n
A wife must be to one of two; \n
And that's her real husband still \n
With whom she said at church I will. \n
Then if the plaintiff will pursue, \n
The husband is the mark in view.' \n
The bench was then my sole delight; \n
My care was parting wrong from right. \n
As I sat president of three, \n
Decision was referr'd to me. \n
'Was perfect beauty ever made \n
To hawk its charms for want of trade? \n
We hope no great defect comes forth \n
To quash the sale of so much worth. \n
That she ne'er chang'd a marriage vow \n
With the first man, we all allow; \n
So far from marrying the dame, \n
He never to the altar came; \n
Nor once commission'd any one \n
By proxy, to make her his own. \n
Nor could she be by right fix'd there, \n
No, not if Madan held the chair; \n
For he'd suppose, without reflection, \n
This might not be her first connexion. \n
Survey the second husband's claim; \n
His title will be found the same: \n
He left both parties in the lurch, \n
And put a trick upon the church. \n
A name that's stolen appears to view; \n
Also a borrow'd person too. \n
No banns put up 'twixt C and A, \n
Which must to wedlock lead the way; \n
For this is what the law demands; \n
On this a union falls or stands; \n
Therefore, if marriage has a flaw, \n
It can't be ratified by law. \n
Then this assertion springs from all; \n
No man can this a wedding call: \n
Or, if it should that phrase invite, \n
'Tis but the wedding of a night; \n
Or like one that is hatch'd up quick \n
By dancing round a candlestick; \n
Or one of military stamp, \n
That's solemniz'd within a camp: \n
The loving couple's plighted word \n
Is only jumping o'er a sword; \n
That sword, intended to divide, \n
Will there unite, and make a bride. \n
Besides, when there appears demur, \n
We must consult the register; \n
And though there should B's name appear, \n
Yet B himself was never there; \n
and if for C you chuse to look, \n
His name was never in the book. \n
This wedding's founded on no laws; \n
We must, of course, dismiss the cause; \n
For as a husband A ne'er knew, \n
No husband can the plaintiff sue; \n
But if he will pursue his claim, \n
May still sue A in her own name. \n
There's one delightful word we see \n
Compos'd of our A B and C. \n
To girls, whose flimzy virtue lies \n
Quite dormant, and whose passions rise, \n
That dear word husband stands the first \n
Of all the alphabet can boast: \n
In that cornpriz'd is every thing \n
That either Heaven or Earth can bring; \n
But, when that blessing husband's granted, \n
Then ev'ry other blessing's wanted.' \n
A, rather out of credit grown, \n
Display'd her charms upon the town. \n
'But why in Birmingham appear \n
Among the dirty bunters there? \n
Whose manners are a foul disgrace; \n
A satire on the female race. \n
She might a constellation rise, \n
And figure in the London skies; \n
Could charms display as bright as any, \n
In evenings when it was not rainy.' \n
'Tis done--and she acquir'd renown, \n
As the first beauty on the town. \n
Dress'd in the pink, she took her stand \n
Among the ladies of the Strand. \n
Thus beauty, by imprudent steps, \n
To sure destruction slowly creeps. \n
For she, when to that bevy's got in, \n
Takes much about three years to rot in. \n
The silent priest \n
We'll tell simple truth, and our story comes pat, \n
No matter if acted in this age or that. \n
Dear Friend, let us saunter to Baxterly church, \n
Where good Mr. D--left himself in the lurch; \n
For there the gay hearer will, sure as a gun, \n
Meet with a sweet morsal of high-season'd fun. \n
The pray'rs being ended, and no blunder made, \n
The Clerk his desk mounted--he well knew his trade; \n
Two staves out of Sternhold he struck up compleat, \n
While climbing the pulpit the Priest took his seat. \n
Now heav'nly music, a Clerk's highest boast, \n
Calm'd every breast, but the Vicar's the most. \n
The psalm being over, deep silence came next; \n
Not a single breath sounded, expecting the text; \n
But, to the surprize of the serious and gay, \n
The Vicar himself was as silent as they; \n
For he'd dropt to sleep, being drench'd with mild ale, \n
And dream'd of full bumpers, the last night's regale; \n
Or, rather, till five in the morning had hanker'd, \n
Before he could find the last drop in the tankard. \n
Now the congregation became rather wild, \n
They look'd at the Priest, at each other, and smil'd. \n
If a shepherd should fall fast asleep in the day, \n
No wonder his flock goes a little astray. \n
Then Moses look'd up--'Sir, we've done,' cried Amen; \n
The Priest, half awake, replied, 'Fill it agen.' \n<|endoftext|>

I’m scared terrified beyond my worst nightmare \n
Alight with emotions raw and bare as the open soil just after ploughing \n
I don’t understand, can’t avoid-won’t admit \n
Boldness: lost and exchanged for involuntary bashfulness \n
I care for u-about your occasional cold, your state of mind everything: gosh-is it wrong to do so? \n
Carelessly I drift into a different world-one where light flashes across one’s face blurring logical reasoning \n
I like hearing from u-a mere “hi” sends my tiny heart fluttering above my head \n
Dare not: say a word for the tiny rope I hang onto would leave me timidly on the floor \n
I dream of having a full conversation with u: just to spend time enveloped in an atmosphere of tranquil \n
Eager beaver I am: yet I shudder to imagine such \n
I’d fidget around for a while: such is expected for flesh alone can’t carry the weight of feeling so \n
Flowing through my veins-my heart-my body: my being blood of passion \n
I feel like our souls are intoxicatingly bound by forces beyond our own control-playing us for fools \n
Grasping at invisible strands that keep us in control of what we don’t others to see \n
You are more than just an acquaintance, a companion an interest \n
Heaven-sent, sun-kissed, mind-blowing out of this world \n
You awaken parts within me: I’ve known never to exist Alas: my fickle heart \n
Idleness overpowered drowning in pools of confusion, losing the very essence of me \n
You have a power I wish I could take away: the influence-the strength aiding my helplessness \n
Just as a fledgeling surrenders to motherly nurturing: I depend \n
You are a dream that has evolved into reality \n
Kinder words I can’t express tongue-tied I’ve become \n
You are imperfectly you- drawing me closer to that which I refuse to surrender to \n
Let me be…for such I can’t handle-set I free break my chains \n
You hold the keys to happiness, deeper existence, worthwhile peace \n
A chest-full of secrets and answers \n
Magical, manipulative, melodious, mellow, miraculous, misunderstood, momentous, mortifyingly-merry, mythical LOVE CAN NOT BE FOR EVERYONE…SOME OF US FEEL THE NEED TO BE: \n
Free as the bird flying high-gazing upon mountains of flowers blossoming under the blazing sun Watching as creatures on the land toil away Foolish yet safe \n
As painful as it is: And forever it shall be: I sacrifice You-not because of selfishness, pity nor any fault But because I CARE GO on Break away- for I am not Brave enough! O Sweet misery \n

inner peace: a to z (© Raj Arumugam, September 2008) \n
Inner peace is effortless, as it’s always there within. \n
One just has to see it. \n
And once one truly sees this inner peace – not with words or just \n
intellectually, but actually see this inner peace within – it is one’s, always; \n
no one takes away that… \n
Nothing and no evil and no violent force or even the most difficult \n
of circumstances in one’s life can remove that inner peace that one \n
sees within; but let one see this not as a word, or as a phrase \n
but as an actuality. \n
Feel that peace, see that inner peace and let it radiate always – for it is \n
the harmony within each and it is always one’s own. \n
A \n
Let amity be your constant companion….Be at peace with all beings, equally at peace with those near and those far, and thus walk hand in hand with amity as in a bounteous garden… \n
B \n
Be mindful of your blessings always…To be alive, to breathe in fresh air; \n
and to be with the family and the companionship of good fellow-human \n
beings; and the kindness of strangers; and the creatures of this world \n
and the flowers that bloom, and to have a place in this marvelous planet \n
of ours….all these too are blessings…. \n
There is a life of the body in the domain of the physical, and \n
the legitimate needs of the body are just as important as \n
one’s inner needs… \n
C \n
Think critically….even while we love and are at peace with the world, \n
do not forget to think critically for oneself so that one is not the fool \n
of the cunning…and thus thinking for oneself carefully and critically \n
one keeps one’s time and energy and one’s own mind…. \n
Do your own thinking; allowing others to do your thinking for you \n
is to systematically lose one's will to live life to its fullest... \n
Freshness comes when one discards clichés in word, thought and \n
deed – and with freshness comes vigor, steadiness and wisdom…. \n
Though one may mature and grow in intellect, let the child be in \n
you always. For each moment in which one ceases to be a child, \n
one is but walking dead. \n
D \n
Death is only part of a process in our lives….it is but another phase \n
as is one’s birth…. \n
Witness the wonder of this process and constant change, and \n
marvel at it as one marvels at sunset and sunrise – and thus is there \n
no agony or ecstasy but quiet and cool contemplation of birth, our day to day \n
living and death….the whole of which is life... \n
Die to each moment; die to each memory and die to each event \n
and each day - and thus is there constant renewal and the ever new, \n
and so one sees for oneself there is truly no fear in death. \n
E \n
…equanimity is priceless...there is no need for wildness in joy or agony; \n
as the tides come and go so do our mental states, and all that we consider \n
bad or good….like the rise of the moon, or the coming of the stars \n
and the going of the stars are our emotions and our lives and our happiness \n
and sorrows….see them for what they are and equanimity dwells shining \n
within one always…. \n
F \n
The free mind is the greatest blessing….Be free of conditioning and \n
be free of propaganda; be free of identity and of the group, and one is truly \n
free; be free of the past in all its forms as it arises in the mind as \n
remembrance of hurts and wrongs, and be free of the future as it arises \n
as constant planning and anticipation and unnecessary tension…. \n
But what is the free mind? One is not free who allows it be defined \n
for one. \n
Be free of anyone who will teach you: there is no relative \n
freedom – only complete freedom… \n
During one’s meeting or interaction with another being – any being, \n
human or creature - be mindful of the question: Am I fair to this being? \n
And after one’s meeting or interaction with another being – any being, \n
human or creature - be mindful of the question: Have I been fair to this being? \n
G \n
There is grace in your heart, in your mind and in your very being…delve deep within and see it - let it glow, and that grace will show in the smoothness of your very movement and speech; and that grace will flow in your manner, and that grace will fill your life and each moment with peace, charm and joy…. \n
God? I have no use for God as I have no use for clichés. \n
H \n
Neglect no aspect of your being – for each aspect of your being is necessary and good. \n
Find for yourself all dimensions of your being…see what happens and what you need in each dimension…be moderate and sufficient in each dimension, and there will be no tension there in any of your dimensions of your being, and thus harmony is yours…. \n
I \n
Insight is when you can see beyond words and the intellect…as when one feels the presence of love and wisdom...let your insight and your intuition live and flourish – for to suppress it is to deny yourself wisdom and inner light… \n
Words are useless and mislead in the inner life and therefore it is in the light of insight and intuition that one has direct seeing of what actually is…. \n
J \n
Rejoice in the joys of others...rejoice in the happiness of others…rejoice in \n
your own joy…find the joy within yourself and the joy in the world… \n
Be fair and just – not so that one may be loved by others or so one may escape punishment or so one may enter heaven, but be just for its own intrinsic beauty. \n
K \n
There is a kingdom within that is not by any other but oneself….there is chaos there if one rules unwisely, and there is joy and harmony if one enters \n
in wisdom….peace and harmony radiate there in that kingdom of your \n
own wisdom, and not by the power or grace or authority or wisdom of \n
others…No being, however mighty and however supernatural, can effect \n
order in there…The kingdom is only of oneself and yet in oneness… \n
Enter therefore your own kingdom wisely, enter in your own wisdom… \n
L \n
All that there is in the world is love….All the many and countless words \n
and revelations and traditions and systems are all but love…. \n
All the world’s Holy Books and Revelations and Sermons are useless – there is only love… \n
The love in which there is conflict or tension, the love in which one \n
seeks to own or possess or to carve out a territory or group or personal \n
identity or salvation or gain or protection – that is not love… \n
The love that includes all and that excludes none, the love that knows \n
no hate or violence or tension or expectation or punishment \n
or reward – that is love…. \n
We have allowed the idea and myth of God to replace the reality \n
of Love: forget about God for the only reality is Love… \n
We are liars…we are drugged by lies and \n
addicted to lies…but while it is easy to see the lies told to one or the \n
lies one tells others, it is more difficult to see the lies one tells oneself… \n
M \n
Be mindful of the moment….be mindful of one’s breath – of the breath as one exhales, as one inhales…be mindful of the emotion or thought that arises, that lives and that subsides… \n
....with no censure, no judgment, no labels, no memory-making and cherishing of experiences…be mindful too of walking or of sitting; be mindful of each act and thought… \n
And so does one live the moment and so thought and time - the past and future - lose their tyrannical hold on the mind… \n
N \n
Be mindful too of the nuances of the words we utter and use; be mindful of the nuances of one’s speech and actions and one’s silence and one’s inaction… \n
O \n
Observe with no imprint…observe with no judgment or residue…observe what actually is… \n
observing a tree \n
You see the tree….see what is; see it as it is, not with all of one's conditioning…you look…one does not form a judgment and an attachment and a craving for a repetition of this event - but just observe with no labels…no naming…one sees what is there before one without a name, for the name is the past…just observe what is… \n
observing the mind \n
One observes what is – one observes one’s mind, oneself - not as what authority says one is, but as one actually sees oneself; direct and straight seeing oneself… \n
One sees oneself without the conditioning and with no prejudice; one sees what actually is… \n
One observes the activities of the mind…one sees the emotion or thought that arises, as it lives and as it subsides…one does not name the emotion or thought, for to do so is to bring in conditioning which is the tyranny of thought; one does not label it and one does not feel guilt or like or dislike…one merely observes what actually is… \n
One who observes one’s mind knows oneself – not oneself as some abstract and superhuman eternal entity, but as one is….Not second-hand - but directly, for oneself... \n
Not as what tradition or scriptures or science or reports tell us what we are – but as one actually observes and as one sees what is… \n
How can one know anything without knowing oneself? Of what use is your knowing of all that you know without self-knowledge as you actually are, and not according to some theory or report or ideology? \n
P \n
There are things and events you have control of – and how you pace these that are within your control determines how much peace and quiet there is in your heart… \n
Know then the rhythm at which your mind moves and pace the events you \n
have control of at this rhythm… \n
For things one has no control of, one’s wisdom will bring a harmony between one and what faces one… \n
..inner peace is never lost; it’s always there just below the apparent surface of discord. One simply dives deep enough to see this peace that pervades and that never leaves one, though one may be distracted by insistent diversions… \n
Q \n
It may seem one’s life is a quest and one searches and searches - and yet in that moment of awareness, of full attention, one sees there is no search, there is no arriving – for it is always there, it is always here and now… \n
There is no such thing as a quest; there is no such thing as a search… \n
R \n
Rest well….one forgets in one’s hurry that simple rest can revitalize and bring freshness… \n
S \n
Speak gently, speak quietly; speak words that soothe and heal, and with no intent to hurt. Speak words that bring amity, calm and peace and not words that promote division, anarchy and discord. \n
T \n
Thought may be the remembrance of cultures and technology that move societies forward, but thought can be mostly of the past that is a burden… \n
Be free of the past then and make no memory of it; for the past restricts and narrows and confines, and not making a memory of it is freedom…. \n
U \n
The world’s systems and hierarchy and Revelations aspire to drag everyone into uniformity and mediocrity… \n
To lead or to follow is to be mediocre – and the mediocre cannot allow independence… \n
This world of set formulas and systems despises free inquiry and wants to see each one of us the same in mind and habit and thought: it demands we crawl into its traditions and prescribed or revealed creed, and to fit into what it teaches is the way to be… \n
The world says this is the way things are and expects one to conform or to break… \n
Know what you are, know yourself - or the world subtly but swiftly transforms you into itself… \n
See what actually is rather than going the set ways of what one likes it to be or what should or ought to be or what is described to be …Discard all authority and see for yourself what actually is… \n
V \n
Let there be vigor in all things one does; let there be vigor in thought, in \n
one’s inquiry, in one’s speech and in one’s works and deeds. \n
The most inspired moment in one’s life is when vision unfolds \n
naturally within; dullness comes of conditioning and beliefs that are \n
the companions of complacent inquiry. \n
W \n
There is no treasure like the treasure of wisdom for with wisdom one sees \n
the unmediated truth of life and the radiant truth of lasting joy in all circumstances. \n
Wide is the world and yet we seek to cut it and to confine it \n
and to create borders; wide is the mind and yet many seek \n
to constrict it and to set up boundaries and to restrict its space. \n
X \n
Avoid extremes in all matters – for it is it is the wisdom of moderation that universally promotes balance, health, happiness and calm. \n
Y \n
In one’s intellect let there be maturity and completeness and the wisdom of ages; but in one’s inquiry into life let there be vigor and newness and perennial youth. \n
Z \n
There are no confined zones in true love: love knows no boundaries and love knows no borders – the wide universe is the very home of love. \n
That inner peace radiates in the stars and in the trees and in the grass; that inner peace radiates in the creatures of the earth and in all living things and in the very air…That inner peace pervades all beings, all life and all existence. \n<|endoftext|>

lament \n
Even a tall person to a short person, \n
their problems I can relate, \n
tall people bump into low hanging doors, \n
while short people cannot reach shelves too high. \n
In shops there are no normal shelves, \n
some are near the ceiling, \n
while others are inches from the floor. \n
Normally the good stuff is put on the top shelf, \n
where you need a pair of stilts to reach. \n
Therefore, the short person has to jump up and down, \n
just like a jack in the box, \n
for anything they want. \n
Some short people feel intimidated, \n
by the tall people that they meet. \n
They should not be, \n
because size is not the difference, \n
but its personalities. \n
Now if they worked together, \n
they could walk at the same height. \n
No man is different from another, \n
no matter what size he is. \n
So short and tall people of this word, \n
I have but one word for both of you - unite. \n<|endoftext|>

lament \n
Flowers in their freshness are flushing the earth, \n
And the voice-peopled forest is loud in its mirth, \n
And streams in their fulness are laughing at dearth— \n
Yet my bosom is aching. \n
There’s shadow on all things—the shadow of woe— \n
It falls from my spirit wherever I go, \n
As from a dark cloud drifting heavy and slow, \n
For my spirit is weary. \n
Ah! what can be flowers in their gladness to me, \n
Or the voices that people the green forest tree, \n
Or the full joy of streams—since my soul sighs, ah me! \n
O’er the grave of my Mary. \n
Under the glad face of nature, her face \n
Hath carried down with it all beauty and grace; \n
Pale is it there in that dark silent place— \n
Mary! oh Mary! \n
Children are by me—her children; oh God! \n
To see where their feet have unwittingly trod, \n
Tiny tracks in the loam of the new broken sod \n
Betwixt them and their mother! \n
Betwixt them and the true one who loved us in truth, \n
Who bore them, and died ’mid the hopes of her youth! \n
Who would live in a world where nor anguish nor ruth \n
May avail the bereaved ones. \n
Yet must I live, lest her spirit should say, \n
Meeting mine in its flight from this vesture of clay, \n
“Where are our little ones? Where do they stay? \n
And why did you leave them?” \n
If for them only, then, so must it be, \n
See, I remain with them, Mary! but see \n
How lonely we stand in a world without thee! \n
Mary! oh Mary! \n
I live, but death’s shadow is over me cast; \n
And even when wearied woe sleepeth at last, \n
Some dream of the dead, sighing out of the past, \n
Is alive in the darkness! \n
Could I but weep, it were comfort, though brief; \n
But the fountain of tears by the fire of my grief \n
Hath been dried to its dregs, and can shed no relief \n
On the thirst of my eyelids. \n
As music that wasteth away on the blast, \n
As the last ray by the sunken sun cast, \n
All my heart’s gladness hath died in the past,— \n
Mary! oh Mary! \n<|endoftext|>
lament \n
I. \n
IN old Shuil Donald's cottage there are many voices weeping, \n
And stifled sobs, and murmurings of sorrow wild and vain, \n
For the old man's cherish'd blessing on her bed of death lies sleeping,-- \n
The sleep from which no human wish can rouse her soul again. \n
Oh, dark are now those gentle eyes which shone beneath their lashes \n
So full of laughter and of love--it seems but yesterday-- \n
Well may Shuil Donald mourn beside his hearth's forsaken ashes, \n
His lily of the valley is wither'd away! \n
II. \n
The spring shall come to other hearts with breezes and with showers, \n
But lonely winter still shall reign in old Shuil Donald's home; \n
Others may raise the song of joy, and laugh away the hours, \n
But he--oh! never more may joy to his lone dwelling come. \n
Her name shall be an empty sound, in idle converse spoken, \n
Forgotten shall she be by those who mourn her most to-day-- \n
All, all but one, who wanders with his Highland spirit broken, \n
His lily of the valley is wither'd away! \n
III. \n
And he--long, long, at even-tide, when sunset rays are gleaming, \n
That sad old man shall sit within his lonely cottage door, \n
Desolate, desolate shall sit, and muse with idle dreaming \n
On days when her returning step came quick across the moor. \n
Oh! never more her quiet smile, her cheerful voice of greeting, \n
Shall rouse to warmth his aged heart, when darkly sinks the day-- \n
Never, oh! never more on earth those loved ones may be meeting-- \n
His lily of the valley is wither'd away! \n<|endoftext|>
lament \n
Just a line to say I'm living, \n
that I'm not among the dead, \n
though I'm getting more forgetful \n
and mixed up in the head. \n
I got used to my arthritis, \n
to my dentures I'm resigned, \n
I can manage my bifocals \n
but God I miss my mind, \n
For sometimes I can't remember, \n
when I stand at the foot of the stairs, \n
if I must go up for something, \n
or have just come down from there. \n
And before the fridge so often, \n
my poor mind is filled with doubt, \n
have I just put food away, \n
or have I come to take some out? \n
So if it's my turn to write to you, \n
there's no need for getting sore, \n
I may think that I have written \n
and don't want to be a bore. \n
So, remember that I love you \n
and wish that you were near \n
but now it's nearly mail time \n
so I must say good-bye dear, \n
There I stand beside the mailbox \n
with a face so very red, \n
instead of mailing you my letter, \n
I opened it instead! \n<|endoftext|>
lament \n
Sorrow is my own yard \n
where the new grass \n
flames as it has flamed \n
often before but not \n
with the cold fire \n
that closes round me this year. \n
Thirtyfive years \n
I lived with my husband. \n
The plumtree is white today \n
with masses of flowers. \n
Masses of flowers \n
load the cherry branches \n
and color some bushes \n
yellow and some red \n
but the grief in my heart \n
is stronger than they \n
for though they were my joy \n
formerly, today I notice them \n
and turn away forgetting. \n
Today my son told me \n
that in the meadows, \n
at the edge of the heavy woods \n
in the distance, he saw \n
trees of white flowers. \n
I feel that I would like \n
to go there \n
and fall into those flowers \n
and sink into the marsh near them. \n<|endoftext|>
lament \n
(Soldiers and Children of War) \n
Long days gone, long nights perilous in their wake, smoky haze for days to come, \n
Lives blotted, eyes forlorn, raging storms in the heart of the land as too outside \n
Do we live but to pick up the pieces, weave minds, build homes, and heal bones, \n
Dreaming and living, re-living the dreams, of a life gone past \n
or does it all start from tomorrow? \n
Is there an end in sight, oh men in shirts planning and signing off battles on desks \n
Have you strategically drawn up sweaty palms nursing broken homes \n
Stringing bloody pearls, patching gory wounds, oh their weary existence \n
Living on puddles, river water, running red for days of sorrow, miles from home \n
Broken men, weeping women, lost children building villages? \n
Who absolves whom when eyes and voices plead and hands pray for mercy \n
Old folk, with the weak swallowed, the fallen to be hidden by dusty mounds \n
Will this soon be forgotten with long smoky days and haunting vivid nights \n
Or is it a life time with the turning season but with no hope for me, for us, \n
Oh! men in crisp shirts planning and scheming on your desks or heavens above? \n
Tell me, who else sees what I see, where do I search for those seeking the day \n
When broken homes are nursed by healed bones, gory minds building villages \n
Broken men and weeping women searching for things they once knew \n
When red rivers of sorrow shimmer in the opaque silver moon with a vibrant new life \n
A smoky lazy haze welcoming the end in sight...just heavens above? \n

O MY land! O my love! \n
What a woe, and how deep, \n
Is thy death to my long mourning soul! \n
God alone, God above, \n
Can awake thee from sleep, \n
Can release thee from bondage and dole! \n
Alas, alas, and alas! \n
For the once proud people of Banba! \n
As a tree in its prime, \n
Which the axe layeth low, \n
Didst thou fall, O unfortunate land! \n
Not by time, nor thy crime, \n
Came the shock and the blow. \n
They were given by a false felon hand! \n
Alas, alas, and alas! \n
For the once proud people of Banba! \n
O, my grief of all griefs \n
Is to see how thy throne \n
Is usurped, whilst thyself art in thrall! \n
Other lands have their chiefs, \n
Have their kings, thou alone \n
Art a wife, yet a widow withal! \n
Alas, alas, and alas! \n
For the once proud people of Banba! \n
The high house of O’Neill \n
Is gone down to the dust, \n
The O’Brien is clanless and banned; \n
And the steel, the red steel \n
May no more be the trust \n
Of the Faithful and Brave in the land! \n
Alas, alas, and alas! \n
For the once proud people of Banba! \n
True, alas! Wrong and Wrath \n
Were of old all too rife. \n
Deeds were done which no good man admires \n
And perchance Heaven hath \n
Chastened us for the strife \n
And the blood-shedding ways of our sires! \n
Alas, alas, and alas! \n
For the once proud people of Banba! \n
But, no more! This our doom, \n
While our hearts yet are warm, \n
Let us not over weakly deplore! \n
For the hour soon may loom \n
When the Lord’s mighty hand \n
Shall be raised for our rescue once more! \n
And all our grief shall be turned into joy \n
For the still proud people of Banba! \n<|endoftext|>
lament \n
See, he sitteth on his mat \n
Sitteth there upright, \n
With the grace with which he sat \n
While he saw the light. \n
Where is now the sturdy gripe,-- \n
Where the breath sedate, \n
That so lately whiffed the pipe \n
Toward the Spirit great? \n
Where the bright and falcon eye, \n

On the waving grass could spy, \n
Thick with dewdrops spread? \n

Swifter through the snow \n

Bent the deadly bow? \n
See, its life hath fleeted by,-- \n
See, it hangeth low! \n
Happy he!--He now has gone \n
Where no snow is found: \n
Where with maize the fields are sown, \n
Self-sprung from the ground; \n
Where with birds each bush is filled, \n
Where with game the wood; \n
Where the fish, with joy unstilled, \n
Wanton in the flood. \n
With the spirits blest he feeds,-- \n
Leaves us here in gloom; \n
We can only praise his deeds, \n
And his corpse entomb. \n
Farewell-gifts, then, hither bring, \n
Sound the death-note sad! \n
Bury with him everything \n
That can make him glad! \n
'Neath his head the hatchet hide \n

And the bear's fat haunch beside, \n
For the road is long; \n
And the knife, well sharpened, \n
That, with slashes three, \n
Scalp and skin from foeman's head \n
Tore off skilfully. \n
And to paint his body, place \n
Dyes within his hand; \n
Let him shine with ruddy grace \n
In the Spirit-land! \n<|endoftext|>
lament \n
I climb the highest cliff; I hear the sound \n
Of dashing waves; I gaze intent around; \n
I mark the gray cope, and the hollowness \n
Of heaven, and the great sun, that comes to bless \n
The isles again; but my long-straining eye, \n
No speck, no shadow can, far off, descry, \n
That I might weep tears of delight, and say, \n
It is the bark that bore my child away! \n
Sun, that returnest bright, beneath whose eye \n
The worlds unknown, and out-stretched waters lie, \n
Dost thou behold him now! On some rude shore, \n
Around whose crags the cheerless billows roar, \n
Watching the unwearied surges doth he stand, \n
And think upon his father's distant land! \n
Or has his heart forgot, so far away, \n
These native woods, these rocks, and torrents gray, \n
The tall bananas whispering to the breeze, \n
The shores, the sound of these encircling seas, \n
Heard from his infant days, and the piled heap \n
Of holy stones, where his forefathers sleep! \n
Ah, me! till sunk by sorrow, I shall dwell \n
With them forgetful in the narrow cell, \n
Never shall time from my fond heart efface \n
His image; oft his shadow I shall trace \n
Upon the glimmering waters, when on high \n
The white moon wanders through the cloudless sky. \n
Oft in my silent cave, when to its fire \n
From the night's rushing tempest we retire, \n
I shall behold his form, his aspect bland; \n
I shall retrace his footsteps on the sand; \n
And, when the hollow-sounding surges swell, \n
Still think I listen to his echoing shell. \n
Would I had perished ere that hapless day, \n
When the tall vessel, in its trim array, \n
First rushed upon the sounding surge, and bore \n
My age's comfort from this sheltering shore! \n
I saw it spread its white wings to the wind, \n
Too soon it left these hills and woods behind, \n
Gazing, its course I followed till mine eye \n
No longer could its distant track descry; \n
Till on the confines of the billows hoar \n
A while it hung, and then was seen no more, \n
And only the blue hollow cope I spied, \n
And the long waste of waters tossing wide. \n
More mournful then each falling surge I heard, \n
Then dropt the stagnant tear upon my beard. \n
Methought the wild waves said, amidst their roar \n
At midnight, Thou shalt see thy son no more! \n
Now thrice twelve moons through the mid heavens have rolled \n
And many a dawn, and slow night, have I told: \n
And still as every weary day goes by, \n
A knot recording on my line I tie; \n
But never more, emerging from the main, \n
I see the stranger's bark approach again. \n
Has the fell storm o'erwhelmed him! Has its sweep \n
Buried the bounding vessel in the deep! \n
Is he cast bleeding on some desert plain! \n
Upon his father did he call in vain! \n
Have pitiless and bloody tribes defiled \n
The cold limbs of my brave, my beauteous child! \n
Oh! I shall never, never hear his voice; \n
The spring-time shall return, the isles rejoice, \n
But faint and weary I shall meet the morn, \n
And 'mid the cheering sunshine droop forlorn! \n
The joyous conch sounds in the high wood loud, \n
O'er all the beach now stream the busy crowd; \n
Fresh breezes stir the waving plantain grove; \n
The fisher carols in the winding cove; \n
And light canoes along the lucid tide \n
With painted shells and sparkling paddles glide. \n
I linger on the desert rock alone, \n
Heartless, and cry for thee, my son, my son. \n<|endoftext|>

Silence instead of thy sweet song, my bird, \n
Which through the darkness of my winter days \n
Warbling of summer sunshine still was heard; \n
Mute is thy song, and vacant is thy place. \n
The spring comes back again, the fields rejoice, \n
Carols of gladness ring from every tree; \n
But I shall hear thy wild triumphant voice \n
No more: my summer song has died with thee. \n
What didst thou sing of, O my summer bird? \n
The broad, bright, brimming river, whose swift sweep \n
And whirling eddies by the home are heard, \n
Rushing, resistless, to the calling deep. \n
What didst thou sing of, thou melodious sprite? \n
Pine forests, with smooth russet carpets spread, \n
Where e'en at noonday dimly falls the light, \n
Through gloomy blue-green branches overhead. \n
What didst thou sing of, O thou jubilant soul? \n
Ever-fresh flowers and never-leafless trees, \n
Bending great ivory cups to the control \n
Of the soft swaying, orange scented breeze. \n
What didst thou sing of, thou embodied glee? \n
The wide wild marshes with their clashing reeds \n
And topaz-tinted channels, where the sea \n
Daily its tides of briny freshness leads. \n
What didst thou sing of, O thou winged voice? \n
Dark, bronze-leaved oaks, with silver mosses crowned, \n
Where thy free kindred live, love, and rejoice, \n
With wreaths of golden jasmine curtained round. \n
These didst thou sing of, spirit of delight! \n
From thy own radiant sky, thou quivering spark! \n
These thy sweet southern dreams of warmth and light, \n
Through the grim northern winter drear and dark. \n<|endoftext|>

Sweet songs excite, from the far dawn \n

lament \n
Good ladies, you that have your pleasure in exile, \n
Step in your foot, come take a place, and mourn with me a while, \n
And such as by their lords do set but little price, \n
Let them sit still: it skills them not what chance come on the dice. \n
But ye whom Love hath bound by order of desire \n
To love your lords, whose good deserts none other would require: \n
Come you yet once again, and set your foot by mine, \n
Whose woeful plight and sorrows great no tongue may well define. \n
My love and lord, alas, in whom consists my wealth, \n
Hath fortune sent to pass the seas in hazard of his health. \n
That I was wont for to embrace, contented mind's, \n
Is now amid the foaming floods at pleasure of the winds. \n
There God him well preserve, and safely me him send, \n
Without which hope, my life alas were shortly at an end. \n
Whose absence yet, although my hope doth tell me plain, \n
With short return he comes anon, yet ceaseth not my pain. \n
The fearful dreams I have, oft times they grieve me so, \n
That then I wake and stand in doubt, if they be true, or no. \n
Sometime the roaring seas, me seems, they grow so high, \n
That my sweet lord in danger great, alas, doth often lie. \n
Another time the same doth tell me, he is come; \n
And playing, where I shall him find with T., his little son. \n
So forth I go apace to see that liefsome sight, \n
And with a kiss me thinks I say: "Now welcome home, my knight; \n
Welcome my sweet, alas, the stay of my welfare; \n
Thy presence bringeth forth a truce betwixt me and my care." \n
Then lively doth he look, and salveth me again, \n
And saith: "My dear, how is it now that you have all this pain?" \n
Wherewith the heavy cares that heap'd are in my breast, \n
Break forth, and me dischargeth clean of all my huge unrest. \n
But when I me awake and find it but a dream, \n
The anguish of my former woe beginneth more extreme, \n
And me tormenteth so, that uneath may I find \n
Some hidden where, to steal the grief of my unquiet mind. \n
Thus every way you see with absence how I burn; \n
And for my wound no cure there is but hope of good return; \n
Save when I feel, by sour how sweet is felt the more, \n
It doth abate some of my pains that I abode before. \n
And then unto myself I say: "When that we two shall meet, \n
But little time shall seem this pain, that joy shall be so sweet." \n
Ye winds, I you convert in chiefest of your rage, \n
That you my lord me safely send, my sorrows to assuage; \n
And that I may not long abide in such excess, \n
Do your good will to cure a wight that liveth in distress. \n<|endoftext|>

Nae mair to me the Autumn winds \n

elegy \n
About a year has passed. I've returned to the place of the battle, \n
to its birds that have learned their unfolding of wings \n
from a subtle \n
lift of a surprised eyebrow, or perhaps from a razor blade \n
- wings, now the shade of early twilight, now of state \n
bad blood. \n
Now the place is abuzz with trading \n
in your ankles's remnants, bronzes \n
of sunburnt breastplates, dying laughter, bruises, \n
rumors of fresh reserves, memories of high treason, \n
laundered banners with imprints of the many \n
who since have risen. \n
All's overgrown with people. A ruin's a rather stubborn \n
architectural style. And the hearts's distinction \n
from a pitch-black cavern \n
isn't that great; not great enough to fear \n
that we may collide again like blind eggs somewhere. \n
At sunrise, when nobody stares at one's face, I often, \n
set out on foot to a monument cast in molten \n
lengthy bad dreams. And it says on the plinth "commander \n
in chief." But it reads "in grief," or "in brief," \n
or "in going under." \n<|endoftext|>
elegy \n
Oh, let me not serve so, as those men serve \n
Whom honour's smokes at once fatten and starve; \n
Poorly enrich't with great men's words or looks; \n
Nor so write my name in thy loving books \n
As those idolatrous flatterers, which still \n
Their Prince's styles, with many realms fulfil \n
Whence they no tribute have, and where no sway. \n
Such services I offer as shall pay \n
Themselves, I hate dead names: Oh then let me \n
Favourite in Ordinary, or no favourite be. \n
When my soul was in her own body sheathed, \n
Nor yet by oaths betrothed, nor kisses breathed \n
Into my Purgatory, faithless thee, \n
Thy heart seemed wax, and steel thy constancy: \n
So, careless flowers strowed on the waters face \n
The curled whirlpools suck, smack, and embrace, \n
Yet drown them; so, the taper's beamy eye \n
Amorously twinkling beckons the giddy fly, \n
Yet burns his wings; and such the devil is, \n
Scarce visiting them who are entirely his. \n
When I behold a stream which, from the spring, \n
Doth with doubtful melodious murmuring, \n
Or in a speechless slumber, calmly ride \n
Her wedded channels' bosom, and then chide \n
And bend her brows, and swell if any bough \n
Do but stoop down, or kiss her upmost brow: \n
Yet, if her often gnawing kisses win \n
The traiterous bank to gape, and let her in, \n
She rusheth violently, and doth divorce \n
Her from her native, and her long-kept course, \n
And roars, and braves it, and in gallant scorn, \n
In flattering eddies promising retorn, \n
She flouts the channel, who thenceforth is dry; \n
Then say I, That is she, and this am I. \n
Yet let not thy deep bitterness beget \n
Careless despair in me, for that will whet \n
My mind to scorn; and Oh, love dulled with pain \n
Was ne'er so wise, nor well armed as disdain. \n
Then with new eyes I shall survey thee, and spy \n
Death in thy cheeks, and darkness in thine eye. \n
Though hope bred faith and love: thus taught, I shall, \n
As nations do from Rome, from thy love fall. \n
My hate shall outgrow thine, and utterly \n
I will renounce thy dalliance: and when I \n
Am the recusant, in that resolute state, \n
What hurts it me to be excommunicate? \n<|endoftext|>
elegy \n
MADAM— \n
That I might make your cabinet my tomb, \n
And for my fame, which I love next my soul, \n
Next to my soul provide the happiest room, \n
Admit to that place this last funeral scroll. \n
Others by wills give legacies, but I \n
Dying, of you do beg a legacy. \n
My fortune and my will this custom break, \n
When we are senseless grown to make stones speak, \n
Though no stone tell thee what I was, yet thou \n
In my grave's inside seest what thou art now, \n
Yet thou 'rt not yet so good ; till death us lay \n
To ripe and mellow there, we're stubborn clay. \n
Parents make us earth, and souls dignify \n
Us to be glass ; here to grow gold we lie. \n
Whilst in our souls sin bred and pamper'd is, \n
Our souls become worm-eaten carcases. \n<|endoftext|>
elegy \n
In summer's heat and mid-time of the day \n
To rest my limbs upon a bed I lay, \n
One window shut, the other open stood, \n
Which gave such light, as twinkles in a wood, \n
Like twilight glimpse at setting of the sun, \n
Or night being past, and yet not day begun. \n
Such light to shamefast maidens must be shown, \n
Where they must sport, and seem to be unknown. \n
Then came Corinna in a long loose gown, \n
Her white neck hid with tresses hanging down: \n
Resembling fair Semiramis going to bed \n
Or Layis of a thousand wooers sped. \n
I snatched her gown, being thin, the harm was small, \n
Yet strived she to be covered there withal. \n
And striving thus as one that would be chaste, \n
Betrayed herself, and yeilded at the last. \n
Stark naked as she stood before mine eye, \n
Not one wen in her body could I spy. \n
What arms and shoulders did I touch and see, \n
How apt her breasts were to be pressed by me. \n
How smooth a belly under her waist saw I? \n
How large a leg, and what a lusty thigh? \n
To leave the rest, all liked me passing well, \n
I clinged her naked body, down she fell, \n
Judge you the rest, being tired she bade me kiss, \n
Jove sent me more such afternoons as this. \n<|endoftext|>
elegy \n
COME Fates ; I fear you not ! All whom I owe \n
Are paid, but you ; then 'rest me ere I go. \n
But Chance from you all sovereignty hath got ; \n
Love woundeth none but those whom Death dares not ; \n
True if you were, and just in equity, \n
I should have vanquish'd her, as you did me ; \n
Else lovers should not brave Death's pains, and live ; \n
But 'tis a rule, “ Death comes not to relieve.” \n
Or, pale and wan Death's terrors, are they laid \n
So deep in lovers, they make Death afraid ? \n
Or—the least comfort—have I company ? \n
O'ercame she Fates, Love, Death, as well as me ? \n
Yes, Fates do silk unto her distaff pay, \n
For ransom, which tax they on us do lay. \n
Love gives her youth—which is the reason why \n
Youths, for her sake, some wither and some die. \n
Poor Death can nothing give ; yet, for her sake, \n
Still in her turn, he doth a lover take. \n
And if Death should prove false, she fears him not ; \n
Our Muses, to redeem her, she hath got. \n
That fatal night we last kiss'd, I thus pray'd, \n
—Or rather, thus despair'd, I should have said— \n
Kisses, and yet despair ! The forbid tree \n
Did promise (and deceive) no more than she. \n
Like lambs, that see their teats, and must eat hay, \n
A food, whose taste hath made me pine away. \n
Dives, when thou saw'st bliss, and craved'st to touch \n
A drop of water, thy great pains were such. \n
Here grief wants a fresh wit, for mine being spent, \n
And my sighs weary, groans are all my rent. \n
Unable longer to endure the pain, \n
They break like thunder, and do bring down rain. \n
Thus till dry tear solder my eye, I weep ; \n
And then, I dream, how you securely sleep, \n
And in your dreams do laugh at me. I hate, \n
And pray Love all may ; he pities my state, \n
But says, I therein no revenge shall find ; \n
The sun would shine, though all the world were blind. \n
Yet, to try my hate, Love show'd me your tear ; \n
And I had died, had not your smile been there. \n
Your frown undoes me ; your smile is my wealth ; \n
And as you please to look, I have my health. \n
Methought, Love pitying me, when he saw this, \n
Gave me your hands, the backs and palms to kiss. \n
That cured me not, but to bear pain gave strength ; \n
And what is lost in force, is took in length. \n
I call'd on Love again, who fear'd you so, \n
That his compassion still proved greater woe ; \n
For, then I dream'd I was in bed with you, \n
But durst not feel, for fear it should not be true. \n
This merits not your anger, had it been ; \n
The queen of chastity was naked seen ; \n
And in bed not to feel, the pain I took, \n
Was more than for Actæon not to look ; \n
And that breast which lay ope, I did not know, \n
But for the clearness, from a lump of snow ; \n
Nor that sweet teat which on the top it bore \n
From the rose-bud which for my sake you wore. \n
These griefs to issue forth, by verse I prove ; \n
Or turn their course by travel and new love. \n
All would not do ; the best at last I tried ; \n
Unable longer to hold out, I died. \n
And then I found I lost life, death by flying ; \n
Who hundreds live, are but so long in dying. \n
Charon did let me pass ; I'll him requite. \n
To mark the groves or shades wrongs my delight ; \n
I'll speak but of those ghosts I found alone, \n
Those thousand ghosts, whereof myself made one, \n
All images of thee ; I asked them why ? \n
The judge told me, all they for thee did die, \n
And therefore had for their Elysian bliss, \n
In one another their own loves to kiss. \n
O here I miss'd not blissh, but being dead ; \n
For lo ! I dreamt, I dreamt, and waking said, \n
“ Heaven, if who are in thee there must dwell, \n
How is't I now was there, and now I fell ?” \n<|endoftext|>
elegy \n
Near the lone pile with ivy overspread, \n
Fast by the rivulet's sleep-persuading sound, \n
Where 'sleeps the moonlight' on yon verdant bed-- \n
O humbly press that consecrated ground! \n
For there does Edmund rest, the learned swain! \n
And there his spirit most delights to rove: \n
Young Edmund! famed for each harmonious strain, \n
And the sore wounds of ill-requited love. \n
Like some tall tree that spreads its branches wide, \n
And loads the west wind with its soft perfume, \n
His manhood blossomed: till the faithless pride \n
Of fair Matilda sank him to the tomb. \n
But soon did righteous Heaven her guilt pursue! \n
Where'er with wildered step she wandered pale, \n
Still Edmund's image rose to blast her view, \n
Still Edmund's voice accused her in each gale. \n
With keen regret, and conscious guilt's alarms, \n
Amid the pomp of affluence she pined; \n
Nor all that lured her faith from Edmund's arms \n
Could lull the wakeful horror of her mind. \n
Go, Traveller! tell the tale with sorrow fraught: \n
Some tearful maid perchance, or blooming youth, \n
May hold it in remembrance; and be taught \n
That riches cannot pay for Love or Truth. \n<|endoftext|>
elegy \n
There will be rose and rhododendron \n
When you are dead and under ground; \n
Still will be heard from white syringas \n
Heavy with bees, a sunny sound; \n
Still will the tamaracks be raining \n
After the rain has ceased, and still \n
Will there be robins in the stubble, \n
Brown sheep upon the warm green hill. \n
Spring will not ail nor autumn falter; \n
Nothing will know that you are gone, \n
Saving alone some sullen plough-land \n
None but yourself sets foot upon; \n
Saving the may-weed and the pig-weed \n
Nothing will know that you are dead,— \n
These, and perhaps a useless wagon \n
Standing beside some tumbled shed. \n
Oh, there will pass with your great passing \n
Little of beauty not your own,— \n
Only the light from common water, \n
Only the grace from simple stone! \n<|endoftext|>
elegy \n
Too much my heart of Beauty's power hath known, \n
Too long to Love hath reason left her throne; \n
Too long my genius mourn'd his myrtle chain, \n
And three rich years of youth consum'd in vain. \n
My wishes, lull'd with soft inglorious dreams, \n
Forgot the patriot's and the sage's themes: \n
Through each Elysian vale and fairy grove, \n
Through all the enchanted paradise of love, \n
Misled by sickly hope's deceitful flame, \n
Averse to action, and renouncing fame. \n
At last the visionary scenes decay, \n
My eyes, exulting, bless the new-born day, \n
Whose faithful beams detect the dangerous road \n
In which my heedless feet securely trod, \n
And strip the phantoms of their lying charms \n
That lur'd my soul from Wisdom's peaceful arms. \n
For silver streams and banks bespread with flowers, \n
For mossy couches and harmonious bowers, \n
Lo! barren heaths appear, and pathless woods, \n
And rocks hung dreadful o'er unfathom'd floods: \n
For openness of heart, for tender smiles, \n
Looks fraught with love, and wrath-disarming wiles; \n
Lo! sullen Spite, and perjur'd Lust of Gain, \n
And cruel Pride, and crueller Disdain; \n
Lo! cordial Faith to idiot airs refin'd, \n
Now coolly civil, now transporting kind. \n
For graceful Ease, lo! Affectation walks; \n
And dull Half-sense, for Wit and Wisdom talks. \n
New to each hour what low delight succeeds, \n
What precious furniture of hearts and heads! \n
By nought their prudence, but by getting, known, \n
And all their courage in deceiving shown. \n
See next what plagues attend the lover's state, \n
What frightful forms of Terror, Scorn, and Hate! \n
See burning Fury heaven and earth defy! \n
See Dumb Despair in icy fetters lie! \n
See black Suspicion bend his gloomy brow, \n
The hideous image of himself to view! \n
And fond Belief, with all a lover's flame, \n
Sink in those arms that point his head with shame! \n
There wan Dejection, faltering as he goes, \n
In shades and silence vainly seeks repose; \n
Musing through pathless wilds, consumes the day, \n
Then lost in darkness weeps the hours away. \n
Here the gay crowd of Luxury advance, \n
Some touch the lyre, and others urge the dance; \n
On every head the rosy garland glows, \n
In every hand the golden goblet flows \n
The Syren views them with exulting eyes, \n
And laughs at bashful Virtue as she flies. \n
But see behind, where Scorn and Want appear, \n
The grave remonstrance and the witty sneer; \n
See fell Remorse in action, prompt to dart \n
Her snaky poison through the conscious heart; \n
And Sloth to cancel, with oblivious shame, \n
The fair memorial of recording Fame. \n
Are these delights that one would wish to gain? \n
Is this the Elysium of a sober brain? \n
To wait for happiness in female smiles, \n
Bear all her scorn, be caught with all her wiles, \n
With prayers, with bribes, with lies, her pity crave, \n
Bless her hard bonds, and boast to be her slave; \n
To feel, for trifles, a distracting train \n
Of hopes and terrors equally in vain; \n
This hour to tremble, and the next to glow, \n
Can Pride, can Sense, can Reason, stoop so low? \n
When Virtue, at an easier price, displays \n
The sacred wreaths of honourable praise; \n
When Wisdom utters her divine decree, \n
To laugh at pompous Folly, and be free. \n
I bid adieu, then, to these woful scenes; \n
I bid adieu to all the sex of queens; \n
Adieu to every suffering, simple soul, \n
That lets a woman's will his ease control. \n
There laugh, ye witty; and rebuke, ye grave! \n
For me, I scorn to boast that I'm a slave. \n
I bid the whining brotherhood be gone: \n
Joy to my heart! my wishes are my own! \n
Farewell the female heaven, the female hell; \n
To the great God of Love a glad farewell. \n
Is this the triumph of thy awful name? \n
Are these the splendid hopes that urg'd thy aim, \n
When first my bosom own'd thy haughty sway? \n
When thus Minerva heard thee boasting, say, \n
“Go, martial maid, elsewhere thy arts employ, \n
Nor hope to shelter that devoted boy, \n
Go teach the solemn sons of Care and Age, \n
The pensive statesman, and the midnight sage: \n
The young with me must other lessons prove, \n
Youth calls for Pleasure, Pleasure calls for Love. \n
Behold, his heart thy grave advice disdains; \n
Behold, I bind him in eternal chains.” \n
Alas! great Love, how idle was the boast! \n
Thy chains are broken, and thy lessons lost; \n
Thy wilful rage has tir'd my suffering heart, \n
And passion, reason, forc'd thee to depart. \n
But wherefore dost thou linger on thy way? \n
Why vainly search for some pretence to stay, \n
When crowds of vassals court thy pleasing yoke, \n
And countless victims bow them to the stroke? \n
Lo! round thy shrine a thousand youths advance, \n
Warm with the gentle ardours of romance; \n
Each longs to assert thy cause with feats of arms, \n
And make the world confess Dulcinea's charms. \n
Ten thousand girls with flowery chaplets crown'd, \n
To groves and streams thy tender triumph sound: \n
Each bids the stream in murmurs speak her flame, \n
Each calls the grove to sigh her shepherd's name. \n
But, if thy pride such easy honour scorn, \n
If nobler trophies must thy toil adorn, \n
Behold yon flowery antiquated maid \n
Bright in the bloom of threescore years display'd; \n
Her shalt thou bind in thy delightful chains, \n
And thrill with gentle pangs her wither'd veins, \n
Her frosty cheek with crimson blushes dye, \n
With dreams of rapture melt her maudlin eye. \n
Turn then thy labours to the servile crowd, \n
Entice the wary, and control the proud; \n
Make the sad miser his best gains forego, \n
The solemn statesman sigh to be a beau, \n
The bold coquette with fondest passions burn, \n
The Bacchanalian o'er his bottle mourn; \n
And that chief glory of thy power maintain, \n
“To poise ambition in a female brain.” \n
Be these thy triumphs; but no more presume \n
That my rebellious heart will yield thee room: \n
I know thy puny force, thy simple wiles; \n
I break triumphant through thy flimsy toils; \n
I see thy dying lamp's last languid glow, \n
Thy arrows blunted and unbrac'd thy bow. \n
I feel diviner fires my breast inflame, \n
To active science, and ingenuous fame; \n
Resume the paths my earliest choice began, \n
And lose, with pride, the lover in the man. \n<|endoftext|>

The page opens to snow on a field: boot-holed month, black hour \n
the bottle in your coat half voda half winter light. \n
To what and to whom does one say yes? \n
If God were the uncertain, would you cling to him? \n
Beneath a tattoo of stars the gate open, so silent so like a tomb. \n
This is the city you most loved, an empty stairwell \n
where the next rain lifts invisibly from the Seine. \n
With solitude, your coat open, you walk \n
steadily as if the railings were there and your hands weren't passing \n
through them. \n
"When things were ready, they poured on fuel and touched off the fire. \n
They waited for a high wind. It was very fine, that powdered bone. \n
It was put into sacks, and when there was enough we went to a bridge \n
on the Narew River." \n
And even less explicit phrases survived: \n
"To make charcoal. \n
For laundry irons." \n
And so we revolt against silence with a bit of speaking. \n
The page is a charred field where the dead would have written \n
We went on. And it was like living through something again one \n
could not live through again. \n
The soul behind you no longer inhabits your life: the unlit house \n
with its breathless windows and a chimney of ruined wings \n
where wind becomes an aria, your name, voices from a field, \n
And you, smoke, dissonance, a psalm, a stairwell. \n
Anonymous submission. \n<|endoftext|>

Although thy hand and faith, and good works too, \n
Have seal'd thy love which nothing should undo, \n
Yea though thou fall back, that apostasy \n
Confirm thy love; yet much, much I fear thee. \n
Women are like the Arts, forc'd unto none, \n
Open to'all searchers, unpriz'd, if unknown. \n
If I have caught a bird, and let him fly, \n
Another fouler using these means, as I, \n
May catch the same bird; and, as these things be, \n
Women are made for men, not him, nor me. \n
Foxes and goats; all beasts change when they please, \n
Shall women, more hot, wily, wild then these, \n
Be bound to one man, and did Nature then \n
Idly make them apter to endure than men? \n
They are our clogges, not their owne; if a man be \n
Chain'd to a galley, yet the galley is free; \n
Who hath a plow-land, casts all his seed corn there, \n
And yet allows his ground more corn should bear; \n
Though Danuby into the sea must flow, \n
The sea receives the Rhene, Volga, and Po. \n
By nature, which gave it, this liberty \n
Thou lov'st, but Oh! canst thou love it and me? \n
Likeness glues love: Then if so thou do, \n
To make us like and love, must I change too? \n
More than thy hate, I hate it, rather let me \n
Allow her change, then change as oft as she, \n
And so not teach, but force my opinion \n
To love not any one, nor every one. \n
To live in one land is captivity, \n
To run all countries, a wild roguery; \n
Waters stink soon, if in one place they bide, \n
And in the vast sea are worse putrified: \n
But when they kiss one bank, and leaving this \n
Never look back, but the next bank do kiss, \n
Then are they purest; Change is the nursery \n
Of music, joy, life, and eternity. \n<|endoftext|>

'It is the voice of years that are gone! \n
they roll before me with all their deeds.'~OSSIAN \n
Newstead! fast-falling, once-resplendent dome! \n
Religion's shrine! repentant HENRY's pride! \n
Of warriors, monks, and dames the cloister'd tomb, \n
Whose pensive shades around thy ruins glide, \n
Hail to thy pile! more honour'd in thy fall \n
Than modern mansions in their pillar'd state; \n
Proudly majestic frowns thy vaulted hall, \n
Scowling defiance on the blasts of fate. \n
No mail-clad serfs, obedient to their lord, \n
In grim array the crimson cross demand; \n
Or gay assemble round the festive board \n
Their chief's retainers, an immortal band: \n
Else might inspiting Fancy's magic eye \n
Retrace their progress through the lapse of time, \n
Marking each ardent youth, ordaln'd to die, \n
A votive pilgrim in Judea's clime. \n
But not from thee, dark pile! departs the chief; \n
His feudal realm in other regions lay: \n
In thee the wounded conscience courts relief, \n
Retiring from the garish blare of day. \n
Yes! in thy gloomy cells and shades profound \n
The monk abjured a world he ne'er could view; \n
Or blood-stain'd guilt repenting solace found, \n
Or innocence from stern oppression flew. \n
A monarch bade thee from that wild arise, \n
Where Sherwood's outlaws once were wont to prowl; \n
And Superstition's crimes, of various dyes, \n
Sought shelter in the priest's protecting cowl. \n
Where now the grass exhales a murky dew, \n
The humid pail of life-extinguish'd clay, \n
In sainted fame the sacred fathers grew, \n
Nor raised their pious voices but to pray. \n
Where now the bats their wavering wings extend \n
Soon as the gloaming spreads her waning shade, \n
The choir did oft their mingling vespers blend, \n
Or matin orisons to Mary pald. \n
Years roll on years; to ages, ages yield; \n
Abbots to abbots, in a line, succeed; \n
Religion's charter their protecting shield, \n
Till royal sacrilege their doom decreed, \n
One holy HENRY rear'd the Gothic walls, \n
And bade the pious inmates rest in peace \n
Another HENRY the kind gift recalls, \n
And bids devotion's hallow'd echos cease. \n
Vain is each threat or supplicating prayer; \n
He drives them exiles from their blest abode, \n
To roam a dreary world in deep despair — \n
No friend, no home, no refuge, but their God. \n
Hark how the hall, resounding to the strain \n
Shakes with the martial music's novel din! \n
The heralds of a warrior's haughty reign, \n
High crested banners wave thy wails within. \n
Of changing sentinels the distant hum, \n
The mirth of feasts, the clang of burnish'd arms, \n
The braying trumpet and the hoarser drum, \n
Unite in concert with increased alarms. \n
An abbey once, a regal fortress now, \n
Encircled by insulting rebel powers, \n
War's dread machines o'erhang thy threat'ning brow, \n
And dart destruction in sulphureous showers. \n
Ah vain defence! the hostile traitor's siege, \n
Though oft repulsed, by guile o'er-comes the brave; \n
His thronging foes oppress the faithful liege, \n
Rebellion's reeking standards o'er him wave. \n
Not unavenged the raging baron yields; \n
The blood of traitors smears the purple plain \n
Unconqu'r'd still, his falchion there he wields, \n
And days of glory yet for him remain. \n
Still in that hour the warrior wish'd to strew \n
Self-gather'd laurel on a self-sought grave; \n
But Charles' protecting genius hither flew, \n
The monarch's friend, the monarch's hope, to save. \n
Trembling, she snatch'd him ftom th' unequal strife, \n
In other fields the torrent to repel; \n
For nobler combats, here reservedhis life, \n
To lead the hand where godlike FALKLAND fell \n
From thee, poor pile! to lawless plunder given, \n
While dying groans their painful requiem sound, \n
Far different incense now ascends to heaven, \n
Such victims wallow on the gory ground. \n
There many a pale and ruthless robber's corse, \n
Noisome and ghast, defiles thy sacred sod; \n
O'er mingling man, and horse commix'd with horse, \n
Corruption's heap, the savage spoilers trod. \n
Graves, long with rank and sighing weeds o'erspread, \n
Ransack'd, resign perforce their mortal mould: \n
From ruffian fangs escape not e'en the dead, \n
Raked from repose in search of buried gold. \n
Hush'd is the harp, unstrung the warlike lyre' \n
The minstrel's palsied hand reclines in death; \n
No more he strikes the quivering chords with fire, \n
Or sings the glories of the martial wreath. \n
At length the sated murderers, gorged with prey, \n
Retire: the clamour of the fight is o'er; \n
Silence again resumes her awful sway, \n
And sable Horror guards the massy door. \n
Here Desolation holds her dreary court: \n
What satellites declare her dismal reign! \n
Shrieking their dirge, ill-omen'd birds resort, \n
To flit their vigils in the hoary fane. \n
Soon a new morn's restoring beams dispel \n
The clouds of anarchy from Britain's skies; \n
The fierce usurper seeks his native hell, \n
And Nature triumphs as the tyrant dies. \n
With storms she welcomes his expiring groans \n
Whirlwinds, responsive, greet his labouring breath; \n
Earth shudders as her caves receive his bones, \n
Loathing the offering of so dark a death. \n
The legal ruler now resumes the helm, \n
He guides through gentle seas the prow of state \n
Hope cheers, with wonted smiles, the peaceful realm, \n
And heals the bleeding wounds of wearied hate. \n
The gloomy tenants, Newstead! of thy cells, \n
Howling, resign their violated nest; \n
Again the master on his tenure dwells, \n
Enjoy'd, from absence, with enraptured zest. \n
Vassals, within thy hospitable pale, \n
Loudly carousing, bless their lord's return. \n
Culture again adorns the gladdening vale, \n
And matrons, once lamenting, cease to mourn. \n
A thousand songs on tuneful echo float, \n
Unwonted foliage mantles o'er the trees; \n
And hark! the horns proclalm a mellow note, \n
The hunters' cry hangs lengthening on the breeze. \n
Beneath their coursers' hoofs the valleys shake: \n
What fears, what anxious hopes attend the chase! \n
The dying stag seeks refuge in the lake; \n
Exulting shouts announce the finish'd race. \n
Ah happy days! too happy to endure! \n
Such simple sports our plain forefathers knew \n
No splendid vices glitter'd to allure; \n
Their joys were many, as their cares were few. \n
From these descending, sons to sires succeed \n
Time steals along, and Death uprears the dart; \n
Another chief impels the foaming steed, \n
Another crowd pursue the panting hart. \n
Newstead! what saddening change of scene is thine! \n
Thy yawning arch betokens slow decay; \n
The last and youngest of a noble line \n
Now holds thy mouldering turrets in his sway. \n
Deserted now, he scans thy gray worn towers; \n
Thy vaults, where dead of feudal ages sleep; \n
Thy cloisters, pervious to the wintry showers \n
These, these he views, and views them but to weep. \n
Yet are his tears no emblem of regret: \n
Cherish'd affection only bids them flow. \n
Pride, hope, and love forbid him to forget \n
But warm his bosom with irnpassion'd glow. \n
Yet he prefers thee to the gilded domes \n
Or gewgaw grottos of the vainly great, \n
Yet lingers 'mid thy damp and mossy tombs, \n
Nor breathes a murmur 'gainst the will of fate. \n
Haply thy sun, emerging, yet may shine, \n
Thee to irradiate with meridian ray; \n
Hours splendid as the past may still be thine, \n
And bless thy future as thy former day. \n<|endoftext|>
elegy \n
Good people all, of every sort, \n
Give ear unto my song; \n
And if you find it wondrous short, \n
It cannot hold you long. \n
In Islington there was a man \n
Of whom the world might say, \n
That still a godly race he ran— \n
Whene'er he went to pray. \n
A kind and gentle heart he had, \n
To comfort friends and foes; \n
The naked every day he clad— \n
When he put on his clothes. \n
And in that town a dog was found, \n
As many dogs there be, \n
Both mongrel, puppy, whelp, and hound, \n
And curs of low degree. \n
This dog and man at first were friends; \n
But when a pique began, \n
The dog, to gain some private ends, \n
Went mad, and bit the man. \n
Around from all the neighbouring streets \n
The wond'ring neighbours ran, \n
And swore the dog had lost its wits \n
To bite so good a man. \n
The wound it seemed both sore and sad \n
To every Christian eye; \n
And while they swore the dog was mad, \n
They swore the man would die. \n
But soon a wonder came to light \n
That showed the rogues they lied,— \n
The man recovered of the bite, \n
The dog it was that died! \n<|endoftext|>
elegy \n
1 Shock's fate I mourn; poor Shock is now no more, \n
2 Ye Muses mourn, ye chamber-maids deplore. \n
3 Unhappy Shock! yet more unhappy fair, \n
4 Doom'd to survive thy joy and only care! \n
5 Thy wretched fingers now no more shall deck, \n
6 And tie the fav'rite ribbon round his neck; \n
7 No more thy hand shall smooth his glossy hair, \n
8 And comb the wavings of his pendent ear. \n
9 Yet cease thy flowing grief, forsaken maid; \n
10 All mortal pleasures in a moment fade: \n
11 Our surest hope is in an hour destroy'd, \n
12 And love, best gift of heav'n, not long enjoy'd. \n
13 Methinks I see her frantic with despair, \n
14 Her streaming eyes, wrung hands, and flowing hair \n
15 Her Mechlen pinners rent the floor bestrow, \n
16 And her torn fan gives real signs of woe. \n
17 Hence Superstition, that tormenting guest, \n
18 That haunts with fancied fears the coward breast; \n
19 No dread events upon his fate attend, \n
20 Stream eyes no more, no more thy tresses rend. \n
21 Tho' certain omens oft forewarn a state, \n
22 And dying lions show the monarch's fate; \n
23 Why should such fears bid Celia's sorrow rise? \n
24 For when a lap-dog falls no lover dies. \n
25 Cease, Celia, cease; restrain thy flowing tears, \n
26 Some warmer passion will dispel thy cares. \n
27 In man you'll find a more substantial bliss, \n
28 More grateful toying, and a sweeter kiss. \n
29 He's dead. Oh lay him gently in the ground! \n
30 And may his tomb be by this verse renown'd. \n
31 Here Shock, the pride of all his kind, is laid; \n
32 Who fawn'd like man, but ne'er like man betray'd. \n<|endoftext|>
elegy \n
'Twas on a joyless and a gloomy morn, \n
Wet was the grass, and hung with pearls the thorn, \n
When Damon, who designed to pass the day \n
With hounds and horns, and chase the flying prey, \n
Rose early from his bed; but soon he found \n
The welkin pitched with sullen clouds around, \n
An eastern wind, and dew upon the ground. \n
Thus while he stood, and sighing did survey \n
The fields, and curst the ill omens of the day, \n
He saw Menalcas come with heavy pace: \n
Wet were his eyes, and cheerless was his face: \n
He wrung his hands, distracted with his care, \n
And sent his voice before him from afar. \n
“Return,” he cried, “return, unhappy swain, \n
The spongy clouds are filled with gathering rain: \n
The promise of the day not only crossed, \n
But even the spring, the spring itself is lost. \n
Amyntas—oh!”—he could not speak the rest, \n
Nor needed, for presaging Damon guessed. \n
Equal with heaven young Damon loved the boy, \n
The boast of nature, both his parents' joy. \n
His graceful form revolving in his mind; \n
So great a genius, and a soul so kind, \n
Gave sad assurance that his fears were true; \n
Too well the envy of the gods he knew: \n
For when their gifts too lavishly are placed, \n
Soon they repent, and will not make them last. \n
For sure it was too bountiful a dole, \n
The mother's features, and the father's soul. \n
Then thus he cried:—“The morn bespoke the news; \n
The morning did her cheerful light diffuse; \n
But see how suddenly she changed her face, \n
And brought on clouds and rain, the day's disgrace; \n
Just such, Amyntas, was thy promised race. \n
What charms adorned thy youth, where nature smiled, \n
And more than man was given us in a child! \n
His infancy was ripe; a soul sublime \n
In years so tender that prevented time: \n
Heaven gave him all at once; then snatched away, \n
Ere mortals all his beauties could survey; \n
Just like the flower that buds and withers in a day.” \n
MENALCAS. \n
The mother, lovely, though with grief opprest, \n
Reclined his dying head upon her breast. \n
The mournful family stood all around; \n
One groan was heard, one universal sound: \n
All were in floods of tears and endless sorrow drowned. \n
So dire a sadness sat on every look, \n
Even Death repented he had given the stroke. \n
He grieved his fatal work had been ordained, \n
But promised length of life to those who yet remained. \n
The mother's and her eldest daughter's grace, \n
It seems, had bribed him to prolong their space. \n
The father bore it with undaunted soul, \n
Like one who durst his destiny control; \n
Yet with becoming grief he bore his part, \n
Resigned his son, but not resigned his heart. \n
Patient as Job; and may he live to see, \n
Like him, a new increasing family! \n
DAMON. \n
Such is my wish, and such my prophecy; \n
For yet, my friend, the beauteous mould remains; \n
Long may she exercise her fruitful pains! \n
But, ah! with better hap, and bring a race \n
More lasting, and endued with equal grace! \n
Equal she may, but farther none can go; \n
For he was all that was exact below. \n
MENALCAS. \n
Damon, behold yon breaking purple cloud; \n
Hear'st thou not hymns and songs divinely loud? \n
There mounts Amyntas; the young cherubs play \n
About their godlike mate, and sing him on his way. \n
He cleaves the liquid air; behold, he flies, \n
And every moment gains upon the skies. \n
The new-come guest admires the ethereal state, \n
The sapphire portal, and the golden gate; \n
And now admitted in the shining throng, \n
He shows the passport which he brought along. \n
His passport is his innocence and grace, \n
Well known to all the natives of the place. \n
Now sing, ye joyful angels, and admire \n
Your brother's voice that comes to mend your quire: \n
Sing you, while endless tears our eyes bestow; \n
For, like Amyntas, none is left below. \n<|endoftext|>
elegy \n
Once, and but once found in thy company, \n
All thy supposed escapes are laid on me; \n
And as a thief at bar is questioned there \n
By all the men that have been robed that year, \n
So am I (by this traiterous means surprized) \n
By thy hydroptic father catechized. \n
Though he had wont to search with glazed eyes, \n
As though he came to kill a cockatrice, \n
Though he hath oft sworn that he would remove \n
Thy beauty's beauty, and food of our love, \n
Hope of his goods, if I with thee were seen, \n
Yet close and secret, as our souls, we've been. \n
Though thy immortal mother, which doth lie \n
Still-buried in her bed, yet wiil not die, \n
Takes this advantage to sleep out daylight, \n
And watch thy entries and returns all night, \n
And, when she takes thy hand, and would seem kind, \n
Doth search what rings and armlets she can find, \n
And kissing, notes the colour of thy face, \n
And fearing lest thou'rt swol'n, doth thee embrace; \n
To try if thou long, doth name strange meats, \n
And notes thy paleness, blushing, sighs, and sweats; \n
And politicly will to thee confess \n
The sins of her own youth's rank lustiness; \n
Yet love these sorceries did remove, and move \n
Thee to gull thine own mother for my love. \n
Thy little brethren, which like faery sprites \n
Oft skipped into our chamber, those sweet nights, \n
And kissed, and ingled on thy father's knee, \n
Were bribed next day to tell what they did see: \n
The grim eight-foot-high iron-bound servingman, \n
That oft names God in oaths, and only then, \n
He that to bar the first gate doth as wide \n
As the great Rhodian Colossus stride, \n
Which, if in hell no other pains there were, \n
Makes me fear hell, because he must be there: \n
Though by thy father he were hired to this, \n
Could never witness any touch or kiss. \n
But Oh, too common ill, I brought with me \n
That which betrayed me to my enemy: \n
A loud perfume, which at my entrance cried \n
Even at thy father's nose, so were we spied; \n
When, like a tyran King, that in his bed \n
Smelt gunpowder, the pale wretch shivered. \n
Had it been some bad smell he would have thought \n
That his own feet, or breath, that smell had wrought. \n
But as we in our isle imprisoned, \n
Where cattle only, and diverse dogs are bred, \n
The precious Unicorns strange monsters call, \n
So thought he good, strange, that had none at all. \n
I taught my silks their whistling to forbear, \n
Even my oppressed shoes dumb and speechless were, \n
Only, thou bitter sweet, whom I had laid \n
Next me, me traiterously hast betrayed, \n
And unsuspected hast invisibly \n
At once fled unto him, and stayed with me. \n
Base excrement of earth, which dost confound \n
Sense from distinguishing the sick from sound; \n
By thee the seely amorous sucks his death \n
By drawing in a leprous harlot's breath; \n
By thee the greatest stain to man's estate \n
Falls on us, to be called effeminate; \n
Though you be much loved in the Prince's hall, \n
There, things that seem, exceed substantial. \n
Gods, when ye fumed on altars, were pleased well, \n
Because you were burnt, not that they liked your smell; \n
You're loathsome all, being taken simply alone, \n
Shall we love ill things joined, and hate each one? \n
If you were good, your good doth soon decay; \n
And you are rare, that takes the good away. \n
All my perfumes I give most willingly \n
T' embalm thy father's corse; What? will he die? \n<|endoftext|>
elegy \n
What beck'ning ghost, along the moon-light shade \n
Invites my steps, and points to yonder glade? \n
'Tis she!--but why that bleeding bosom gor'd, \n
Why dimly gleams the visionary sword? \n
Oh ever beauteous, ever friendly! tell, \n
Is it, in heav'n, a crime to love too well? \n
To bear too tender, or too firm a heart, \n
To act a lover's or a Roman's part? \n
Is there no bright reversion in the sky, \n
For those who greatly think, or bravely die? \n
Why bade ye else, ye pow'rs! her soul aspire \n
Above the vulgar flight of low desire? \n
Ambition first sprung from your blest abodes; \n
The glorious fault of angels and of gods; \n
Thence to their images on earth it flows, \n
And in the breasts of kings and heroes glows. \n
Most souls, 'tis true, but peep out once an age, \n
Dull sullen pris'ners in the body's cage: \n
Dim lights of life, that burn a length of years \n
Useless, unseen, as lamps in sepulchres; \n
Like eastern kings a lazy state they keep, \n
And close confin'd to their own palace, sleep. \n
From these perhaps (ere nature bade her die) \n
Fate snatch'd her early to the pitying sky. \n
As into air the purer spirits flow, \n
And sep'rate from their kindred dregs below; \n
So flew the soul to its congenial place, \n
Nor left one virtue to redeem her race. \n
But thou, false guardian of a charge too good, \n
Thou, mean deserter of thy brother's blood! \n
See on these ruby lips the trembling breath, \n
These cheeks now fading at the blast of death: \n
Cold is that breast which warm'd the world before, \n
And those love-darting eyes must roll no more. \n
Thus, if eternal justice rules the ball, \n
Thus shall your wives, and thus your children fall; \n
On all the line a sudden vengeance waits, \n
And frequent hearses shall besiege your gates. \n
There passengers shall stand, and pointing say, \n
(While the long fun'rals blacken all the way) \n
"Lo these were they, whose souls the furies steel'd, \n
And curs'd with hearts unknowing how to yield. \n
Thus unlamented pass the proud away, \n
The gaze of fools, and pageant of a day! \n
So perish all, whose breast ne'er learn'd to glow \n
For others' good, or melt at others' woe." \n
What can atone (oh ever-injur'd shade!) \n
Thy fate unpitied, and thy rites unpaid? \n
No friend's complaint, no kind domestic tear \n
Pleas'd thy pale ghost, or grac'd thy mournful bier. \n
By foreign hands thy dying eyes were clos'd, \n
By foreign hands thy decent limbs compos'd, \n
By foreign hands thy humble grave adorn'd, \n
By strangers honour'd, and by strangers mourn'd! \n
What though no friends in sable weeds appear, \n
Grieve for an hour, perhaps, then mourn a year, \n
And bear about the mockery of woe \n
To midnight dances, and the public show? \n
What though no weeping loves thy ashes grace, \n
Nor polish'd marble emulate thy face? \n
What though no sacred earth allow thee room, \n
Nor hallow'd dirge be mutter'd o'er thy tomb? \n
Yet shall thy grave with rising flow'rs be drest, \n
And the green turf lie lightly on thy breast: \n
There shall the morn her earliest tears bestow, \n
There the first roses of the year shall blow; \n
While angels with their silver wings o'ershade \n
The ground, now sacred by thy reliques made. \n
So peaceful rests, without a stone, a name, \n
What once had beauty, titles, wealth, and fame. \n
How lov'd, how honour'd once, avails thee not, \n
To whom related, or by whom begot; \n
A heap of dust alone remains of thee, \n
'Tis all thou art, and all the proud shall be! \n
Poets themselves must fall, like those they sung, \n
Deaf the prais'd ear, and mute the tuneful tongue. \n
Ev'n he, whose soul now melts in mournful lays, \n
Shall shortly want the gen'rous tear he pays; \n
Then from his closing eyes thy form shall part, \n
And the last pang shall tear thee from his heart, \n
Life's idle business at one gasp be o'er, \n
The Muse forgot, and thou belov'd no more! \n<|endoftext|>

Hail kind Reviver! that canst lull the cares, \n
And every weary sense compose to rest, \n
Lighten th' oppressive load which Anguish bears, \n
And warm with hope the cold desponding breast. \n
Touch'd by thy rod, from Power's majestic brow \n
Drops the gay plume; he pines a lowly clown; \n
And on the cold earth stretch'd the son of Woe \n
Quaffs Pleasure's draught, and wears a fancy'd crown. \n
When rous'd by thee, on boundless pinions born \n
Fancy to fairy scenes exults to rove, \n
Now scales the cliff gay-gleaming on the morn, \n
Now sad and silent treads the deepening grove; \n
Or skims the main, and listens to the storms, \n
Marks the long waves roll far remote away; \n
Or mingling with ten thousand glittering forms \n
Floats on the gale, and basks in purest day. \n
Haply, ere long, pierc'd by the howling blast \n
Through dark and pathless desarts I shall roam, \n
Plunge down th' unfathom'd deep, or shrink aghast \n
Where bursts the shrieking spectre from the tomb: \n
Perhaps loose Luxury's enchanting smile \n
Shall lure my steps to some romantic dale, \n
Where Mirth's light freaks th' unheeded hours beguile, \n
And airs of rapture warble in the gale. \n
Instructive emblem of this mortal state! \n
Where scenes as various every hour arise \n
In swift succession, which the hand of Fate \n
Presents, then snatches from our wondering eyes. \n
Be taught, vain man, how fleeting all thy joys, \n
Thy boasted grandeur, and thy glittering store; \n
Death comes, and all thy fancy'd bliss destroys, \n
Quick as a dream it fades, and is no more. \n
And, sons of Sorrow! though the threatening storm \n
Of angry Fortune overhang a while, \n
Let not her frowns your inward peace deform; \n
Soon happier days in happier climes shall smile. \n
Through earth's throng'd visions while we toss forlorn, \n
'Tis tumult all, and rage, and restless strife; \n
But these shall vanish like the dreams of morn, \n
When Death awakes us to immortal life. \n<|endoftext|>

ode \n
WHERE o'er my head, the deaf'ning Tempest blew, \n
And Night's cold lamp cast forth a feeble ray; \n
Where o'er the woodlands, vivid light'nings flew, \n
Cleft the strong oak, and scorch'd the blossom'd spray; \n
At morn's approach, I mark the sun's warm glow \n
O'er the grey hill a crimson radiance throw; \n
I mark the silv'ry fragrant dew, \n
Give lustre to the vi'let's hue; \n
The shallow rivers o'er their pebbly way, \n
In slow meanders murmuring play; \n
Day spreads her beams, the lofty forest tree, \n
Shakes from its moisten'd head the pearly show'r, \n
All nature, feels the renovating hour, \n
All, but the sorrowing child of cold ADVERSITY; \n
For her, the linnet's downy throat \n
Breathes harmony in vain; \n
Unmov'd, she hears the warbling note \n
In all the melody of song complain; \n
By her unmark'd the flowret's bloom, \n
In vain the landscape sheds perfume; \n
Her languid form, on earth's damp bed, \n
In coarse and tatter'd garb reclines; \n
In silent agony she pines; \n
Or, if she hears some stranger's tread, \n
To a dark nook, ashamed she flies, \n
And with her scanty robe, o'er-shades her weeping eyes. \n
Her hair, dishevel'd, wildly plays \n
With every freezing gale; \n
While down her cold cheek, deadly pale, \n
The tear of pensive sorrow strays; \n
She shuns, the PITY of the proud, \n
Her mind, still triumphs, unsubdu'd \n
Nor stoops, its misery to obtrude, \n
Upon the vulgar croud. \n
Unheeded, and unknown, \n
To some bleak wilderness she flies; \n
And seated on a moss-clad stone, \n
Unwholesome vapours round her rise, \n
And hang their mischiefs on her brow; \n
The ruffian winds, her limbs expose; \n
Still, still, her heart disdains to bow, \n
She cherishes her woes. \n
NOW FAMINE spreads her sable wings; \n
INGRATITUDE insults her pangs; \n
While from a thousand eager fangs, \n
Madd'ning she flies;­The recreant crew \n
With taunting smiles her steps pursue; \n
While on her burning, bleeding heart, \n
Fresh wounded by Affliction's dart, \n
NEGLECT, her icy poison flings; \n
From HOPE's celestial bosom hurl'd, \n
She seeks oblivion's gloom, \n
Now, now, she mocks the barb'rous world, \n

ode \n
When first the fiery-mantled sun \n
His heavenly race begun to run; \n
Round the earth and ocean blue, \n
His children four the Seasons flew. \n
First, in green apparel dancing, \n
The young Spring smiled with angel grace; \n
Rosy summer next advancing, \n
Rushed into her sire's embrace:- \n
Her blue-haired sire, who bade her keep \n
For ever nearest to his smile, \n
On Calpe's olive-shaded steep, \n
On India's citron-covered isles: \n
More remote and buxom-brown, \n
The Queen of vintage bowed before his throne, \n
A rich pomegranate gemmed her gown, \n
A ripe sheaf bound her zone. \n
But howling Winter fled afar, \n
To hills that prop the polar star, \n
And lives on deer-borne car to ride \n
With barren darkness at his side, \n
Round the shore where loud Lofoden \n
Whirls to death the roaring whale, \n
Round the hall where runic Odin \n
Howls his war-song to the gale; \n
Save when adown the ravaged globe \n
He travels on his native storm, \n
Deflowering Nature's grassy robe, \n
And trampling on her faded form:- \n
Till light's returning lord assume \n
The shaft the drives him to his polar field, \n
Of power to pierce his raven plume \n
And crystal-covered shield. \n
Oh, sire of storms! whose savage ear \n
The Lapland drum delights to hear, \n
When frenzy with her blood-shot eye \n
Implores thy dreadful deity, \n
Archangel! power of desolation! \n
Fast descending as thou art, \n
Say, hath mortal invocation \n
Spells to touch thy stony heart? \n
Then, sullen Winter, hear my prayer, \n
And gently rule the ruined year; \n
Nor chill the wanders bosom bare, \n
Nor freeze the wretch's falling tear;- \n
To shuddering Want's unmantled bed \n
Thy horror-breathing agues cease to lead, \n
And gently on the orphan head \n
Of innocence descend.- \n
But chiefly spare, O king of clouds! \n
The sailor on his airy shrouds; \n
When wrecks and beacons strew the steep, \n
And specters walk along the deep. \n
Milder yet thy snowy breezes \n
Pour on yonder tented shores, \n
Where the Rhine's broad billow freezes, \n
Or the Dark-brown Danube roars. \n
Oh, winds of winter! List ye there \n
To many a deep and dying groan; \n
Or start, ye demons of the midnight air, \n
At shrieks and thunders louder than your own. \n
Alas! Even unhallowed breath \n
May spare the victim fallen low; \n
But man will ask no truce of death,- \n
No bounds to human woe. \n<|endoftext|>
ode \n
God of our fathers, known of old -- \n
Lord of our far-flung battle line -- \n
Beneath whose awful hand we hold \n
Dominion over palm and pine -- \n
Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet, \n
Lest we forget -- lest we forget! \n
The tumult and the shouting dies -- \n
The Captains and the Kings depart -- \n
Still stands Thine ancient sacrifice, \n
An humble and a contrite heart. \n
Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet, \n
Lest we forget -- lest we forget! \n
Far-called our navies melt away -- \n
On dune and headland sinks the fire -- \n
Lo, all our pomp of yesterday \n
Is one with Nineveh and Tyre! \n
Judge of the Nations, spare us yet, \n
Lest we forget -- lest we forget! \n
If, drunk with sight of power, we loose \n
Wild tongues that have not Thee in awe -- \n
Such boastings as the Gentiles use, \n
Or lesser breeds without the Law -- \n
Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet, \n
Lest we forget -- lest we forget! \n
For heathen heart that puts her trust \n
In reeking tube and iron shard -- \n
All valiant dust that builds on dust, \n
And guarding calls not Thee to guard. \n
For frantic boast and foolish word, \n
Thy Mercy on Thy People, Lord! \n
Amen. \n

ode \n
The merchant, to secure his treasure, \n
Conveys it in a borrowed name: \n
Euphelia serves to grace my measure; \n
But Cloe is my real flame. \n
My softest verse, my darling lyre \n
Upon Euphelia's toilet lay; \n
When Cloe noted her desire, \n
That I should sing, that I should play. \n
My lyre I tune, my voice I raise; \n
But with my numbers mix my sighs: \n
And whilst I sing Euphelia's praise, \n
I fix my soul on Cloe's eyes. \n
Fair Cloe blushed: Euphelia frowned: \n
I sung and gazed: I played and trembled: \n
And Venus to the Loves around \n
Remarked, how ill we all dissembled. \n<|endoftext|>

Pitter patter -what's the matter? \n
Can't go out and play? \n
Pitter patter - getting madder - \n
Hate this rainy day; \n
Thunder, lightning - it's so frightening! \n
Let's go run and hide, \n
Find a place that's warm and cozy - \n
Leave the storm outside; \n
Splish splash - lightning flash! \n
Between the drops of rain, \n
Tumbling like a waterfall \n
Down the window pane; \n
Something sort of comforting \n
Listening to the rain - \n
Pitter patter, skitter skatter - \n
Like my thoughts today - \n
Washing out the cobwebs \n
Is refreshing - let's go play! \n<|endoftext|>

O my coy darling, still \n
You wear for me the scent \n
Of those long afternoons we spent, \n
The two of us together, \n
Safe in the attic from the jealous eyes \n
Of household spies \n
And the remote buffooneries of the weather; \n
So high, \n
Our sole remaining neighbor was the sky, \n
Which, often enough, at dusk, \n
Leaning its cloudy shoulders on the sill, \n
Used to regard us with a bored and cynical eye. \n
How like the terrified, \n
Shy figure of a bride \n
You stood there then, without your clothes, \n
Drawn up into \n
So classic and so strict a pose \n
Almost, it seemed, our little attic grew \n
Dark with the first charmed night of the honeymoon. \n
Or was it only some obscure \n
Shape of my mother's youth I saw in you, \n
There where the rude shadows of the afternoon \n
Crept up your ankles and you stood \n
Hiding your sex as best you could?-- \n
Prim ghost the evening light shone through. \n<|endoftext|>

I've seen you many times in many places-- \n
Theater, bus, train, or on the street; \n
Smiling in spring rain, in winter sleet, \n
Eyes of any hue in myriad faces; \n
Midnight black, all shades of brown your hair, \n
Long, short, bronze or honey-fair. \n
Instantly have I loved, have never spoken; \n
Slowly a truck passed, a light changed, \n
A door closed--all seemingly pre-arranged-- \n
Then you were gone forever, the spell was broken. \n
Ubiquitios only one, we've met before \n
A hundred times, and we'll meet again \n
As many more; in hills or forest glen, \n
On crowded street or lonely, peaceful shore; \n
Somewhere, someday--but how will we ever know \n
True love, how wil we ever know? \n<|endoftext|>

LEST as the immortal gods is he, \n
The youth who fondly sits by thee, \n
And hears and sees thee, all the while, \n
Softly speaks and sweetly smile. \n
'Twas this deprived my soul of rest, \n
And raised such tumults in my breast; \n
For, while I gazed, in transport tossed, \n
My breath was gone, my voice was lost; \n
My bosom glowed; the subtle flame \n
Ran quick through all my vital frame; \n
O'er my dim eyes a darkness hung; \n
My ears with hollow murmurs rung; \n
In dewy damps my limbs were chilled; \n
My blood with gentle horrors thrilled: \n
My feeble pulse forgot to play; \n
I fainted, sunk, and died away. \n<|endoftext|>
ode \n
(To have been read before the statue of Lafayette and Washington in Paris, on Decoration Day, May 30, 1916). \n
I \n
Ay, it is fitting on this holiday, \n
Commemorative of our soldier dead, \n
When -- with sweet flowers of our New England May \n
Hiding the lichened stones by fifty years made gray -- \n
Their graves in every town are garlanded, \n
That pious tribute should be given too \n
To our intrepid few \n
Obscurely fallen here beyond the seas. \n
Those to preserve their country's greatness died; \n
But by the death of these \n
Something that we can look upon with pride \n
Has been achieved, nor wholly unreplied \n
Can sneerers triumph in the charge they make \n
That from a war where Freedom was at stake \n
America withheld and, daunted, stood aside. \n
II \n
Be they remembered here with each reviving spring, \n
Not only that in May, when life is loveliest, \n
Around Neuville-Saint-Vaast and the disputed crest \n
Of Vimy, they, superb, unfaltering, \n
In that fine onslaught that no fire could halt, \n
Parted impetuous to their first assault; \n
But that they brought fresh hearts and springlike too \n
To that high mission, and 'tis meet to strew \n
With twigs of lilac and spring's earliest rose \n
The cenotaph of those \n
Who in the cause that history most endears \n
Fell in the sunny morn and flower of their young years. \n
III \n
et sought they neither recompense nor praise, \n
Nor to be mentioned in another breath \n
Than their blue coated comrades whose great days \n
It was their pride to share -- ay, share even to the death! \n
Nay, rather, France, to you they rendered thanks \n
(Seeing they came for honor, not for gain), \n
Who, opening to them your glorious ranks, \n
Gave them that grand occasion to excel, \n
That chance to live the life most free from stain \n
And that rare privilege of dying well. \n
IV \n
O friends! I know not since that war began \n
From which no people nobly stands aloof \n
If in all moments we have given proof \n
Of virtues that were thought American. \n
I know not if in all things done and said \n
All has been well and good, \n
Or if each one of us can hold his head \n
As proudly as he should, \n
Or, from the pattern of those mighty dead \n
Whose shades our country venerates to-day, \n
If we've not somewhat fallen and somewhat gone astray. \n
But you to whom our land's good name is dear, \n
If there be any here \n
Who wonder if her manhood be decreased, \n
Relaxed its sinews and its blood less red \n
Than that at Shiloh and Antietam shed, \n
Be proud of these, have joy in this at least, \n
And cry: "Now heaven be praised \n
That in that hour that most imperilled her, \n
Menaced her liberty who foremost raised \n
Europe's bright flag of freedom, some there were \n
Who, not unmindful of the antique debt, \n
Came back the generous path of Lafayette; \n
And when of a most formidable foe \n
She checked each onset, arduous to stem -- \n
Foiled and frustrated them -- \n
On those red fields where blow with furious blow \n
Was countered, whether the gigantic fray \n
Rolled by the Meuse or at the Bois Sabot, \n
Accents of ours were in the fierce melee; \n
And on those furthest rims of hallowed ground \n
Where the forlorn, the gallant charge expires, \n
When the slain bugler has long ceased to sound, \n
And on the tangled wires \n
The last wild rally staggers, crumbles, stops, \n
Withered beneath the shrapnel's iron showers: -- \n
Now heaven be thanked, we gave a few brave drops; \n
Now heaven be thanked, a few brave drops were ours." \n
V \n
There, holding still, in frozen steadfastness, \n
Their bayonets toward the beckoning frontiers, \n
They lie -- our comrades -- lie among their peers, \n
Clad in the glory of fallen warriors, \n
Grim clusters under thorny trellises, \n
Dry, furthest foam upon disastrous shores, \n
Leaves that made last year beautiful, still strewn \n
Even as they fell, unchanged, beneath the changing moon; \n
And earth in her divine indifference \n
Rolls on, and many paltry things and mean \n
Prate to be heard and caper to be seen. \n
But they are silent, calm; their eloquence \n
Is that incomparable attitude; \n
No human presences their witness are, \n
But summer clouds and sunset crimson-hued, \n
And showers and night winds and the northern star. \n
Nay, even our salutations seem profane, \n
Opposed to their Elysian quietude; \n
Our salutations calling from afar, \n
From our ignobler plane \n
And undistinction of our lesser parts: \n
Hail, brothers, and farewell; you are twice blest, brave hearts. \n
Double your glory is who perished thus, \n
For you have died for France and vindicated us. \n<|endoftext|>
ode \n
'Twas on a lofty vase's side, \n
Where China's gayest art had dy'd \n
The azure flow'rs that blow; \n
Demurest of the tabby kind, \n
The pensive Selima, reclin'd, \n
Gazed on the lake below. \n
Her conscious tail her joy declar'd; \n
The fair round face, the snowy beard, \n
The velvet of her paws, \n
Her coat, that with the tortoise vies, \n
Her ears of jet, and emerald eyes, \n
She saw: and purr'd applause. \n
Still had she gaz'd; but 'midst the tide \n
Two angel forms were seen to glide, \n
The Genii of the stream; \n
Their scaly armour's Tyrian hue \n
Thro' richest purple to the view \n
Betray'd a golden gleam. \n
The hapless Nymph with wonder saw: \n
A whisker first and then a claw, \n
With many an ardent wish, \n
She stretch'd in vain to reach the prize. \n
What female heart can gold despise? \n
What cat's averse to fish? \n
Presumptuous Maid! with looks intent \n
Again she stretch'd, again she bent, \n
Nor knew the gulf between. \n
(Malignant Fate sat by, and smil'd) \n
The slipp'ry verge her feet beguil'd, \n
She tumbled headlong in. \n
Eight times emerging from the flood \n
She mew'd to ev'ry wat'ry god, \n
Some speedy aid to send. \n
No Dolphin came, no Nereid stirr'd; \n
Nor cruel Tom, nor Susan heard. \n
A Fav'rite has no friend! \n
From hence, ye Beauties, undeceiv'd, \n
Know, one false step is ne'er retriev'd, \n
And be with caution bold. \n
Not all that tempts your wand'ring eyes \n
And heedless hearts is lawful prize, \n
Nor all, that glisters, gold. \n<|endoftext|>
ode \n
The Child is father of the Man; \n
And I could wish my days to be \n
Bound each to each by natural piety. \n
I \n
There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream, \n
The earth, and every common sight, \n
To me did seem \n
Apparelled in celestial light, \n
The glory and the freshness of a dream. \n
It is not now as it hath been of yore; - \n
Turn wheresoe'er I may, \n
By night or day, \n
The things which I have seen I now can see no more. \n
II \n
The Rainbow comes and goes, \n
And lovely is the Rose, \n
The Moon doth with delight \n
Look round her when the heavens are bare; \n
Waters on a starry night \n
Are beautiful and fair; \n
The sunshine is a glorious birth; \n
But yet I know, where'er I go, \n
That there hath past away a glory from the earth. \n
III \n
Now, while the birds thus sing a joyous song, \n
And while the young lambs bound \n
As to the tabor's sound, \n
To me alone there came a thought of grief: \n
A timely utterance gave that thought relief, \n
And I again am strong: \n
The cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep; \n
No more shall grief of mine the season wrong; \n
I hear the Echoes through the mountains throng, \n
The Winds come to me from the fields of sleep, \n
And all the earth is gay; \n
Land and sea \n
Give themselves up to jollity, \n
And with the heart of May \n
Doth every Beast keep holiday; - \n
Thou Child of Joy, \n
Shout round me, let me hear thy shouts, thou happy Shepherd-boy! \n
IV \n
Ye blesse`d Creatures, I have heard the call \n
Ye to each other make; I see \n
The heavens laugh with you in your jubilee; \n
My heart is at your festival, \n
My head hath its coronal, \n
The fulness of your bliss, I feel- I feel it all. \n
Oh evil day! if I were sullen \n
While the Earth herself is adorning, \n
This sweet May-morning, \n
And the Children are culling \n
On every side, \n
In a thousand valleys far and wide, \n
Fresh flowers; while the sun shines warm, \n
And the Babe leaps up on his Mother's arm:- \n
I hear, I hear, with joy I hear! \n
- But there's a Tree, of many, one, \n
A single Field which I have looked upon, \n
Both of them speak of something that is gone: \n
The Pansy at my feet \n
Doth the same tale repeat: \n
Whither is fled the visionary gleam? \n
Where is it now, the glory and the dream? \n
V \n
Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting: \n
The Soul that rises with us, our life's Star, \n
Hath had elsewhere its setting, \n
And cometh from afar: \n
Not in entire forgetfulness, \n
And not in utter nakedness, \n
But trailing clouds of glory do we come \n
From God, who is our home: \n
Heaven lies about us in our infancy! \n
Shades of the prison-house begin to close \n
Upon the growing Boy, \n
But He beholds the light, and whence it flows, \n
He sees it in his joy; \n
The Youth, who daily farther from the east \n
Must travel, still is Nature's Priest, \n
And by the vision splendid \n
Is on his way attended; \n
At length the Man perceives it die away, \n
And fade into the light of common day. \n
VI \n
Earth fills her lap with pleasures of her own; \n
Yearnings she hath in her own natural kind, \n
And, even with something of a Mother's mind, \n
And no unworthy aim, \n
The homely Nurse doth all she can \n
To make her Foster-child, her Inmate Man, \n
Forget the glories he hath known, \n
And that imperial palace whence he came. \n
VII \n
Behold the Child among his new-born blisses, \n
A six years' Darling of a pigmy size! \n
See, where 'mid work of his own hand he lies, \n
Fretted by sallies of his mother's kisses, \n
With light upon him from his father's eyes! \n
See, at his feet, some little plan or chart, \n
Some fragment from his dream of human life, \n
Shaped by himself with newly-learned art; \n
A wedding or a festival, \n
A mourning or a funeral; \n
And this hath now his heart, \n
And unto this he frames his song: \n
Then will he fit his tongue \n
To dialogues of business, love, or strife; \n
But it will not be long \n
Ere this be thrown aside, \n
And with new joy and pride \n
The little Actor cons another part; \n
Filling from time to time his 'humorous stage' \n
With all the Persons, down to palsied Age, \n
That Life brings with her in her equipage; \n
As if his whole vocation \n
Were endless imitation. \n
VIII \n
Thou, whose exterior semblance doth belie \n
Thy Soul's immensity; \n
Thou best Philosopher, who yet dost keep \n
Thy heritage, thou Eye among the blind, \n
That, deaf and silent, read'st the eternal deep, \n
Haunted for ever by the eternal mind,- \n
Might Prophet! Seer blest! \n
On whom those truths do rest, \n
Which we are toiling all our lives to find, \n
In darkness lost, the darkness of the grave; \n
Thou, over whom thy Immortality \n
Broods like the Day, a Master o'er a Slave, \n
A Presence which is not to be put by; \n
[To whom the grave \n
Is but a lonely bed without the sense or sight \n
Of day or the warm light, \n
A place of thought where we in waiting lie; ] \n
Thou little Child, yet glorious in the might \n
Of heaven-born freedom on thy being's height, \n
Why with such earnest pains dost thou provoke \n
The years to bring the inevitable yoke, \n
Thus blindly with thy blessedness at strife? \n
Full soon thy Soul shall have her earthly freight, \n
And custom lie upon thee with a weight, \n
Heavy as frost, and deep almost as life! \n
IX \n
O joy! that in our embers \n
Is something that doth live, \n
That nature yet remembers \n
What was so fugitive! \n
The thought of our past years in me doth breed \n
Perpetual benediction: not indeed \n
For that which is most worthy to be blest; \n
Delight and liberty, the simple creed \n
Of Childhood, whether busy or at rest, \n
With new-fledged hope still fluttering in his breast:- \n
Not for these I raise \n
The song of thanks and praise; \n
But for those obstinate questionings \n
Of sense and outward things, \n
Fallings from us, vanishings; \n
Blank misgivings of a Creature \n
Moving about in worlds not realised, \n
High instincts before which our mortal Nature \n
Did tremble like a guilty Thing surprised: \n
But for those first affections, \n
Those shadowy recollections, \n
Which, be they what they may, \n
Are yet the fountain-light of all our day, \n
Are yet a master-light of all our seeing; \n
Uphold us, cherish, and have power to make \n
Our noisy years seem moments in the being \n
Of the eternal Silence: truths that wake, \n
To perish never; \n
Which neither listlessness, nor mad endeavor, \n
Nor Man nor Boy, \n
Nor all that is at enmity with joy, \n
Can utterly abolish or destroy! \n
Hence in a season of calm weather \n
Though inland far we be, \n
Our Souls have sight of that immortal sea \n
Which brought us hither, \n
Can in a moment travel thither, \n
And see the Children sport upon the shore, \n
And hear the mighty waters rolling evermore. \n
X \n
Then sing, ye Birds, sing, sing a joyous song! \n
And yet the young Lambs bound \n
As to the tabor's sound! \n
We in thought will join your throng, \n
Ye that pipe and ye that play, \n
Ye that through your hearts to-day \n
Feel the gladness of the May! \n
What though the radiance which was once so bright \n
Be now for ever taken from my sight, \n
Though nothing can bring back the hour \n
Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower; \n
We will grieve not, rather find \n
Strength in what remains behind; \n
In the primal sympathy \n
Which having been must ever be; \n
In the soothing thoughts that spring \n
Out of human suffering; \n
In the faith that looks through death, \n
In years that bring the philosophic mind. \n
XI \n
And O, ye Fountains, Meadows, Hills, and Groves, \n
Forebode not any severing of our loves! \n
Yet in my heart of hearts I feel your might; \n
I only have relinquished one delight \n
To live beneath your more habitual sway. \n
I love the Brooks which down their channels fret, \n
Even more than when I tripped lightly as they; \n
The innocent brightness of a new-born Day \n
Is lovely yet; \n
The Clouds that gather round the setting sun \n
Do take a sober colouring from an eye \n
That hath kept watch o'er man's mortality; \n
Another race hath been, and other palms are won. \n
Thanks to the human heart by which we live, \n
Thanks to its tenderness, its joys, and fears, \n
To me the meanest flower that blows can give \n
Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears. \n

ode \n
1 \n
Ever musing I delight to tread \n
The Paths of honour and the Myrtle Grove \n
Whilst the pale Moon her beams doth shed \n
On disappointed Love. \n
While Philomel on airy hawthorn Bush \n
Sings sweet and Melancholy, And the thrush \n
Converses with the Dove. \n
2 \n
Gently brawling down the turnpike road, \n
Sweetly noisy falls the Silent Stream-- \n
The Moon emerges from behind a Cloud \n
And darts upon the Myrtle Grove her beam. \n
Ah! then what Lovely Scenes appear, \n
The hut, the Cot, the Grot, and Chapel queer, \n
And eke the Abbey too a mouldering heap, \n
Cnceal'd by aged pines her head doth rear \n
And quite invisible doth take a peep. \n<|endoftext|>

How happy he, who free from care \n
The rage of courts, and noise of towns; \n
Contented breaths his native air, \n
In his own grounds. \n

Whose herds with milk, whose fields with bread, \n
Whose flocks supply him with attire, \n
Whose trees in summer yield him shade, \n
In winter fire. \n

Hours, days, and years slide swift away, \n
In health of body, peace of mind, \n
Quiet by day, \n

Sound sleep by night; study and ease \n
Together mix'd; sweet recreation, \n
And innocence, which most does please, \n
With meditation. \n

Thus unlamented let me dye; \n
Steal from the world, and not a stone \n
Tell where I lye. \n<|endoftext|>

Are they clinging to their crosses, \n
F. E. Smith, \n
Where the Breton boat-fleet tosses, \n
Are they, Smith? \n
Do they, fasting, trembling, bleeding, \n
Wait the news from this our city? \n
Groaning "That's the Second Reading!" \n
Hissing "There is still Committee!" \n
If the voice of Cecil falters, \n
If McKenna's point has pith, \n
Do they tremble for their altars? \n
Do they, Smith? \n
Russian peasants round their pope \n
Huddled, Smith, \n
Hear about it all, I hope, \n
Don't they, Smith? \n
In the mountain hamlets clothing \n
Peaks beyond Caucasian pales, \n
Where Establishment means nothing \n
And they never heard of Wales, \n
Do they read it all in Hansard -- \n
With a crib to read it with -- \n
"Welsh Tithes: Dr. Clifford answered." \n
Really, Smith? \n
In the lands where Christians were, \n
F. E. Smith, \n
In the little lands laid bare, \n
Smith, O Smith! \n
Where the Turkish bands are busy \n
And the Tory name is blessed \n
Since they hailed the Cross of Dizzy \n
On the banners from the West! \n
Men don't think it half so hard if \n
Islam burns their kin and kith, \n
Since a curate lives in Cardiff \n
Saved by Smith. \n
It would greatly, I must own, \n
Soothe me, Smith! \n
If you left this theme alone, \n
Holy Smith! \n
For your legal cause or civil \n
You fight well and get your fee; \n
For your God or dream or devil \n
You will answer, not to me. \n
Talk about the pews and steeples \n
And the cash that goes therewith! \n
But the souls of Christian peoples... \n
Chuck it, Smith! \n<|endoftext|>

Le noir serpent, sorti de sa caverne impure, \n
A donc vu rompre enfin sous ta main ferme et sûre \n
le venimeux tissu de ses jours abhorrés! \n
Aux entrailles du tigre, à ses dents homicides, \n
Tu vins demander et les membres livides \n
Et le sang des humains qu'il avait dévorés! \n
La vertu seule est libre. Honneur de notre histoire, \n
Notre immortel opprobre y vit avec ta gloire. \n
Seule tu fus un homme, et vengea les humains. \n
Et nous, eunuques vils, troupeau lâche et sans âme, \n
Nous savons répéter quelques plaintes de femme, \n
Mais le fer pèserait à nos débiles mains. \n
Un scélérat de moins rampe dans cette fange. \n
La Vertu t'applaudit. De sa mâle louange \n
Entends, bell héroïne, entends l'auguste voix. \n
O Vertu, le poignard, seul espoir de la terre, \n
Est ton arme sacrée, alors que le tonnerre \n
Laisse régner le crime, et te vend à ses lois. \n
English \n
(The black serpent, leaving his filthy cave, \n
Has finally suffered by your hand so sure and brave \n
The end of its venomous existence so despised! \n
From the tiger's guts, from his homicidal teeth \n
You came and drew what he'd devoured from beneath: \n
The blood and livid members of his victims sacrificed.) \n
(Virtue alone is free. Honor of our history, \n
Our immortal shame we live beside your glory. \n
Only you were a man, your knife did vengeance wreak; \n
And we, vile eunuchs, cowardly and soul-less cattle. \n
We can at best complain like women prattle, \n
But to wield a sword our hands would be too weak \n
In that mud crawls one scoundrel less. \n
Hear, lovely heroine, hear Virtue bless, \n
Hear the august voice of its virile praise. \n
Oh virtue, the dagger that hope will raise, \n
Is your sacred arm, when Heaven holds its thunder \n
And lets crime rule, while laws are cut asunder.) \n<|endoftext|>

ode \n
In Lake Forest, a suburb of Chicago, \n
a woman sits at her desk to write \n
me a letter. She holds a photograph \n
of me up to the light, one taken \n
17 years ago in a high school class \n
in Providence. She sighs, and the sigh \n
smells of mouthwash and tobacco. \n
If she were writing by candlelight \n
she would now be in the dark, for \n
a living flame would refuse to be fed \n
by such pure exhaustion. Actually \n
she is in the dark, for the man \n
she's about to address in her odd prose \n
had a life span of one 125th of a second \n
in the eye of a Nikon, and then he \n
politely asked the photographer to \n
get lost, whispering the request so as \n
not to offend the teacher presiding. \n
Those students are now in their thirties, \n
the Episcopal girls in their plaid skirts \n
and bright crested blazers have gone \n
unprepared, though French-speaking, into \n
a world of liars, pimps, and brokers. \n
2.7% have died by their own hands, \n
and all the others have considered \n
the act at least once. Not one now \n
remembers my name, not one recalls \n
the reading I gave of César Vallejo's \n
great "memoriam" to his brother Miguel, \n
not even the girl who sobbed and \n
had to be escorted to the school nurse, \n
calmed, and sent home in a cab. Evenings \n
in Lake Forest in mid-December drop \n
suddenly; one moment the distant sky \n
is a great purple canvas, and then it's \n
gone, and no stars emerge; however, \n
not the least hint of the stockyards \n
or slaughterhouses is allowed to drift \n
out to the suburbs, so it's a deathless \n
darkness with no more perfume than \n
cellophane. "Our souls are mingling \n
now somewhere in the open spaces \n
between Illinois and you," she writes. \n
When I read the letter, two weeks \n
from now, forwarded by my publisher, \n
I will suddenly discover a truth \n
of our lives on earth, and I'll bless \n
Mrs. William Settle of Lake Forest \n
for giving me more than I gave \n
her, for addressing me as Mr. Levine, \n
the name my father bore, a name \n
a man could take with courage \n
and pride into the empire of death. \n
I'll read even unto the second page, \n
unstartled by the phrase "By now \n
you must have guessed, I am \n
a dancer." Soon snow will fall \n
on the Tudor houses of the suburbs, \n
turning the elegant parked sedans \n
into anonymous mounds; the winds \n
will sweep in over the Rockies \n
and across the great freezing plains \n
where America first died, winds \n
so fierce boys and men turn their backs \n
to them and simply weep, and yet \n
in all that air the soul of Mrs. William \n
Settle will not release me, not even \n
for one second. Male and female, \n
aged and middle-aged, we ride it out \n
blown eastward toward our origins, \n
one impure being become wind. Above \n
the Middle West, truth and beauty \n
are one though never meant to be. \n<|endoftext|>

Robert was one of those rare persons that never had a bad word said about him. \n

He was easy-going, affable and fun to be with. \n
He was a hard worker \n
a faithful husband \n
attentive father \n
a good friend and neighbor. \n
He was unassuming \n
and you would never guess \n
that he was awarded the Bronze Star for valor during WWII. \n
He did not like to talk about his exploits during the war. \n
He was a sports enthusiast. \n
He took great pleasure in cheering \n

Elizabeth Steinbruner \n
Born February 23,1920 in Dulsburg, Germany, \n
passed November 17,2005 in Roseville, California. \n
Elizabeth spent much of her youth in Holland. \n
During the German invasion in 1940, \n
she became sympathetic to her Dutch resistance friends, \n
fearlessly confronting the Gestapo \n
who had jailed her fiancee's brother, \n
exposing herself to suspicion and arrest. \n
She lost her fiancee to the war, \n
but was married in 1947 to Fredric Steinbruner \n
whom she met in a refugee camp \n
at the end of the war. They emigrated to \n
the United States in 1954. \n
Elizabeth and her family \n
lived on Fulton Ave. in San Francisco for six years \n
where she washed and folded clothes \n
in the Busy Bee Lauderette. \n
She was active with many crafts, her yoga, \n
bird watching, hiking trails in West Marin, \n
and especially growing exotic plants \n
to new dimensions. \n
We'll remember the walks in Golden Gate Park. \n
We'll remember the Sundays water skiing in Lake Berryessa, \n
and exploring the dunes at Point Reyes. \n
We'll remember her kindness \n
to every stray cat in the neighborhood. \n
We'll remember her patience, understanding \n
and tolerance with her sons, who pushed \n
many limits on their adolescent journey. \n
Mom had a few extra bucks for us, \n
and despite her suffering during the war and thereafter, \n
she never let us go without. \n
Elizabeth was preceded in death \n
by Fredric, her husband of 58 years; \n
and survived by her two sons Peter and Walter \n
and her two grandsons \n
Alex and Andrew of Tahoe City. \n

(Human And Science - Reza Stanza) \n
Humans have come with much science in \n
And out and in many levels, \n
Each level is containing \n
Sections and sections of serials; \n
As, an inner small limb, in fact \n
Is too major a chapter \n
Compared to a part of world outer. \n
Science is found by them everywhere \n
So they can be the scientists, \n
But to be so thoughts require \n
From nature and more experiments; \n
Every object and animal \n
Invite some thoughtful human, \n
"Be scientists and open hidden". \n

Still humans are harming, killing humans \n

Still humans are wasting valuable assets \n

Let's throw all the symptoms of rationalism, \n
Let's burn all that good inventions, \n
Let's forget all that well imaginations, \n
Let's cut off all the good relations, \n

Why can pansies be their aid or paths. \n

Tell him what happened then only to go \n
He nervous as you add only not only as they angry were \n
Be kind to half the time that they shall say \n
It is undoubtedly of them for them for every one any one \n
They thought quietly that Sunday any day she might not come \n
In half a way of coining that they wish it \n
Let it be only known as please which they can underrate \n
They try once to destroy once to destroy as often \n
Better have it changed to pigeons now if the room smokes \n
Not only if it does but happens to happens to have the room smoke all the time. \n
In their way not in their way it can be all arranged \n
Not now we are waiting. \n
I have read that they wish if land is there \n
Land is there if they wish land is there \n
Yes hardly if they wish land is there \n
It is no thought of enterprise there trying \n
Might they claim as well as reclaim. \n
Did she mean that she had nothing. \n
We say he and I that we do not cry \n
Because we have just seen him and called him back \n
He meant to go away \n
Once now I will tell all which they tell lightly. \n
How were we when we met. \n
All of which nobody not we know \n
But it is so. They cannot be allied \n

stanza \n
A lot of skyscrapers, big cities are now worldwide seen \n
The vast areas without trees joined with dead pin, \n
Stones and sands tightly cover irons \n
Irons, stones and sands capture humans, \n
Humans are strongly tied to the iron poles \n
But proud of inventing the modern alls; \n
Machines and media are their life companions \n
With some dry food, dry movements, dry emotions \n
They somehow but luxuriously pass times \n
Machines do the works they sit like machines \n
Machines and humans form union \n
Counter attack goes in man to man, nation to nation, \n
To check it they heed on some plans \n
The machines are developed in weapons \n
Machines, humans, and weapons now exchange feedback \n
I am afraid if mutual reactions make the world hack, \n
Dry emotions have succeeded to fail man understand man \n
And make them very fond of ultra-modern gun, \n
So they deal in guns, atom, hydrogen bombs \n
Multi harmful gunpowder and chemical weapons, \n
To throw these powers worldwide on humans \n
They have invented missiles, fighters and cannons, \n
To make wide wide grave yard in all the dead cities \n
They are busy to fall the rest of the green earth in crises, \n
To remove the darkness from the dead cities \n
They are exploding powers for radiation produces \n
And frequently flying in the air to explore the whole earth \n
To see how much they have advanced in plan and math. \n

You left me with a heart of stone. \n
Do not tell me I am your love, \n
And you can't control what you think. \n
Because of you, of hatred I stink! \n
I wish you hell - I wish to shove... \n
My heart you made become dark, \n
So in fiery words it fumes. \n
I wish you not joy, but tombs, \n
Bitterness and its cursed marks. \n
To you I gave my heart in full; \n
You shredded it - I have none left. \n
To compassion I am now deaf. \n
Broken, I see, I am a fool. \n
For through it all, I still love you, \n
And the things I say I do not mean. \n
It’s a weak heart being obscene. \n
Despite the hurt, I still love you. \n

madrigal \n
Never again would I relegate the pearl found in the black conclave \n
To the dark depths of the abysm of time \n
Never again would I rant and rave hurling infernal profanities \n
At the dispenser of my delusion \n
Long lost in the hurly-burly of illusion \n
Tossing and turning whirling in labyrinths of doubts \n
Irreligion and arrant agnosticism was surging in my veins \n
I desecrated your altar of love reducing the gods of passion to mere playthings \n
On the unloved waves of life I billowed until your queenly fleet appeared \n
And that night of nights you became the stiller of the demented storm in my life \n
It was a miracle meeting you Mirabel \n
I will walk to the altar of love in triumph to be shielded in the benignity \n
Of your incomparable generosity \n
Your beauty a cloak for my demented filth \n
O it is a miracle meeting you Mirabel \n<|endoftext|>

Ma Crisante avec une foi \n
Dont l'âge atteste l'innocence, \n
M'a fait serment qu'en mon absence \n
Elle aura mémoire de moi. \n
Cette faveur si peu commune \n
Me donne tant de vanité \n
Qu'à la même divinité \n
J'ose comparer ma fortune. \n
Peut-être qu'elle me déçoit \n
De m'assurer que cela soit, \n

madrigal \n
Moon can wane, stars can dim, and sun can set, \n
But mark, they always hold on to the sky, \n
As dreams may fade, but hopes can never die; \n
Love sometimes change, hearts also may forget, \n
For dreams are hard to hold, though hard you try, \n
Your moon could wane, stars dim, and sun could set, \n
So best, to always hold on to the sky; \n
And look upwards, with no pain or regret, \n
But do not try to find the reasons why, \n
For life proceeds, by ways none can deny, \n
Moon can wane, stars can dim, and sun can set, \n
So mark, to always hold on to the sky, \n
As dreams may fade, but hopes can never die. \n<|endoftext|>
madrigal \n
May you find help from action figures I keep. \n
May you find them in the top drawer \n
And bring them out while you sleep \n
And I welcome darkness-- \n
The flickering TV, helicopters \n
hopscotched overhead. \n
May these nightdolls help you, \n
When every questionnaire questions you, \n
When diagonal smoke \n
Mafficks treetops. \n
Use this antidote liberally. \n
May your walk to the F train be not alone. \n<|endoftext|>

Sleep's the Great Healer— \n
Sleep's the Revealer \n
Of hidden meanings, \n
Unbidden gleanings. \n
When sorrow aches us, \n
Sleep overtakes us— \n
Stealing away grief, \n
Like a welcome thief. \n
Night is the coverlet \n
For a longing lover— yet \n
It's Sleep who delves \n
Deep into our selves, \n
Finding dusty dreams... on shadowy shelves. \n
When life's a jailor, \n
Sleep's the unveiler \n
Of an inner key... \n
To set us free. \n
Sleep's our best friend \n
At a hard day's end— \n
Weaver of fantasy... with reality, \n
Make-believer of what could be... \n
Sleep's the Great Healer... of you and me. \n<|endoftext|>

Dear, can we endure to know \n
How these jasmine-girdled hours \n
Shall become the long ago? \n
Love, can we endure to know \n
How our longing and our woe \n
Fall like autumn-loosened flowers \n
Down the gulf of days foredone \n
On unstelled oblivion? \n
Love, can we endure to prove \n
How no longest pang or pleasure \n
Lengthens out the lot of love? \n
Dear, can we endure to prove \n
How the sharpening moons will measure \n
Our permitted joys, and pass \n
Autumnward on withered grass? \n<|endoftext|>

The sun shines fair on Tweedside, the river flowing bright, \n
Your heart is full of pleasure, your eyes are full of light, \n
Your cheeks are like the morning, your pearls are like the dew, \n
Or morning and her dew-drops are like your pearls and you. \n
Because you are a princess, a princess of the land, \n
You will not turn your lightsome eyes a moment where I stand, \n
A poor unnoticed poet, a-making of his rhymes; \n
But I have found a mistress, more fair a thousand times. \n
`Tis May, the elfish maiden, the daughter of the Spring, \n
Upon whose birthday morning the birds delight to sing. \n
They would not sing one note for you, if you should so command, \n
Although you are a princess, a princess of the land. \n<|endoftext|>

Sure by this meanes all men t'ensnare, \n
She toss'd the streamers with her breath, \n
And seem'd to boast a world with death: \n

To flie the burning of thine eyes; \n

madrigal \n
(ON THE APPROACH OF SPRING) \n
Oh, come, my beloved, from thy winter abode, \n
From thy home on the Yuba, thy ranch overflowed; \n
For the waters have fallen, the winter has fled, \n
And the river once more has returned to its bed. \n
Oh, mark how the spring in its beauty is near! \n
How the fences and tules once more reappear! \n
How soft lies the mud on the banks of yon slough \n
By the hole in the levee the waters broke through! \n
All nature, dear Chloris, is blooming to greet \n
The glance of your eye and the tread of your feet; \n
For the trails are all open, the roads are all free, \n
And the highwayman's whistle is heard on the lea. \n
Again swings the lash on the high mountain trail, \n
And the pipe of the packer is scenting the gale; \n
The oath and the jest ringing high o'er the plain, \n
Where the smut is not always confined to the grain. \n
Once more glares the sunlight on awning and roof, \n
Once more the red clay's pulverized by the hoof, \n
Once more the dust powders the 'outsides' with red, \n
Once more at the station the whiskey is spread. \n
Then fly with me, love, ere the summer's begun, \n
And the mercury mounts to one hundred and one; \n
Ere the grass now so green shall be withered and sear, \n
In the spring that obtains but one month in the year. \n<|endoftext|>
madrigal \n
What's it to me that you are sage? \n
Be beautiful! and be sad! Tears \n
Add a charm to the countenance \n
As a stream does to a landscape; \n
Storms make the flowers fresh again. \n
I love you most of all when joy \n
Flees from your oppressed brow, \n
When your heart is drowned in horror, \n
When the frightful cloud of the Past \n
Is spread out over your Present. \n
I love you when your large eyes shed \n
Tears as hot as blood, when \n
In spite of my hand which lulls you \n
Your unbearable pain comes through \n
Like a dying man's death-rattle. \n
I breathe in, heavenly pleasure! \n
Profound, delightful hymn! \n
Every sob from your breast \n
And I believe your heart lights up \n
With the pearls that your eyes pour out! \n
II \n
I know, your heart, overflowing \n
With old, uprooted loves, \n
Still blazes like a forge \n
And that there smolders in your breast \n
Something of the pride of the damned; \n
But my sweet, so long as your dreams \n
Have not reflected Hell, \n
While in a nightmare without respite, \n
Dreaming of poisons and daggers, \n
Enamored with powder and steel, \n
Answering the door fearfully, \n
Seeing misfortune everywhere, \n
Convulsing when the hour strikes, \n
You have not felt yourself embraced \n
By irresistible Disgust; \n
You cannot, slave and queen \n
Who love me only with terror, \n
In the unhealthy night's horror \n
Say to me, your soul full of cries, \n
'I am your equal, O my King! ' \n<|endoftext|>

I get down and move the car from \n
the place reserved for vans. \n
This the best of times cooling before the heat begins \n
only a few people out walking their dogs enjoying \n
the peace of a beginning. \n
I could have parked my car in the space between \n
two cars, but I lose my nerves, this after 60 years of driving. \n
in the night the wind blew hard from the sea \n
tiring itself out, and me too I hate the wind it takes my breath away \n
leaves me a husk falling asleep in front of the TV. \n
Yesterday I carried water to the house, the porter usually \n
do this but my wife thinks he takes too much money. \n
Being able to carry bottles of water is better than not being \n

I enfold her as if I hold in my hands \n
A diaphanous shawl woven loosely \n
From silken skeins of hope and fear. I feel \n
Strongly, she’s so much part of me. Obliviously \n
She wriggles free. I glance at my daughter \n
Her mum, and marvel at inheritance. \n
I wrap all this stuff of inheritance \n
Into trust, quietly hoping the safe hands \n
Of my kindly, compassionate daughter \n
Will suffice. Experience tells me loosely \n
Held reigns are best. The child plays obliviously. \n
I watch. She echoes in me. Trembling I feel \n
The pain inevitably she will feel. \n
I fear quietly; knowing her inheritance; \n
The curse of memory. Now obliviously \n
She recalls careless conversation. Hands \n
On to me stray words, understood loosely \n
With looks I try to forewarn my daughter \n
But the treacherous trait has skipped. My daughter \n
Down to earth, sensible, is born not to feel \n
Hurts that haunt, doubts that linger loosely. \n
If only we could choose the inheritance \n
We bequeath. But it is out of our hands, \n
We make love, create life obliviously. \n
I say nothing, pretend obliviously \n
Disguise fears I dare not share. My daughter \n
Who loves her, is all she needs. Holding hands \n
We walk through bustling, crowded streets. I feel \n
Her tiny linked fingers. The inheritance \n
Of knowing held gently within mine, loosely. \n
The web of my life was woven loosely \n
I held fast to no-one. Obliviously \n
This child makes me unearth an inheritance \n
Painstakingly hid. Bonded by my daughter \n
To my granddaughter tenderly I feel \n
Burning passions branded into our hands. \n
Envoi \n
I held her loosely, I let my daughter \n
Feel, obliviously unaware of my \n
Inheritance, she unbinds my hands \n<|endoftext|>

I \n
Coming into the valley there are three distinct ways \n
and one I see but two of them are totally out of sight \n
on foggy days but can be seen on the open sunny days, \n
while outside it's as dim as if in the falling kind of light, \n
while in the rain outside still the birds do God praise, \n
and in the distance is the big sold dark hill at its height. \n
II \n
My love is at my hearts breadth, depth and its height \n
where it comes to you in all the words, deeds and ways \n
that can bring you happiness, respect and great praise, \n
even in the unsaid things that remains out of sight, \n
where you face and eyes do glow as if with an own light, \n
where you do enchant and liven up my days \n
III \n
and here in this lovely vale without you I have days \n
where it is as this kind of pain is at its height \n
and from this separation between us there is no light, \n
where our lives had gone in their different ways \n
and without you the future seems dim and out of sight, \n
where for this kind of life there is no praise \n
IV \n
but daily I pray for us both and still do God praise, \n
pray that He in omnipotence would straighten our days, \n
where He is my friend but holy and out of sight, \n
lives far off glorious, are respected on His height, \n
but right here do daily care in many small ways, \n
are for me the direction and in life the light. \n
V \n
I wish that you could experience with me the morning light, \n
that with the different birds we could together God praise, \n
where nature has a great beauty in almost all of its ways, \n
where we could wander through the veldt on sunny days, \n
could climb the mountain up to its highest height \n
and all of the town and countryside would be a sight. \n
VI \n
In your new life our love for each other might be out of sight, \n
where in your work you are constantly in the light, \n
are now at your career's ultimate impressive height \n
and people do you daily impress, admire and praise, \n
where only work and some more work are in your days, \n
where we do both view life in totally different ways. \n
VII l'Envoi \n
Writing this you call and do me praise, say my poetry is at its height, \n
you say you have our love and my words in sight, in dusk's fading light, \n
promise to compensate in many ways that you will be here in three more days. \n

sestina \n
What dark thoughts fill a killer’s mind \n
To perpetrate that heinous deed \n
Without a thought of guilt, regret \n
Or stinging punishment, or dread \n
For his own life in prison spent \n
Because of all the woe he caused? \n
Imagine what torment had caused \n
That person to acquire a mind \n
Which could have been far better spent \n
In nobler thought and word and deed \n
And surely would recoil in dread \n
From causing even slight regret. \n
When Cain killed Abel, much regret \n
His jealous action might have caused \n
himself — a looming cloud of dread \n
That could have plagued his guilty mind \n
As he reviewed the selfish deed \n
On which his innocence was spent. \n
We judge our taxes poorly spent: \n
In backlash guilt do we regret \n
That laws cannot reverse the deed \n
That our dysfunction may have caused, \n
Engendering a killer’s mind \n
That fills our very hearts with dread. \n
But, other than from his own dread, \n
How could his life have been mis-spent \n
Pursuing in his darkling mind \n
The ways to make us all regret \n
The mayhem he has rudely caused \n
By dint of his most wanton deed? \n
Yes, irreversible the deed, \n
Profound the lingering thoughts of dread \n
The murderer has sorely caused; \n
Misguided effort he has spent \n
To maximize untold regret, \n
The product of his tragic mind. \n
But though the killer’s deed was spent \n
In spreading dread and dire regret, \n
He caused more harm to his own mind. \n<|endoftext|>

November bomb-fires refuse to take light \n
Like sultry splutters of a lazy passion. \n
And drowsy hedgehogs under dead, damp wood \n
Dream snail’s trail filaments of kiss and touch. \n
Autumnal sodden leaves, leave underfoot, \n
A worn, discarded carpet once so lush. \n
Cold winter heart of mornings, sunlight lush, \n
Spangle frosts on bare branches and delight \n
In shining grass blades crunching underfoot. \n
Invade my sleepy heart, excite my passion. \n
I yearn for kisses, search for trembling touch. \n
Tentatively snap dead-wood’s bitter wood. \n
Rising greenly, sap springs through new wood, \n
Feeding fresh leaf, nourishing bud till lush \n
Summer arrives. Await the radiant touch! \n
Anticipate! The sun’s young rays spread light, \n
Tempting seeds of lust to swell in passion, \n
Crushing memories which echo underfoot. \n
Wise warnings thud above whilst underfoot \n
The thundering tramplings of the wild, wild wood \n
Call out. “Unleash your thwarted passion. \n
Drink in the nectar of life’s root, the lush \n
Intoxicating spirit that sets light \n
Your body with the need for urgent touch. \n
Laden boughs bend overhead to touch \n
A verdant rug of green laid underfoot. \n
Sky brightness winks and blinks. The broken light \n
Peeps through. Charcoal dark, my cleft heart of wood \n
Remnant of fire, lies guarded in the lush \n
Cutting blades of grass that hide my passion. \n
Leaves scuttle, dry husks rush round with passion \n
Press-ganged by the wind. Gems dyed by the touch \n
Of death in glowing hues. Fruit full and lush \n
With wasps, reaping juice fallen underfoot. \n
For good, my soul is yearly marked like wood \n
Rings revealing all, sealed away from light. \n

The tangled wood reminds me of your hair - \n
dark like the night and falling in whispers. \n
Kneeling underneath the sheltering pines, \n
I sip silence and stroke the memories. \n
You have long been gone, and I miss your hands, \n
slipping through the long sleeves of languid love. \n
Time is a leaf on the branch of our love, \n
curled in the corners of your chestnut hair \n
and falling like sand through hourglass hands. \n
Wind strokes my back and quietly whispers. \n
Stars float down a dark sky of memories, \n
their bright pulse like beacons above the pines. \n
Thus hangs the moon, suspended among pines, \n
promising brighter days showered with love; \n
but for now, I live in the memories. \n
I braid a blue blossom into my hair, \n
its fragrance wafting like weary whispers, \n
spider-spun silk in the palm of my hands. \n
I remember how you captured my hands, \n
held them within the shadow of the pines, \n
and kissed them soft as butterfly whispers. \n
It was then that I knew I was in love, \n
when you gently stroked the length of my hair, \n
now curled within the moonlight memories. \n
Moonlight makes magic of the memories, \n
within the palms of her shimmering hands, \n
and she sprinkles starlight throughout my hair. \n
Initials are carved in one of the pines \n
within a whimsical heart made with love \n
and sanctified with undying whispers. \n
The past unfolds in wandering whispers, \n
ushered through the gate of my memories. \n
I write a letter of undying love, \n
hold it like seeds in the palm of my hands, \n
and plant it with a kiss beneath the pines \n
as the wind looses a wisp of my hair. \n
The pale wings of my love move like whispers, \n
tangling in your hair like memories \n
captured within your hands beneath the pines. \n<|endoftext|>
sestina \n
Old Salem was a peaceful little town \n
In Massachusetts, set beside a hill. \n
Its people knelt to God in prayer each day, \n
To ask Him for forgiveness for their sin \n
And from temptation to deliver them. \n
'Twas thus till early Sixteen Ninety-One. \n
Among those righteous people there was one \n
Who was a stranger in that godly town. \n
Tituba, slave from islands far from them, \n
Had come to share their village by the hill. \n
She brought with her a darker kind of sin \n
Than anyone had seen before that day. \n
Surrounded by some girls one winter day, \n
Warmed by the fire, Tituba was the one \n
Who read their palms-and led them into sin. \n
Soon evil rumors raced throughout the town- \n
A horror darker than that shadowed hill. \n
Black magic-voodoo spells-Woe unto them! \n
A doctor checked the girls, pronouncing them \n
Bewitched! And following that fateful day, \n
A panic spread to reach beyond the hill. \n
Suspicious eyes were cast on every one \n
Who was the least bit odd, in that strange town. \n
To be eccentric was a deadly sin. \n
The townsfolk called them witches, cursed with sin, \n
And quickly moved to purge themselves of them. \n
They tried the victims in that dreadful town \n
For one whole year, day after shameful day. \n
They jailed a hundred fifty, one by one, \n
And twenty more they hanged on Gallows Hill! \n
What happened in the shadows of that hill \n
Where wives and daughters, innocent of sin, \n
Were punished when accused by anyone \n
Who bore resentment or a grudge toward them? \n
A truly evil thing began that day \n
When madness swept good sense from Salem town. \n
May we escape the sin that captured them, \n
And wisely judge each one, unlike that day \n
Below the hill when justice fled the town. \n<|endoftext|>
sestina \n
She lifts my eyes to consider more sweetly the alluring logic of her sway \n
Absolute in her twilight thighs, simply to strut back and forth in my view \n
While my thoughts crawl throughout the perception of her pleasures \n
Upon the pleasant poetry that her body composes within her every footstep \n
My own desires are resurrected, time and time again, by her radiant eyes \n
Revealing to me the brilliant visions that her ecstasy is capable of conceiving \n
Time is but divided into the seconds, minutes, and hours that each thought is conceived \n
Content in the nonchalant conversations that causes our gestures to linger and sway \n
Drawing me but closer into the goddess that is sheer genius, flickering within her eyes \n
The laughter in her smiles perverse my hunger about her moans upon a balcony view \n
Luring me to imagine fiery images of her splendid nakedness, oceanic in every footstep \n
Whereas the moonlight pours shivering enchantment that flows from her pleasures \n
Portrayals – oh, I do indeed have portrayals that are my interpretations of her pleasures: \n
The waterfalls that overflows from her womanly wonders that her passion conceives \n
All divided by backside arches, trembling moans, and her subtle spreads by a single footstep \n
In addition to the rippling wobbles that her buttocks produce within gyrating sway \n
Kneeling to witness the goddess of her thighs that completely captures my entire view \n
Embraced by the euphoric elegance that she embraces me with, within her euphoric eyes \n
The warmth in her wetness drowns the whispers of my every kiss, while I look into her eyes \n
Milking the majesty that marvels meretriciously throughout her murmuring pleasures \n
The crowning canvas of her breasts are cradled in her arms as her ecstasy is clear in her view \n
Alerting of the audacious avalanches that her affections are leading to utterly conceive \n
While her hips circle into passionate oblivion, as my hands steady her shivering sway \n
Reminiscing upon my other images where my thrusts would induce her airborne footsteps \n
My ears again, listening to her whispers – her passion, guiding me as caressing footsteps \n
As I indulge blindly inside of all her wildfire, due to the excitement of my closed eyes \n
Thus to experience an otherworldly nirvana that spirals from the sweetness of her sway \n
Wherefore I ravish and kiss the gush of her climax that splashes into pools of pleasure \n
Accurate in the achievement that her body promptly delivers and splendidly conceives \n
Allured by her womanly sleeve, underneath her buxom needs, that flaunts for my view \n
Henceforth, her vulgar delicacy triggers my appreciation for her mannerism and views \n
Witty in her womanly sprawling, gristle-fare, yet not obese, about her strutting footsteps \n
My temptations about her spectacular tabernacle-like teases, as my beliefs are conceived \n
Ironically, there is sincere integrity that blossoms, deeply folly, in her dark brown eyes \n
Strolling throughout the sensations that summon my infatuations of her private pleasures \n
Apparent in my idolizing her feline movements that shimmies her bottom as she sways \n
Thus her sensual point of view is within the presence of my ever watching eyes \n
Catching the symmetry of her footsteps, this is, to me, a witnessing pleasure \n
Still conceiving more voracious thoughts, every time I capture her sway \n<|endoftext|>

The year is fading away \n
From us in December’s snow and cold; \n
But Christmas is coming soon— \n
What joy that season will bring! \n
And how swift the foot of time! \n
How brief a thing is life! \n
I wonder whether I would prefer death to life, \n
That it shall be taken away \n
From me, and I shall live a short time \n
Only; I think of the icy cold \n
That Death will bring \n
Me soon: \n
Soon enough, or is it, perhaps, too soon, \n
To be taken, willing or unwilling, from a life, \n
That one’s parents did bring \n
One unconscious and unwilling; that taken away, \n
A life that perhaps, is dismal, dank, and cold; \n
But it must be, in a short time. \n
Or is it a long time? \n
Whether that is true or not, it feels too soon \n
And not soon enough to plunge into the cold \n
Waters of death from the comfort of life, \n
If it is comfort we are taken away \n
From. I want God to bring \n
Me to heaven; but I do not deserve Him to bring \n
Me there—not at this time; \n
But there is a way \n
When God wills it so, so soon; \n
When God wills it so with one’s life, \n
Which in itself was bleak and cold. \n
When I am dead I shall not feel cold; \n
If, as I hope, God shall bring \n
Me to heaven, I shall not be cold in that life, \n
Nor in hell, the thought of which fills me with dread, hot as hell all the time, \n
Not cold; I shall feel the warmth soon; \n
This life will soon melt away. \n
How cold it is in this life all the time! \n
God brings His Son; Christmas comes soon: \n
And life, at last, it vanishes away. \n

My eyes stung with the sight of her. Light played \n
on the lace of her dress, stroking the breast \n
that I knew like my own. I could not breathe \n
when she cried and promised she would not think \n
of this as goodbye. The sun on her skin \n
was too much. She leaned up for a last kiss \n
and I was lost. It was like our first kiss \n
in the dead of night. The scent of her played \n
tricks on my mind. Told myself skin was skin, \n
it didn’t matter. Hers arched hip to breast \n
to my mouth, pale as whalebone. You don’t think \n
you should think, moments like these. You don’t breathe \n
and you’re dizzy from forgetting to breathe. \n
Coming up, looking for air from her kiss \n
her face was bone white in moonlight. I think \n
every vein could be seen. Her muscles played, \n
pallid and bloodless and strange in her breast. \n
It was like she was the night. In her skin \n
played the drama of stars, using my skin \n
as the moon. Mouth close to my ear to breathe \n
she’d never leave, she was home on my breast, \n
hair spread like a sheet. By morning a kiss \n
of gold representing the day was played \n
in each strand. I hadn’t slept. Had to think \n
what this meant. Problem was, I couldn’t think \n
straight. Months passed, time crawling over my skin \n
like an infection. My mind, ashamed, played \n
havoc. So it began. I couldn’t breathe \n
in her arms, even in private. Her kiss \n
was a suffocation, dressing my breast \n
in chains, a straightjacket pressing her breast \n
too close to my own. Thinking what they’d think \n
back at home. She didn’t care. Thought each kiss \n
a weapon, lined her soldiers on my skin \n
in the gentle art of war. We would breathe \n
our last fighting. After, our shadows played \n
on the walls. Played the heartbeat in my breast. \n
After, I’d breathe the scent of night and think \n
of moonlight on soft skin, gold hair, sharp kiss. \n<|endoftext|>
sestina \n
This field in autumn is quiet, awaiting a winter death \n
to be interred beneath a skyless vault in the shadow \n
of woods that creep and stretch to touch the cooling earth. \n
The ground gives up heat without a sigh, turning in to hold \n
the heart safe from frost. Below, a dark burrow \n
lined with fur already smells of sleep. \n
I come here to name things: blackberry vines matted in sleep, \n
wildflower ghosts, weed-flower faces surprised by death, \n
hollow grasses that bend close to conceal the burrow \n
where small mouths suck life from a dormant form and shadow \n
is lost. Seasons move through a tunnel of moons. Thistles hold \n
the tilted spokes of a spider’s web, a wheel above the earth. \n
I come here, sovereign in this place, and claim the earth \n
when it is quiet and turned away, defenseless in sleep. \n
a frightened quail whirls up at my feet where leaves hold \n
the shape of her body, a whisper of heat. She sees death, \n
I think, dark wings above the field, the wheeling shadow \n
of a hawk in breathless search of a nest, a burrow. \n
A furred body slips past seeking shelter. Its burrow \n
beneath this skin is the warm place where earth \n
keeps her own. There, away from the circling shadow, \n
the twitching dream begins. Animals of prey, in sleep, \n
must still run. The underground rings with echoes of death \n
imagined, flights of the flightless in a predator’s hold. \n
Long nights begin the season of equinox. The skies of autumn hold \n
neither rain nor snow nor sun. The earth-dwellers burrow, \n
hoard seeds, pods, summer’s dry fruit, against death \n
in the hungry winter. I resist the urge to pry into earth, \n
uncover the secret cache and hold it in my hands. In sleep \n
sometimes, I have wings, feather-stroke, a hawk’s shadow. \n
small bodies jerk in the dream of the circling shadow \n
that passes overhead. Here is where I always wake, hold \n
myself still, remembering the bones cracked in sleep, \n
the warm marrow sucked from my fingers. That dark burrow \n
is real; I have been there, sleeping beneath the earth \n
among spring-born rabbits. Dreaming, there is no death. \n
I come here to elude death. This autumn field in shadow \n
draws me to the quiet earth, turning inward to hold \n
safe the heart in a fur-lined burrow that smells of sleep. \n<|endoftext|>

'Our fourth millennium A.D. course is plot', \n
'whereby we triumph over man machine'. \n
'I'm here to guide the bird-made meteor light', \n
'so we can wing ascent; see what I mean'? ' \n
‘Just then a ratty mammal, snide and mean, \n
who hid within the cycad's curving claw, \n
quick swiped the heedless bird in dusky light \n

The meteor missed and dinosaur machine \n
retained its topmost spot, in spite of plot'. \n
The father closes zany fiction plot \n
and though his sharp-toothed grin looks wily mean, \n
he is a loving dinosaur machine. \n
The sleepy dino-child lets go his claw \n
and slips into a dreaming world absurd. \n

Hastily convened by Kuno Meyer \n
To impose upon the Man of Business. \n

Disapproves of Otia Merseiana, \n
Turns his back on Doctor Kuno Meyer; \n
Cannot be enticed by Mister Sampson, \n
To be present at the Bogus Meetings, \n
Though attended by Professor Woodward. \n
Little cares the staid Professor Woodward: \n
He, being something of a man of business, \n
Knows that not a hundred Bogus Meetings \n
To discuss the Otia Merseiana \n
Can involve himself and Mister Sampson \n
In the debts of Doctor Kuno Meyer. \n
So the poor deluded Kuno Meyer, \n
Unenlightened by Professor Woodward -- \n
Whom, upon the word of Mister Sampson, \n
He believes to be a man of business \n
Fit to run the Otia Merseiana -- \n

Every week has now its Bogus Meetings, \n
Punctually convened by Kuno Meyer \n

A girl was lying down flat on her back \n
with a straw hat at eye height over hair, \n
she was sun-struck, curling and fair \n
with a rain cloud ominous and black \n
drifting in a blue sky and a small track \n
meandering past and it needed some repair. \n
Some of your makeup is in need of repair, \n
there’s a guitar bag slung over your back \n
where you walk pass the girl at the dirt track \n
with the strong wind frizzling through your hair \n
and the sky is already turning black \n
but the evening up to now is fair. \n
Slowly you walk past the local fair \n
with some of the stalls needing repair, \n
the guitar you are carrying is black \n
and you walk straight on, do not look back \n
at the whistles of some men with long hair \n
while home you take a narrow long track. \n
Watching our horses on the racetrack \n
you are really sexy and very fair, \n
our horses do parade with shining hair \n
you notice that the stands need some repair \n
and I am standing somewhat at your back \n
while you are dressed prettily in black. \n
The highway is like a ribbon that is black \n
where it meets the old overgrown farm track, \n
there are huge blue-gum trees some way back \n
and you agree that the price of the Lucerne is fair \n
where some cows graze at the pen, needing repair, \n
swishing with tails to drive flies from their hair. \n
I pull my fingers slowly through my hair \n
and there are streaks of grey in the black, \n
but the cattle are only doing fair \n
while my love is coming with the field’s track \n
that must constantly be kept in repair \n
and I hear her singing over my back. \n
There were torn out hair a long time back, \n
when I met my darling and she was fair, \n
at a fight at a track, I was in need of repair. \n<|endoftext|>

Atop the mountain, \n

Stiff, blinded with snow, \n
One knew what to do. \n
Meanwhile it is not easy here in Katmandu, \n

Elsewhere, but here means flowers, \n
Comes down, \n

The potter carried home a broken plate \n
and passing through a grove of tall bamboo, \n
some thing within disturbed the verdant sheen. \n
Intrigued, he stopped awhile to rest and wait. \n
A bird shot skyward, straight as arrow true, \n
turned somersaults and plunged back into green. \n
The bird had left the safety of the green, \n
to see from high the land as coloured plate. \n
An overview, to give perspective true. \n
Imprint in mind a map of home's bamboo \n
and then to hide and rest in patient wait, \n
before an insect hunt by thin moon's sheen. \n
The potter's wife delighted in the sheen, \n
of jagged shards of crackle-glazed jade green. \n
With supper not quite ready, while he wait, \n
he set about to mend the shattered plate. \n
When laid beside their wares of plain bamboo, \n
it's beauty shone and both declared this true. \n
The potter was perfectionist, it's true, \n
who long had strived to replicate the sheen, \n
of leafy shades of celadon bamboo. \n
One day, the kiln revealed translucent green. \n
The pottery's proud owner chose a plate, \n
as gift to Empress, hopeful then to wait. \n
Official staff with retinue in wait, \n
by Emperor's decree paid tribute true. \n
A portered chair arrived of fine gold-plate, \n
to honour maker of such lovely sheen. \n
Asway, the potter turned a sickly green \n
and gripped the shouldered poles of stout bamboo. \n
In city, thoughts returned to tall bamboo \n
and how it seemed the bird could hardly wait, \n
to fly back home within the dappled green. \n
The potter's mind was strong, his heart was true. \n
He learned of commerce, trade and coin's sheen, \n
but dreamt of home and wife and mended plate. \n
Back home, at last, amongst the green bamboo, \n
rich plate collectors, clothed in silken sheen, \n
confirmed that true rewards are worth the wait. \n<|endoftext|>

The Angelic Music soars and swells, \n
And, in the Garden that I love, \n
I hear the sound of Christmas Bells. \n
From hamlet hollow, village height, \n
The silvery Message seems to start, \n
And, far away, its notes to-night \n
Are surging through the city's heart. \n
Assurance clear to those who fret \n
O'er vanished Faith and feelings fled, \n
That not in English homes is yet \n
Tradition dumb, or Reverence dead: \n
Nor, when anew from town-girt tower \n
Or fen-swept spire the Yule-bells peal, \n
Are those who watch o'er England's power \n
Too wise to pray, too proud to kneel. \n
Now onward floats the sacred tale, \n
Past leafless woodlands, freezing rills; \n
It wakes from sleep the silent vale, \n
It skims the mere, it scales the hills; \n
And, rippling on up rings of space, \n
Sounds faint and fainter as more high, \n
Till mortal ear no more may trace \n
The music homeward to the sky. \n
To courtly roof and rustic cot \n
Old comrades wend from far and wide: \n
Now is the ancient feud forgot, \n
The growing grudge is laid aside. \n
Bright on the board the gifts are spread, \n

The boar's is now the laurelled head, \n
Now is the Feast of simple folk. \n
The agëd tell of ancient cheer, \n
And boast 'twas merrier then than now; \n
The children shout `A glad New Year!' \n
And kiss beneath the berried bough. \n
But, in the pauses of their mirth, \n
The Heavenly Hymn is carolled still: \n
`Glory to God on high, on Earth \n
Peace, and to all mankind good-will.' \n
Peace and good-will 'twixt rich and poor! \n
Good-will and peace 'twixt class and class! \n
Let old with new, let Prince with boor, \n
Send round the bowl, and drain the glass! \n
That still behind the steely sea, \n
That guards our greatness like a sword, \n
The free-born children of the free \n
May own one law, one land, one lord; \n
And never in our midst may sound \n
Discordant voice or threat morose, \n
But every Year that circles round \n
May find and bind us yet more close. \n
But not alone for those who still \n
Within the Mother-Land abide, \n
We deck the porch, we dress the sill, \n
And fling the portals open wide. \n
But unto all of British blood,- \n
Whether they cling to Egbert's Throne, \n
Or, far beyond the Western flood, \n
Have reared a Sceptre of their own, \n
And, half-regretful, yearn to win \n
Their way back home, and fondly claim \n
The rightful share of kith and kin \n
In Alfred's glory, Shakespeare's fame,- \n
We pile the logs, we troll the stave, \n
We waft the tidings wide and far, \n
And speed the wish, on wind and wave, \n
To Southern Cross and Northern Star. \n
Yes! Peace on earth, Atlantic strand! \n
Peace and good-will, Pacific shore! \n
Across the waters stretch your hand, \n
And be our brothers more and more! \n
Blood of our blood, in every clime! \n
Race of our race, by every sea! \n
To you we sing the Christmas rhyme, \n
For you we light the Christmas-tree. \n<|endoftext|>

carol \n
WHEN loud by landside streamlets gush, \n
And clear in the greenwood quires the thrush, \n
With sun on the meadows \n
And songs in the shadows \n
Comes again to me \n
The gift of the tongues of the lea, \n
The gift of the tongues of meadows. \n
Straightway my olden heart returns \n
And dances with the dancing burns; \n
It sings with the sparrows; \n
To the rain and the (grimy) barrows \n
Sings my heart aloud - \n
To the silver-bellied cloud, \n
To the silver rainy arrows. \n
It bears the song of the skylark down, \n
And it hears the singing of the town; \n
And youth on the highways \n
And lovers in byways \n
Follows and sees: \n
And hearkens the song of the leas \n
And sings the songs of the highways. \n
So when the earth is alive with gods, \n
And the lusty ploughman breaks the sod, \n
And the grass sings in the meadows, \n
And the flowers smile in the shadows, \n
Sits my heart at ease, \n
Hearing the song of the leas, \n
Singing the songs of the meadows. \n<|endoftext|>
carol \n
A bronzed chest makes me look warlike, \n
But my tongue is the only weapon I yield \n
Ten times stronger than steel is this sword, \n
Therein lays my potency – in my written words! \n
Paint half of my body, to receive the outer side, \n
Touch my pen once, only to fear the coming tide. \n
Touch my heart and thine own I shall too, \n
Kiss me but once, and it would be I and you. \n
Slay my pains, to my face bring in bunches smiles \n
Doing it best, have your father meet me at the aisle \n
And only then, righteously, let our legs entwine \n
Let my body be yours, and yours be mine. \n
Break and bruise my body, leaving but my head; \n
I rather die now, than to then be found dead, \n
Usurp all my wealth, make me humbly kneel, \n
Take all things fleeting, leave that which is real, \n
Smash my bones, if it means I would serve my God, \n
When I’m wrong, give with much grace love’s rod. \n
Bless my pen that it might never go low on ink \n
Give me surplus, make evident before they can wink, \n
Leash my neck, that at furthest I’ll tinkle your name, \n
Never let me stray; never let my doing be for fame, \n
Make bigger my heart, that forever I’ll do your will, \n
Fill it to the brim with love; give until it can spill, \n
Then give more, \n
Let it not keep to spoiling, then pour \n
Always renew afresh… and... \n
Leading my path, always give more, \n
That we may stand victorious at the end of the way. \n

carol \n
Though Christmas comes once every year, \n
Lord Christ was born just once on earth; \n
The Virgin Mary gave Him birth, \n
And saved all mankind from sin's fear. \n
The day reveals God's love for man- \n
By being born in flesh, a boy; \n
This brings immense peace and great joy, \n
And adds true meaning to life-span. \n
Our Savior chose a bed of hay- \n
In Bethlehem's, a stable place; \n
Three Magi, shepherds saw His face, \n
As angels sang, where Jesus lay. \n
God's love was born in human form, \n
And hope afilled each human heart; \n
God's plan was laid right from the start, \n
To free mankind from satan's harm. \n

one day will you wake to say: \n

and troubles flee like night \n
from day \n
the beautiful world has come to stay \n
the stars swirl out as in Van Goghs \n
and all the cherry trees have snows \n
of flowers deep beneath your feet \n

like crystal in the winter air \n

something inside the soul will say \n
the beautiful world has come to stay \n

The snow-capped hills I stare through, \n
And what I gaze beside a wood full of oaks, \n
Sculptured mists in each long bough, \n
With each twig of cuckoo and no more croaks, \n
And frozen waves like a white-manned troop, \n
As if they're blind and their shores in dark, \n
And far away drizzles with each one's own group, \n
O'er peerless beetles beneath all wet barks. \n
Sun's now hidden and nights in dream, \n
With light clouds at edges as black as ink, \n
And icy lakes with drowned man's sweet scream \n
And you go deep in it in each erroneous blink. \n
And what I see are joys in million gowns of dew, \n
All like happy tears of earth in an eon, new. \n<|endoftext|>

carol \n
Looking back upon my youth as \n
the holiday season is near, I can \n
recall the happiness filled with \n
excitement as each day approached \n
I remember the days when Daddy would \n
take us out to cut our very own Christmas \n
tree, and of course, it was the most beautifull \n
tree of all \n
Bringing it home and decorating it with \n
lights of green, red, blue, mother made hot \n
chocolate and chocolate chip cookies for the \n
event, as Daddy was always in his usual place \n
the kitchen trying feverishly to 'unweb' \n
last years string of lighting, we had no \n
stores to run out to get last minute this or that \n
so we had to make do with what we had like \n
every other family and Daddy always came through \n
and the finishing touches were done with tinsel \n
and of course the star up top to offically indicate \n
Christmas was now on its way \n
Looking from my window at night, looking out \n
at the street light which was covered \n
with freshly fallen snow, seeing tiny ice clycles \n
casting their wintery shadows seemed like tiny \n
snow fairies doing their snow dance, the trees \n
were coverd with white snow caps which made \n
a setting like a winter wonderland that would \n
stay in my heart forever \n
Todays world has become so commercialized \n
that the beauty has been taken away somehow, I sound \n
like a very old sentimental fool, but I would not trade \n
those days of my memories from an era where \n
family knew how to celebrate Christmas with the \n
family spirit of togetherness \n
Christmas is that time of year when it \n
brings you back to the time when happiness \n
shadowed each and every jingle bell that \n
we rang filled with much joy and love \n
From my heart to yours, this is my Christmas \n

The Christ-child lay on Mary's lap, \n
His hair was like a light. \n
(O weary, weary were the world, \n
But here is all aright.) \n
The Christ-child lay on Mary's breast \n
His hair was like a star. \n
(O stern and cunning are the kings, \n
But here the true hearts are.) \n
The Christ-child lay on Mary's heart, \n
His hair was like a fire. \n
(O weary, weary is the world, \n
But here the world's desire.) \n
The Christ-child stood on Mary's knee, \n
His hair was like a crown, \n
And all the flowers looked up at Him, \n
And all the stars looked down \n
'A Christmas Carol' poem \n
I \n
The shepherds went their hasty way, \n
And found the lowly stable-shed \n
Where the Virgin-Mother lay: \n
And now they checked their eager tread, \n
For to the Babe, that at her bosom clung, \n
A Mother's song the Virgin-Mother sung. \n
II \n
They told her how a glorious light, \n
Streaming from a heavenly throng. \n
Around them shone, suspending night! \n
While sweeter than a mother's song, \n
Blest Angels heralded the Savior's birth, \n
Glory to God on high! and Peace on Earth. \n
III \n
She listened to the tale divine, \n
And closer still the Babe she pressed: \n
And while she cried, the Babe is mine! \n
The milk rushed faster to her breast: \n
Joy rose within her, like a summer's morn; \n
Peace, Peace on Earth! the Prince of Peace is born. \n
IV \n
Thou Mother of the Prince of Peace, \n
Poor, simple, and of low estate! \n
That strife should vanish, battle cease, \n
O why should this thy soul elate? \n
Sweet Music's loudest note, the Poet's story, \n
Didst thou ne'er love to hear of fame and glory? \n
V \n
And is not War a youthful king, \n
A stately Hero clad in mail? \n
Beneath his footsteps laurels spring; \n
Him Earth's majestic monarchs hail \n
Their friends, their playmate! and his bold bright eye \n
Compels the maiden's love-confessing sigh. \n
VI \n
Tell this in some more courtly scene, \n
To maids and youths in robes of state! \n
I am a woman poor and mean, \n
And wherefore is my soul elate. \n
War is a ruffian, all with guilt defiled, \n
That from the aged father's tears his child! \n
VII \n
A murderous fiend, by fiends adored, \n
He kills the sire and starves the son; \n
The husband kills, and from her board \n
Steals all his widow's toil had won; \n
Plunders God's world of beauty; rends away \n
All safety from the night, all comfort from the day. \n
VIII \n
Then wisely is my soul elate, \n
That strife should vanish, battle cease: \n
I'm poor and of low estate, \n
The Mother of the Prince of Peace. \n
Joy rises in me, like a summer's morn: \n
Peace, Peace on Earth! The Prince of Peace is born! \n<|endoftext|>

pindaric-ode \n
The following Ode is founded on an age-old Tradition, in England, \n
that when a politician makes an almighty cock-up he is, deservedly, \n
detached from his b***ocks, or, to use the vernacular: "gets well and truely knackered "! \n
Weave and wrap and then cry wolf, \n
Seems you are being wound-up Dave, \n
There's someone waiting on the hoof, \n
Or is it Boris just having a rave. \n
Granted you looked good on a surf-board, \n
But d'you think your ratings really soared, \n
When it came to light, \n
That you were, after all, swimming in shite. \n
Speaking of the blond- bomber, I'd rather not, \n
When he says: " Get on yer bike ", \n
Watch-out, and look round a lot, \n
Or risk ending up, like the proverbial pancake! \n
He also has ideas on Flight, combined, \n
With enormous shafting in everyone's behind. \n
Not quite finished with the Right, \n
Before shifting left, for here lies, \n
Farage star once " burning bright ", \n
Talks to himself a lot, won't say his good-byes; \n
Still, talking is cheap, Core-bin snarls, \n
Time to revive the thoughts of good ole Karl. \n
What's one to do in all this mess, \n
There's folks banging desparatly at the gate, \n
And others who want to leave and join Isis; \n
As Thomas Gray wrote, and put it straight: \n
The curfew tolls the day, passing hard, \n
Sounding an elegy for a country, in a junk-yard? \n<|endoftext|>

didactic-poetry \n
When wise Minerva still was young \n
And just the least romantic, \n
Soon after from Jove's head she flung \n
That preternatural antic, \n
'Tis said to keep from idleness \n
Or flirting,—those twin curses,— \n
She spent her leisure, more or less, \n
In writing poems, no, verses. \n
How nice they were! to rhyme with far \n
A kind star did not tarry; \n
The metre, too, was regular \n
As schoolboy's dot and carry; \n
And full they were of pious plums, \n
So extra-super-moral,— \n
For sucking Virtue's tender gums \n
Most tooth-enticing coral. \n
A clean, fair copy she prepares, \n
Makes sure of moods and tenses, \n
With her own hand,—for prudence spares \n
A man- (or woman) -uensis; \n
Complete, and tied with ribbons proud, \n
She hinted soon how cosy a \n
Treat it would be to read them loud \n
After next day's Ambrosia. \n
The Gods thought not it would amuse \n
So much as Homer's Odyssees, \n
But could not very well refuse \n
The properest of Goddesses; \n
So all sat round in attitudes \n
Of various dejection, \n
As with a hem! the queen of prudes \n
Began her grave prelection. \n
At the first pass Zeus said, 'Well sung!— \n
I mean—ask Phoebus,—he knows.' \n
Says Phoebus, 'Zounds! a wolf's among \n
Admetus's merinos! \n
Fine! very fine! but I must go; \n
They stand in need of me there; \n
Excuse me!' snatched his stick, and so \n
Plunged down the gladdened ether. \n
With the next gap, Mars said, 'For me \n
Don't wait,—naught could be finer; \n
But I'm engaged at half-past three,— \n
A fight in Asia Minor!' \n
Then Venus lisped, 'How very thad! \n
It rainth down there in torrinth; \n
But I mutht go, becauthe they've had \n
A thacrifithe in Corinth!' \n
Then Bacchus,—'With those slamming doors \n
I lost the last half dist—(hic!) \n
Mos' bu'ful se'ments! what's the Chor's? \n
My voice shall not be missed—(hic!)' \n
His words woke Hermes; 'Ah!' he said, \n
'I so love moral theses!' \n
Then winked at Hebe, who turned red, \n
And smoothed her apron's creases. \n
Just then Zeus snored,—the Eagle drew \n
His head the wing from under; \n
Zeus snored,—o'er startled Greece there flew \n
The many-volumed thunder; \n
Some augurs counted nine,—some, ten,— \n
Some said, 'twas war,—some, famine,— \n
And all, that other-minded men \n
Would get a precious plunder. \n
Proud Pallas sighed, 'It will not do; \n
Against the Muse I've sinned, oh!' \n
And her torn rhymes sent flying through \n
Olympus's back window. \n
Then, packing up a peplus clean, \n
She took the shortest path thence, \n
And opened, with a mind serene, \n
A Sunday-school in Athens. \n
The verses? Some, in ocean swilled, \n
Killed every fish that bit to 'em; \n
Some Galen caught, and, when distilled, \n
Found morphine the residuum; \n
But some that rotted on the earth \n
Sprang up again in copies, \n
And gave two strong narcotics birth,— \n
Didactic bards and poppies. \n
Years after, when a poet asked \n
The Goddess's opinion, \n
As being one whose soul had basked \n
In Art's clear-aired dominion,— \n
'Discriminate,' she said, 'betimes; \n
The Muse is unforgiving; \n
Put all your beauty in your rhymes, \n
Your morals in your living.' \n<|endoftext|>
blank-verse \n
In youth I rarely prayed \n
So full of self was I \n
A lid of pride so tight \n
Only God could pry it off. \n
This thing called pride \n
Is no small thing \n
My street kids had it \n
And so did I. \n
The tension between us was great. \n
Love held us in its unseen sovereignty, \n
Ruled with a scepter no one saw. \n
At age added, a different scene - \n
Body and mind no longer impervious to time \n
This other thing I sense but can not name \n
A presence always there \n
The thing that gives the modern mind its scare \n
It does not work like gravity \n
But I know it's true, \n
Especially if I'm not too forceful \n
In declaring this truth to you. \n<|endoftext|>

blank-verse \n
Near the lone pile with ivy overspread, \n
Fast by the rivulet's sleep-persuading sound, \n
Where 'sleeps the moonlight' on yon verdant bed-- \n
O humbly press that consecrated ground! \n
For there does Edmund rest, the learned swain! \n
And there his spirit most delights to rove: \n
Young Edmund! famed for each harmonious strain, \n
And the sore wounds of ill-requited love. \n
Like some tall tree that spreads its branches wide, \n
And loads the west wind with its soft perfume, \n
His manhood blossomed: till the faithless pride \n
Of fair Matilda sank him to the tomb. \n
But soon did righteous Heaven her guilt pursue! \n
Where'er with wildered step she wandered pale, \n
Still Edmund's image rose to blast her view, \n
Still Edmund's voice accused her in each gale. \n
With keen regret, and conscious guilt's alarms, \n
Amid the pomp of affluence she pined; \n
Nor all that lured her faith from Edmund's arms \n
Could lull the wakeful horror of her mind. \n
Go, Traveller! tell the tale with sorrow fraught: \n
Some tearful maid perchance, or blooming youth, \n
May hold it in remembrance; and be taught \n
That riches cannot pay for Love or Truth. \n<|endoftext|>
